    chairman’s statement

    during 2013, the fourth full year of production at sukari,
    your company built further on its track record delivering
    against targets whilst maintaining a strong control over
    its cost base.

                                      dear shareholders

                                      during 2013, the fourth full year of production at sukari, your company built
                                      further on its track record delivering against targets, whilst maintaining a strong
                                      control over its cost base. sukari delivered a record 356,943 ounces of gold at
                                      a cash cost of production of us$663 per ounce, which was ahead of guidance
                                      of 320,000 ounces at us$700 per ounce set out in the first quarter of the
                                      year. the operating environment in egypt improved markedly in comparison
                                      with a challenging 2012. i once again take this opportunity to extend my
                                      congratulations to the team in egypt for their professionalism, hard work and
                                      consistent focus on improving productivity, which has resulted in another
                                      year of exceptional performance for the operation. shareholders should not
                                      underestimate these efforts, which allow centamin to stand out in a sector which
                                      generally suffers a reputation of missed forecasts and broken promises.
    josef el‑raghy                    sukari’s safety performance was also a significant improvement on the previous
    chairman and ceo                  year with a lost time injury frequency rate of 0.36 (0.69 in 2012) per 200,000
                                      man hours achieved during the period. it was again pleasing to note that no
                                      significant environmental incidents have taken place.

                                      construction of the stage 4 expansion to double the processing plant’s
                                      nameplate capacity to 10 million tonnes per annum was complete by the end of
                                      2013, and commissioning is currently under way. this major two‑and‑a‑half year
                                      expansion project has been completed with minimal cost and timing overruns.
                                      this would represent a major achievement in itself, but is all the more notable
                                      given the various external challenges that were faced, particularly during the
                                      early stages of construction. the capital cost estimate of the stage 4 expansion is
                                      us$331.2 million including contingency, with expenditure at the end of 2013 of
                                      us$327.8 million.

                                      commissioning and optimisation of the expanded plant is now a key deliverable
                                      as sukari looks towards a further year of growth in 2014, with our annual
                                      production guidance set at 420,000 ounces at a cash cost of us$700 per ounce.
                                      thereafter, we continue to forecast a sustainable output of 450,000 – 500,000
                                      ounces per annum from 2015 onwards, with scope to exceed the upper limit
                                      once the new plant is fully optimised and operating at above‑nameplate levels of

                                      sukari is a long‑life asset which is supported by a globally significant resource

                                      at the end of the year, with total resources containing 15.4 million ounces

                                      estimate, despite mining depletion during that period. with grades in the
                                      proven category of 11.4g/t gold, and with continued good results from ongoing
                                      drilling into the target high‑grade depth extensions of the ore body, we remain

regional exploration
the second pillar of centamin’s growth strategy is regional
exploration. seven other prospects besides sukari hill have
been identified on the 160km2 sukari tenement area and
exploration is being conducted under the principle that
ore from these prospects would be trucked to the existing
processing plant.




                                                                                                                                         strategic report
drilling programmes have been under way on the quartz
ridge and v‑shear prospects to the east and north‑east of
the hill respectively during 2013. ongoing drilling to the
south at the kurdeman prospect offers the potential to
fast‑track near surface high grade ore to supplement the
existing production. further regional drilling of the sukari
licence is planned for 2013.

exploration beyond sukari

sukari. centamin continued exploration on its four

tenements una deriam, finarwa, winibo and shehagne in
northern ethiopia, and in total, 11,134 meters were drilled
over the four tenements. of these licences only una deriam
remains active, the others having being impaired at the year
end due to the presence of only low grade mineralisation.

in september 2013 centamin entered into joint venture
with alecto minerals plc to pursue existing and new
opportunities identified by alecto in ethiopia. the initial
joint venture projects relate to two exploration licences
wayu boda and aysid meketel.

     financial review

     centamin delivered strong operational and financial
     results in 2013, producing 356,943 ounces of gold
     (2012: 262,828 ounces) and generating profit after tax for
     the year of us$184.0 million (including exceptional items)
     2012: us$199.0 million.
                                       the financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2013 are presented
                                       in accordance with the group’s accounting policies and based on international
                                       financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union (“eu ifrs”).

                                       through the group’s emphasis on maximising productivity and maintaining
                                       rigorous cost control, centamin has continued to return strong earnings and
                                       cash flow generation despite the weaker gold price environment. now in its
                                       fifth year of production, the sukari gold mine remains highly cash generative,
                                       with ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation)
                                       of us$234.2 million (including exceptional items) (2012: us$233.3 million),
                                       and a robust cash and cash equivalents balance of us$106.0 million
                                       (2012: us$147.1 million) as at 31 december 2013.

                                       revenue
                                       revenue from gold and silver sales has increased by 18% to us$503.8 million,
                                       as a result of a 43% increase in gold sold to 363,576 ounces offset by a 17%
                                       decrease in the average gold price to us$1,384 per ounce.

     chief financial officer           net profit
                                       the group recorded a net profit before tax for the year ended 31 december
                                       2013 of us$184.0 million (2012: us$198.6 million). the decrease is driven
                                       primarily by the lower gold price which was offset by higher volumes of gold sold
                                       and lower costs due to management’s rigorous cost control. included within this
                                       figure is the impairment of available-for-sale financial assets (us$12.9 million),
                                       impairment of associates (us$3.6 million) and impairment of exploration and
                                       evaluation assets (us$6.5 million).

                                       net cash flows
                                       net cash flows used in investing activities comprise exploration expenditure
                                       and capital development expenditures at sukari including the acquisition of
                                       financial and mineral assets. these cash flows have decreased year-on-year by
                                       us$39.0 million to us$282.8 million. the primary use of the funds during the
                                       year was for investment in capital work‑in‑progress in relation to the stage 4
                                       development and open pit mining fleet. in addition cash used in the purchase of
                                       available‑for‑sale financial assets was us$2.5 million, offset by proceeds received
                                       from the available‑for‑sale financial assets of us$0.8 million compared to an
                                       outflow of us$6.4 million in 2012.

     corporate social responsibility statement

     statement by the chairman of the health, safety, environment
     and sustainability committee, bob bowker



                                       dear shareholders

                                       i am presenting this report in my capacity as chairman of the hses committee,
                                       a committee of the board of centamin.

                                       at centamin we are committed to responsible mining. we realise that an
                                       ongoing commitment to sustainable development practices is critical to our
                                       business. guided by our company values, we are committed to meeting the
                                       highest standards of social responsibility by protecting the safety and health
                                       of our employees, by safeguarding the working environment and creating
                                       a long‑lasting positive impact on the communities in which we operate.
                                       we believe that this policy delivers longer term value for our shareholders.

                                       the health, safety, environment and sustainability committee has worked closely
                                       throughout the year with the management of the company to help achieve the
     bob bowker                        objectives set by the committee and management and aiming, where possible,
     chairman of the                   to exceed these high standards and targets. we have especially welcomed and
     hses committee                    supported the steps taken in 2013 to improve, still further, the excellent results
                                       achieved in regard to workplace safety.

                                       in 2013, the board approved a strategy for the pursuit of community social
                                       development initiatives and the hses committee receives regular reporting from
                                       management on social and environmental initiatives and projects.

                                       as the first modern mining company to operate in egypt, centamin is particularly
                                       conscious of the role it is playing in developing the expertise of egyptian
                                       nationals in the mining sector. we take a great deal of pride in the fact that
                                       our egyptian national employees are gaining skills and knowledge and taking
                                       advantage of opportunities for career progression and promotion.

                                       highlighted within the report is a case study on one of our highly valued
                                       supervisors, mr nagy abdou, who is one of a growing number of talented
                                       egyptians able to realise their potential and make a significant contribution to the
                                       growth and success of the company.

                                       throughout this report references to hses policies refer to the company’s health
                                       safety and environmental policy, the company’s corporate social responsibility
                                       policy and certain industry and operational policies in place at sukari.

                                       our efforts in this area are guided by the company’s hses policies that aim
                                       to ensure high standards of safety and wellbeing for the workforce. the hses
                                       policies outline our commitment to educating our employees and contractors
                                       to apply safe working standards which safeguard all employees and contractors
                                       and the workplace environment. the hses policies also help develop a
                                       sustainable business where our activities benefit the wider community and
                                       the company’s stakeholders.

our health programme has a special focus on food safety
and hygiene, given we have a large mess that provides
meals to about 1,500 employees and contractors per day.
in 2013, we implemented a programme to improve hygiene
in the kitchen and dining facilities. the programme included
periodic inspections and food testing as well as hygiene and
food preparation training.




                                                                                                                                  strategic report
health campaigns in 2013 included a “quit smoking”
campaign, personal hygiene and “fasting ramadan”
campaigns. within the campaigns we printed alerts on
the back of pay slips, displayed posters and other notices
around site as well as our doctor delivering toolbox talks
about the topic.

in 2013, the following audits were carried out and the
outcomes were as follows:

(1) internal environmental audits confirmed the results




                                                                                                                                  performance review
    were within acceptable limits;
(2) water quality testing carried out by an external
    laboratory confirmed no major anomalies;
(3) air quality audits conducted by cairo university
    recorded no anomalies and confirmed that sukari was
    compliant with required standards; and
(4) emissions were reported to be at safe levels, as
    required by egyptian law and international standards
    set by the world bank.

     management discussion & analysis and business review

     the following management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations (“md&a”) for
     centamin plc (the “company” or “centamin”) should be read in conjunction with the directors’ report and the audited
     consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2013 and related notes thereto, which statements were
     prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (“ifrs”) as adopted by the european union (“eu”).
     for more information see ‘basis of preparation’ in note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year
     ended 31 december 2013. the effective date of this report is 21 march 2014.

     for further information relating to the company, including information about mineral resources and reserves, reference
     should be made to its public filings (including its most recently filed aif) which are available on sedar at www.sedar.com.
     information is also available on the company’s website at www.centamin.com. all amounts in this md&a are expressed in
     united states dollars unless otherwise identified.

     overview
     centamin is a mineral exploration, development and mining company that has been active in egypt since 1995.
     the company’s principal asset is the sukari gold mine, which is located in the eastern desert approximately 900km from
     cairo and 25km from the red sea. first gold was poured at sukari on 26 june 2009, and was followed by four successive
     years of growth, from approximately 150,000 ounces in 2010 to c.357,000oz in 2013. the doubling of plant throughput
     to a nameplate rate of 10 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) will see another significant step‑up in 2014 as sukari heads
     towards the long‑term target production rate of 450‑500,000 ounces per annum from 2015. exploration at sukari hill and
     over the rest of the sukari concession area is continuing, with further significant resource and reserve growth expected,
     particularly from the high grade underground mine areas.

     centamin’s management team and board of directors have considerable expertise in the gold mining industry. this ranges
     from the early stage identification of deposits, project financing, construction and development, to the operating of large
     mines. some of the leadership team has been based at sukari for almost a decade, taking it from an early stage exploration
     project to the operating gold mine it is today.

     centamin’s operating experience gives it a significant advantage in acquiring and developing other gold projects.
     in 2013 centamin agreed a recommended takeover offer for asx‑listed ampella mining ltd and formed a joint venture
     with aim‑listed alecto minerals plc, adding highly prospective licence packages in burkina faso and ethiopia respectively.

     accounting for sukari gold mines
     the operating company of sukari, sukari gold mines (“sgm”), is jointly owned by pharaoh gold mines nl (“pgm”)
     and the egyptian mineral resource authority (“emra”) on a 50% equal basis. for accounting purposes, sgm is 100%
     proportional consolidated within the centamin group of companies reflecting the substance and economic reality of the
     concession. pursuant to the concession agreement, the provisions of which are described more fully below, pgm solely
     funds sgm’s activities. pgm is also entitled to recover the following costs and expenses payable from sales revenue
     (excluding the royalty payable to the arab republic of egypt (“are”) (i) all current operating expenses incurred and
     paid after the initial commercial production; (ii) exploration costs, including those accumulated to the commencement
     of commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum); and (iii) exploitation capital
     costs, including those accumulated prior to the commencement of commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of
     total accumulated cost per annum). legal title of all operating assets of pgm will pass to emra when cost recovery is
     completed. the right of use of all fixed and movable assets remains with pgm and sgm.

     since the commencement of commercial production on 1 april 2010, the cash flows generated by sgm through the sale of
     gold are used to fund the ongoing operating expenses incurred in its own right and to fund the cost recovery due to pgm
     for exploration and exploitation capital costs at a rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum.

     in return, ongoing capital expenditure incurred in connection with the sukari mine is funded solely by pgm out of cash flows
     received from sgm through the cost recovery process as described above. the expenditure incurred by pgm in relation to
     stage 4 will become recoverable once the infrastructure has been commissioned, which is currently planned at the end of
     2013, at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum. legal title of all operating assets of pgm will pass to emra
     when cost recovery is completed. the right of use of all fixed and movable assets remains with pgm and sgm.

     emra is entitled to a share of sgm’s net production surplus “profit share” (defined as revenue less payment of the 3%
     production royalty to are and recoverable costs). based on the company’s calculation there was no net profit share due to
     emra as at 30 june 2013, nor is any likely to be due as at 30 june 2014. it is expected that there will be a net production
     surplus (revenue in excess of production royalty and cost recoveries) available for sharing between emra and pgm for
     the sgm financial year ending 30 june 2015 (sgm’s accounting period is 1 july to 30 june) based on current gold prices,
     production forecasts and operating expenses. any disruption to operations or reduction in gold price realised will delay this
     profit sharing. this expected profit sharing takes into account the costs incurred on paying for fuel at international prices.

                                                                                            centamin plc annual report 2013    31




                                                                                                                                    introduction
any recovery of these prepayments, discussed in note 20 to the financial statements, will result in further amounts to be
shared between emra and pgm. any payment made to emra pursuant to these provisions of the concession agreement
will be recognised as a variable charge to the income statement of centamin, which will lead to a reduction in the earnings
per share. separate accounts are prepared in respect of sgm. these are independently audited and certified by egyptian
certified accountants approved by emra. any expected profit share payable to emra and pgm becomes payable on
completion of the audit of the sgm accounts. centamin will be working together with emra to ensure that these can be
approved as soon as possible so that the profit share can be paid to emra and pgm. centamin is looking forward to paying
the first profit share to emra. with a view to demonstrating goodwill toward the egyptian government, pgm has made




                                                                                                                                    strategic report
advance payments to emra which will be netted off against any future profit share that becomes payable to emra.

highlights for the year (1) (2) (3)
centamin delivered strong operational and financial results in 2013, producing 356,943 ounces of gold (2012: 262,828
ounces) and generating profit after tax for the year of us$184.0 million (2012: us$199.0 million). centamin has continued
to return strong earnings and cash flow generation despite the weaker gold price environment, owing to the group’s
emphasis on maximising productivity and maintaining rigorous cost control. now in its fifth year of production, the sukari
gold mine remains highly cash generative, with ebitda of us$234.2 million (2012: us$233.3 million). centamin has a
robust cash and cash equivalents balance of us$106.0 million (2012: us$147.1 million) as at 31 december 2013.

2013 saw the sukari operation performing well across all areas. most notably, the processing plant operated consistently




                                                                                                                                    performance review
at c.15% above nameplate capacity and the output from the underground mine continued to rise quarter‑on‑quarter to end
the year at levels significantly above original expectations. the completion of construction of the stage 4 plant expansion,
which is currently under commissioning, sets the stage for the next step‑up in production towards sukari’s long‑term target
of 450‑500,000 ounces per annum from 2015 onwards.

an updated resource and reserve statement for sukari was announced on 18 december 2013, with the total measured
and indicated resource containing 13.4 million ounces (“moz”) and the total reserve containing 8.2moz. the underground
reserve of 2.30 million tonnes (“mt”) represented a 120% increase on the december 2011 reserve, despite mining
depletion. we remain confident of further significant reserve expansion, with the 0.52mt proven component of
this reserve showing a grade of 11.4g/t gold, and continued positive results from ongoing drilling into the target
high‑grade extensions.




                                                                                                                                    management discussion
the company progressed its medium and long‑term growth strategy during 2013. in september, centamin entered into a
joint venture with aim‑listed alecto minerals plc over their exploration projects in ethiopia, thus expanding the company’s
presence in this important region of focus. a recommended all‑share takeover offer for asx‑listed ampella mining ltd,
valued at a$40.9 million, was announced on 10 december 2013. this takeover provides centamin with an extensive
licence holding over a highly prospective and underexplored 100km+ trend of gold mineralisation in burkina faso.
centamin will implement a systematic exploration programme, aimed at developing the potential for further substantial
growth of the existing resource base comprising 1.92moz indicated and 1.33moz inferred.

centamin remains in a robust position to continue delivering on its track record of production growth and solid cash flow
generation during 2014 and beyond, as shown by the following:                                                                       governance

• basic earnings per share 16.87 cents, down 8% on prior year;
• record ebitda us$234.2 million, up 1% on the prior year;
• full year production was 356,943, a 36% increase on 2012 and above guidance of 320,000 ounces;
• cash costs of production of us$663 per ounce;
• stage 4 plant expansion (to nameplate capacity of 10mtpa) expenditure at the year end was us$327.8 million of the
  reforecast cost of us$331.2 million, including contingency;
• centamin remains debt‑free and unhedged with cash, bullion on hand, gold sales receivable and available‑for‑sale
  financial assets of us$142.5 million as at 31 december 2013; and
                                                                                                                                    financial statements




• the supreme administrative court appeal and diesel fuel oil (“dfo”) court case are both ongoing. both of these
  cases are described in detail elsewhere in this md&a (refer to the section headed “egyptian court litigation” below).
  operations continue as normal and any enforcement of the administrative court decision has been suspended pending
  the appeal ruling. we remain confident that a satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved in both cases.

with respect to the dfo case, management recognises the practical difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from
the government and, for this reason, has fully provided against the cumulative prepayment of us$97.0 million as an
exceptional item (refer to note 6 to the financial statements). in the meantime the group is continuing to pay international
prices for dfo.

     (1) cash cost of production, ebitda and cash, bullion on hand and available‑for‑sale financial assets are non‑gaap measures. for further
         information and a detailed reconciliation, please see ”non‑gaap financial measures” section below.
     (2) basic eps, ebitda, cash costs of production reported includes an exceptional provision against prepayments to reflect the removal
         of fuel subsidies which occurred in january 2012 (refer to note 6 to the financial statements for further details). the provision had no
         further impact on the 2012 results other than previously reported.
     (3) the report contains certain forward‑looking statements and attention is drawn to the cautionary statement that appears at the front of
         this document.

centamin produced 356,943 ounces of gold in 2013, which is a 36% increase on 262,828 ounces in 2012. the higher
year‑on‑year production was a result of: (a) a 26% increase in tonnes milled (to 5.7mt) due to the improved plant
productivity and availability, (b) an 50% increase in production from the underground due to improved underground mining
contractor equipment availability, and (c) a 4% higher feed grade to the mills (2.12g/t in 2013 compared to 2.04g/t in 2012)
as underground productivity and head grades increased.

open pit
the open pit delivered total material movement of 41,718kt for the year, an increase of 66% on the prior year. the increase




                                                                                                                                    strategic report
in total material movement was related to increase in the mining fleet capacity during the year. additional mining
equipment will continue to be delivered during the first half of 2014.

as part of the implementation of stage 4, the company is in discussions with emra and other government departments in
relation to increasing the daily usage of ammonium nitrate (“an”) in order to increase open pit mining rates to the required
level to feed the expanded plant. the increase in the daily issue of an is still outstanding and this has had an impact on
the movement of waste material compared to the current mining plan. however from recent meetings with the relevant
authorities, management believe government approval is now in its final stages.

ore production from the open pit was 11.7mt at 0.81g/t with an average head grade fed to the plant of 1.25g/t. the rom
ore stockpile balance increased by 1kt to 1.8kt by the end of the year. mining was primarily from the stage 3 area, in the

stage 2 area mining continued to the 950rl and development work progressed in the gazelle and eastern hills area to
the 1100rl.

underground mine
ore production from the underground mine was 587kt. the ratio of ore from stoping versus development remained
consistent year on year, with 52% of development ore (304kt) and 48% of stoping ore (283kt). ore production from stoping
and development was in line with forecasts. development and stoping requirements were increased in the second half
of 2013.

a total of 11,620 metres of diamond drilling was completed for both short‑term stope definition and underground resource
development. during the year 3,786m of development were driven through ore. the project development total to date is




                                                                                                                                    management discussion
15,766m, of which 9,200m were through ore.

as part of the development of the ptah area, the first crosscut to access the 845, 860, 875 and 890 levels has been
completed. three exploration drill cubbies have been established where drilling is actively taking place ore drives have
been developed on the ptah 875 level and the exhaust system was extended to the 875 level crosscut.

processing
the annual throughput in the sukari plant was 5.7mt in 2013, a 27% increase on 2012 (4.5mt). productivity of the
processing plant averaged 700tph for the year, 12% above the nameplate design rate of 625tph, as the operations team
continued to optimise availability and throughput.

plant metallurgical recoveries were 88.6% in the year, a 2.6% increase on 2012. continued optimisation of operational               governance
controls and improved circuit stability resulted in the recovery steadily increasing throughout the year. whilst operational
improvements are being made, recoveries are expected to remain consistent until the new carbon regeneration kiln is
commissioned in 2014.

the dump leach operation produced 12,382oz in 2013, an 85% increase from 2012.

exploration update
sukari hill
centamin has resources (as of 30 july 2013) of 13.4 million ounces measured and indicated, and 1.9 million ounces
inferred, and reserves (as of 30 september 2013) of 8.2 million ounces. underground drilling continued to be stepped‑up
during the year as new development provided improved access from below surface to test potential high grade extensions
of the deposit. underground drilling is utilising 4 longyear lm90 rigs. these rigs have been located in the ptah decline,
drilling east through both the eastern and the western contact of the porphyry and in the amun area, drilling outwards east
and west from the within the porphyry. the ore body has neither yet been closed off by drilling to the north, nor at depth.




                                                                                                                                                      strategic report
further exploration of the sukari deposit will take place during 2014, predominantly from positions within the porphyry in
both the amun and ptah areas.

regional exploration
reverse circulation and diamond drilling programmes have been under way on the quartz ridge, v‑shear and kurdeman
prospects to the east, north‑east and south of the hill respectively during 2013. ongoing drilling to the south at the
kurdeman prospect offers the potential to fast‑track near surface high grade ore to supplement the existing production.
further regional drilling of the sukari licence is planned for 2014.

growth beyond sukari

                                                                                                                                                      performance review
low grade mineralisation.

in september 2013 centamin entered into joint venture with alecto minerals plc to pursue existing and new opportunities
identified by alecto in ethiopia. the initial joint venture projects relate to two exploration licences wayu boda and aysid
meketel where exploration activities have now commenced.

a recommended all‑share takeover offer for asx‑listed ampella mining ltd, was announced on 10 december 2013.
this takeover provides centamin with an extensive licence holding over a highly prospective and underexplored +100km
trend of gold mineralisation in burkina faso, as well as further exploration properties in côte d’ivoire. centamin will
implement a systematic exploration program, aimed at developing the outstanding potential for further significant growth
of the existing resource base, comprising 1.92moz indicated and 1.33moz inferred.

     the group recorded net profit before tax for the year ended 31 december 2013 of us$184.0 million
     (2012: us$198.6 million). the decrease is driven primarily by the lower gold price which was offset by higher
     volumes of gold sold and lower costs due to management’s rigorous cost control.

     (f) us$19.0 million in advance payments made toward emra, demonstrating goodwill towards the egyptian government,
         and such advance payments will be netted off against any future profit share that becomes payable. refer to the
         accounting for sukari gold mines section above for further details; and
     (g) a us$253.8 million increase in property, plant and equipment, mainly relating to net capitalised work‑in‑progress costs
         of us$252.2 million (comprising us$99.3 million for the stage 4 processing plant, us$77.4 million for the open pit
         mining fleet expansion, us$16.2 million for open pit development, us$29.5 million for underground development,
         us$1.7 million for mine development properties and us$28.1 million for other sustaining capital expenditure); offset by
     (h) a depreciation and amortisation charge of us$50.9 million.

     current liabilities have increased by us$18.7 million to us$78.2 million as a result of the addition to the open pit
     mining fleet.

     non‑current liabilities reported during the period have increased by us$2.1 million as a result of:

     (a) a change in estimate of the future rehabilitation costs; and
     (b) the unwinding of the discount on the provision for rehabilitation.

     there has been no movement in issued capital.

     reserves reported have increased by us$2.3 million to us$5.7 million as result of the recognition of the share-based
     payments expense.

     accumulated profits increased by us$190.7 million as a result of the increase in the profit for the year attributable to the
     shareholders of the company of us$184.0 million together with a us$6.8 million gain on available‑for‑sale financial assets as a
     result of the cumulative loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income being reclassified from equity to profit.

     current ratio is calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities. the decrease in the current ratio is a result
     of the increase in current liabilities driven by the rise in supply relating to higher production at the sukari gold mine and an
     increase in the payables in relation to the open pit mining fleet.

     the return on equity ratio is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of the company
     for the period by total shareholders’ equity and measures the return on ownership. the return on equity ratio showed a
     decrease from 20 for 2012 to 16 for 2013 as a result of the increase in the shareholders equity.

    removal of fuel subsidies which occurred in january 2012 (refer to note 6 to the financial statements for further details).

the company’s results over the past several quarters have been driven primarily by fluctuations in gold price and
increases in gold equivalent ounces produced. additionally, increases in input costs and foreign exchange rates have
impacted results.

during the fourth quarter of 2013, revenue increased to us$111.2 million on gold equivalent ounces sold of 88,856
compared with revenue of us$138.5 million on sales of 82,316 gold equivalent ounces during the fourth quarter of 2012.
the average realised gold price per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2012 was us$1,697 compared with the average realised                           governance
gold price during this quarter of us$1,384 per ounce.

cost of sales decreased by 9% to us$72.4 million in the final quarter of 2013 versus us$79.5 million in the prior year,
and although there were underlying increased costs in the mining area and processing area as a result of increased
activity quarter on quarter with tonnes moved increasing by 43% and tonnes treated by 14%, q4 2012 included the full
exceptional provision against prepayments to reflect the removal of the fuel subsidy which occurred in january 2012.

liquidity and capital resources
at 31 december 2013, the group had cash and cash equivalents of us$106.0 million compared to us$147.1 million at
31 december 2012. the majority of funds have been invested in international rolling short‑term higher interest money
market deposits. the decrease in cash position is primarily due to the payments in relation to the stage 4 processing plant
                                                                                                                                                  financial statements

reflect the removal of fuel subsidies offset with increased production.

centamin has a strong and flexible financial position with no debt, no hedging and cash and cash equivalents, bullion
on hand, gold sales receivables and available‑for‑sale financial assets of us$142.5 million at 31 december 2013.
cash and cash equivalents, bullion on hand, gold sales receivables and available‑for‑sale financial assets is a non‑gaap
financial measure.

     management discussion & analysis and business review
     continued
     liquidity and capital resources continued
     liquidity risk is the risk associated with not having access to sufficient funds to meet planned and unplanned cash
     requirements. centamin manages its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating and strategic liquidity levels
     are well above minimum company requirements.

     trade and other payables increased from us$54.6 million to us$78.1 million reflecting the amounts owed for mining
     equipment, which were needed to move the additional material, in readiness for stage 4.

     in the day-to-day business, the group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital
     expenditure requirements. the cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise returns while ensuring that
     capital is safeguarded to the maximum extent possible by investing only with financial institutions with a strong credit rating.

     the group’s primary source of liquidity is operating cash flow. the principal risk factor affecting operating cash flow is cost,
     gold prices, timing of gold sales and the legal actions in relation to the concession agreement and subsidy for diesel fuel oil.

     the group’s financial commitments are limited to planned and discretionary spending on work programmes at the sukari
     gold mine, planned and discretionary spending on work programmes at the exploration licences owned by sheba,
     administration expenditure at the egyptian, australian, jersey and ethiopian office locations and for general working
     capital purposes.

     management considers that the group has adequate current assets and forecast cash flow from operations to manage
     liquidity risks arising from settlement of current liabilities and non‑current liabilities.

     we had no debt for both the 2013 and the 2012 period.

     segment disclosure
     the group is engaged in the business of exploration and production of precious metals only, which is characterised as one
     business segment only. see note 8 to the financial statements.

     significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments
     in the application of the group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3 to the financial statements,
     management is required to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions about carrying values of assets and liabilities that
     are not readily apparent from other sources. the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience
     and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of
     making the judgments. actual results may differ from these estimates.

     the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. revisions to accounting estimates are
     recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the
     revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

     the following are the critical judgments that management has made in the process of applying the group’s accounting
     policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:

     litigation
     the group is currently a party to two legal actions both of which could, affect its ability to operate the mine at sukari in
     the manner in which it is currently operated and adversely affect its profitability. the details of this litigation, which relate
     to the loss of the egyptian national subsidy for diesel fuel oil and the ability of the group to operate outside the area of
     3km2 determined by the administrative court of first instance to be the area of the sukari exploitation lease, are available
     in note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed annual information form (“aif”) which is available
     on sedar at www.sedar.com. although it is possible to quantify the effects of the loss the national fuel subsidy, it is not
     currently possible to quantify with sufficient precision the effect of restricting operations to an area of 3km2.

                                                                                                centamin plc annual report 2013     41




                                                                                                                                         introduction
every action is being taken to contest these decisions, including the making of formal legal appeals and, although their
resolution may take some time, management remains confident that a satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved.
in the meantime, however, the group is continuing to pay international prices for diesel fuel oil. with respect to the
administrative court ruling, on 20 march 2013 the supreme administrative court upheld the company’s application to
suspend this decision until the merits of the company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus providing assurance that
normal operations would be able to continue during this process.

recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation and development expenditure




                                                                                                                                         strategic report
the group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in exploration and evaluation expenditure
being capitalised for those projects where such expenditure is considered likely to be recoverable through future extraction
activity or sale or where the exploration activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the
existence of reserves. this policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and
circumstances, in particular whether the group will proceed with development based on existence of reserves or whether
an economically viable extraction operation can be established. such estimates and assumptions may change from period
to period as new information becomes available. if, subsequent to the exploration and evaluation expenditure being
capitalised, a judgment is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely or the project is to be abandoned, the relevant
capitalised amount will be written off to the income statement.

accounting treatment of sukari gold mines (“sgm”)




                                                                                                                                         performance review
sgm is wholly consolidated within the centamin group of companies, reflecting the substance and economic reality of the
concession agreement (see note 23 to the financial statements).

the following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year:

provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs
the group is required to decommission, rehabilitate and restore mines and processing sites at the end of their producing
lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities. the provision has been calculated taking into account the
estimated future obligations including the costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration and monitoring of




                                                                                                                                         management discussion
the affected areas. the provision for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure
required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date.

ore reserve estimates
estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include assumptions on commodity prices, exchange rates, discount
rates and production costs for future cash flows. it also involves assessment and judgment of difficult geological models.
the economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate ore reserves may change from period to period. changes
in ore reserves affect the carrying values of mine properties, property, plant and equipment, provision for rehabilitation
assets and deferred taxes. ore reserves are integral to the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged to the
statement of comprehensive income and the calculation of inventory.
                                                                                                                                         governance
production forecasts from the underground mine at sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future resource and
reserve growth. it is the opinion of management and directors that these estimates are both realistic and conservative,
based on current information. however, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for
further reserve definition, the life of this part of the mine remains limited and there is a risk that some or all of this growth
will not materialise with a consequent negative impact on current production forecasts which affect the unit of production
used in depreciation calculations.

depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs
depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs at the sukari mine is based on reserve estimates.
management and directors believe that these estimates are both realistic and conservative, based on current information.
however, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for further reserve definition,
                                                                                                                                         financial statements




the estimated reserves may change with a consequent negative impact on the carrying value of capitalised underground
mine development.

depreciation of the sukari plant
sukari plant, capitalised within plant and equipment, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 45 year economic life.
when determining the useful economic life of the plant, management has assumed that its exploration activities will lead
to future reserves increases at the sukari mine site which will extend its life beyond the current life of mine, which is 2029
based on current reserves. management have the option to extend the concession agreement by 30 years beyond its
current expiry date of 2035.

     management discussion & analysis and business review
     continued
     accounting policies
     the group adopted ifrs 13 fair value measurement. refer to note 3 to the financial statements for further details.
     there have been no further changes to the group’s accounting policies during the year.

     going concern statement
     the group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position
     are set out in this business review. the financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing
     facilities are also described in this business review above. in addition, note 26 to the financial statements includes the
     group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its
     financial instruments; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.

     as highlighted in note 26 to the financial statements, the group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through
     cash generated by its operations. the current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over (a) the level of
     demand of the group’s products; (b) the price at which its products can be sold; and (c) the price at which its main raw
     materials can be procured.

     the group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that
     the group should be able to continue generating sufficient cash in order to finance its operations and capital expansions.

     during the year the operation of the mine was affected by two legal actions. the first of these followed from a decision
     taken by egpc to charge international, not local (subsidised) prices for the supply of diesel fuel oil, and the second arose
     as a result of judgment of an administrative court of first instance in relation to, amongst other matters, the company’s
     160km2 exploitation lease. in relation to the first decision, the company remains confident that in the event that it is
     required to continue to pay international prices, the mine at sukari will remain commercially viable. similarly, the company
     remains confident that the appeal it has lodged in relation to the decision of the administrative court will ultimately be
     successful, although final resolution of it may take some time. on 20 march 2013 the supreme administrative court upheld
     the company’s application to suspend the decision until the merits of the company’s appeal are considered and ruled on,
     thus providing assurance that normal operations would be able to continue during this process. a detailed summary of the
     litigation is available at note 20 to the financial statements.

     in the unlikely event that the group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are
     restricted to a reduced area, it is the directors’ belief that the group will be able to continue as a going concern.

     the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will have adequate resources to continue in operational
     existence for the foreseeable future. thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the
     financial statements.

     non‑gaap financial measures
     three non‑gaap financial measures are used in this report:

     (1) ebitda: “ebitda” is a non‑gaap financial measure, which excludes the following from profit before tax:

        • finance costs;
        • finance income; and
        • depreciation and amortisation.

        management believes that ebitda is a valuable indicator of the group’s ability to generate liquidity by producing
        operating cash flow to fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures. ebitda is also frequently used by
        investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby ebitda is multiplied by a factor or “ebitda multiple” that is
        based on an observed or inferred relationship between ebitda and market values to determine the approximate total
        enterprise value of a company. ebitda is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and
        does not have any standardised definition under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
        measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs. ebitda excludes the impact of cash costs and income
        of financing activities and taxes, and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from
        operations as determined under ifrs. other companies may calculate ebitda differently. the following table provides
        a reconciliation of ebitda to profit for the year attributable to the company.

(2) cash cost per ounce calculation: “cash costs per ounce” is a non‑gaap financial measure. cash cost per ounce
    is a measure of the average cost of producing an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing the operating costs in a
    period by the total gold production over the same period. operating costs represent total operating costs less
    administrative expenses, royalties, depreciation and amortisation. management uses this measure internally to better
    assess performance trends for the company as a whole. the company believes that, in addition to conventional

    measures prepared in accordance with gaap, certain investors use such non‑gaap information to evaluate the
    company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. the company believes that these measures provide an
    alternative reflection of the group’s performance for the current period and are an alternative indication of its expected
    performance in future periods. cash costs is intended to provide additional information, does not have any standardised
    meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
    prepared in accordance with gaap. this measure is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from
    operations as determined under gaap. other companies may calculate these measures differently.

     internal controls
     financial reporting controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is
     gathered and reported to management, including the ceo, cfo and coo, on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions
     can be made regarding public disclosure. management, with the participation of the certifying officers, has evaluated the
     effectiveness of the design and operation, as of 31 december 2013, of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures
     (as defined by the canadian securities administrators). based on that evaluation, the certifying officers have concluded
     that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that material information relating to the
     company and its subsidiaries is made known to them by others within those entities.

     internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
     financial reporting and compliance with generally accepted accounting principles in our financial statements. management
     evaluated at implementation the design of internal controls over financial reporting and has concluded that such internal
     controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
     and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with international financial reporting
     standards (“ifrs”) adopted by the european union (“eu ifrs”). in addition, there have been no changes in the company’s
     internal control over financial reporting during the year ended 31 december 2013 that have materially affected, or are
     reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

     financial instruments
     at 31 december 2013, the group has exposure to interest rate risk which is limited to the floating market rate for cash.

     the group does not have foreign currency risk for non‑monetary assets and liabilities of the egyptian operations as these
     are deemed to have a functional currency of united states dollars. the group has no significant monetary foreign currency
     assets and liabilities apart from australian dollar and united states dollar cash term deposits.

     the group currently does not engage in any hedging or derivative transactions to manage interest rate or foreign
     currency risks.

     foreign investment in egypt
     foreign investments in the petroleum and mining sectors in egypt are governed by individual production sharing
     agreements (concession agreements) between foreign companies and the ministry for petroleum and mineral resources
     or the egyptian mineral resource authority (“emra”) (as the case may be) and are individual acts of parliament.

     title, exploitation and development rights to the sukari gold mine are granted under the terms of the concession
     agreement promulgated as law no. 222 of 1994, signed on 29 january 1995 and effective from 13 june 1995.
     the concession agreement was issued by way of presidential decree after the approval of the people’s assembly in
     accordance with the egyptian constitution and law no. 61 of 1958. the concession agreement was issued in accordance
     with the egyptian mines and quarries law no. 86 of 1956 which allows for the ministry to grant the right to parties to
     explore and mine for minerals in egypt.

     whilst the company is the first foreign company to develop a modern large‑scale gold mine in egypt there is significant
     foreign investment in the petroleum sector. several large multinational oil and gas companies operate successfully in
     egypt, some of which have long histories in the country and have dedicated significant amounts of capital. the company
     believes that the successful track record of foreign investment established by these companies in the petroleum sector is
     an important indication of the ability of foreign companies to attract financing and receive development approvals for the
     construction of major mining projects in egypt.

     egyptian court litigation
     as discussed elsewhere in this document the company was involved in two separate actions. the first followed from a
     decision taken by egpc to charge international, not local prices (subsidised), prices for the supply of diesel fuel oil, and
     the second arose as a result of judgment of an administrative court of first instance in cairo in relation to the company’s
     160km2 exploitation lease.

     concession agreement court case
     on 30 october 2012, the administrative court in egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by,
     amongst others, an independent member of the previous parliament, in which he argued for the nullification of the
     agreement that confers on the group rights to operate in egypt. this agreement, the concession agreement, was
     entered into between the arab republic of egypt, the egyptian mineral resources authority (“emra”) and centamin’s
     wholly-owned subsidiary pharaoh gold mines (“pgm”), and was approved by the people’s assembly as law 222 of 1994.

                                                                                               centamin plc annual report 2013     45




                                                                                                                                        introduction
in summary that judgment states that, although the concession agreement itself remains valid and in force, insufficient
evidence had been submitted to court in order to demonstrate that the 160km2 “exploitation lease” between pgm
and emra had received approval from the relevant minister as required by the terms of the concession agreement.
accordingly, the court found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 160km2 was not valid although it stated
that there was in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km2. centamin, however, is in possession of the executed
original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 160km2 exploitation lease was approved by the minister of
petroleum and mineral resources. it appears that an executed original document was not supplied to the court.




                                                                                                                                        strategic report
upon notification of the judgment the group took various steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine
at sukari. these included lodging a formal appeal before the supreme administrative court on 26 november 2012.
in addition, in conjunction with the formal appeal the group applied to the supreme administrative court to suspend the
initial decision until such time as the court is able to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. on 20 march 2013 the
court upheld this application thus suspending the initial decision and providing assurance that normal operations will be
able to continue whilst the appeal process is under way.

emra lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 27 november 2012, the day after the company’s appeal was
lodged. furthermore, in late december 2012, the minister of petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and shortly thereafter
publicly indicated that, in his view, the terms of the concession agreement were fair and that the exploitation lease was
valid. the minister of petroleum also expressed support for the investment and expertise that centamin brings to the




                                                                                                                                        performance review
country. the company believes this demonstrates the government’s commitment to our investment at sukari and the
desire to stimulate further investment in the egyptian mining industry.

the company does not yet know when the appeal will conclude, although it is aware of the potential for the process
in egypt to be lengthy. the company has taken extensive legal advice on the merits of its appeal from two leading
egyptian law firms who have confirmed that the proper steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km2
exploitation lease. the company therefore remains of the view that the appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will
ultimately be successful.

in the event that the appellate court fails to be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the group,
the operations at sukari may be adversely effected to the extent that the group’s operation exceeds the exploitation




                                                                                                                                        management discussion
lease area of 3km2 referred to in the original court decision.

the company remains confident that normal operations at sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal process is under way.
centamin does not currently see the need to take the matter to a court outside of egypt as centamin remains of the belief
that the egyptian court will rule in centamin’s favour.

further details about this litigation are set out in note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed annual
information form (“aif”) which is available on sedar at www.sedar.com.

diesel fuel court case
in january 2012 the group received a letter from chevron to the effect that chevron would not be able to continue
supplying diesel fuel oil (“dfo”) to the mine at sukari at local subsidised prices, thereby adding approximately                        governance
us$150 per ounce to the cost of production. it is understood that the reason that this letter was issued was that chevron
had received a letter instructing it to do so from the egyptian general petroleum corporation (“egpc”). subsequent to
this first letter, the group received a demand from egyptian general petroleum corporation (“egpc”) for le403 million
(us$60 million) being the amount of the subsidy received in respect of the diesel fuel supplied from december 2009
until january 2012.

the group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter and in consequence in june lodged an appeal against egpc’s
decision in the administrative courts. again, the group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is
good prospect of success. however, as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the continuation of supply, the group has
since january advanced funds to our fuel supplier, chevron, based on the international price for fuel. further details about
this litigation are set out in note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed aif which will be available on
                                                                                                                                        financial statements

     management discussion & analysis and business review
     continued
     overview of sukari concession agreement
     pharaoh gold mines nl (“pgm”) a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, egsma (now “emra”) and the arab
     republic of egypt (“are”) entered into the concession agreement dated 29 january 1995, granting pgm and emra the
     right to explore, develop, mine and sell gold and associated minerals in specific concession areas located in the eastern
     desert of egypt identified in the concession agreement. the concession agreement came into effect under egyptian law
     on 13 june 1995.

     a summary of the main terms of the concession agreement is as follows:

     • pgm provides funding to the operating company, sukari gold mining company, (“sgm”) and is responsible for the
       day‑to‑day management of that company;
     • pgm is entitled to recover:
        • all current operating expenses incurred and paid after the initial commercial production;
        •  exploration costs, including those accumulated to the commencement of commercial production (at the rate of
            33.3% per annum); and
        •  exploitation capital costs, including those accumulated prior to the commencement of commercial production (at the
            rate of 33.3% per annum).
     • the are is entitled to a royalty of 3% of net sales revenue from the sale of gold and associated minerals from the sukari
       gold mine;
     • commencing on the date of commercial production, sgm and pgm is entitled to a 15 year exemption from any taxes
       imposed by the egyptian government, with an option to file an application to extend this entitlement for a further
       15 years;
     • after the deduction of recoverable expenses and the payment of the 3% royalty, the profits are shared equally between
       pgm and emra (with an additional 10% of proceeds paid to pgm in the first two years that there are net proceeds and
       an additional 5% in the following two years);
     • pgm, emra and the operating company are exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect to the importation of
       machinery, equipment and consumable items required for the purpose of exploration and mining activities at sukari;
     • pgm, emra, the operating company and their respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export
       of gold and associated minerals produced from the sukari gold mine; and
     • legal title of all operating assets of pgm will pass to emra when cost recovery is completed. the right of use of all fixed
       and movable assets remains with pgm and sgm.

     in addition, the concession agreement establishes a procedure for the conversion of any exploration lease granted
     in favour of pgm into an exploitation lease. upon following the procedure prescribed by the concession agreement,
     the company was granted such an exploitation lease in respect of 160km2 in 2005 and is in possession of the original
     document granting this lease duly signed by all relevant parties. the validity of this lease is, however, the subject of the
     litigation referred to above.

     for the accounting treatment of the concession agreement refer to note 23 to the financial statements.

     principal risks affecting the centamin group
     the exploration for and development of metals and mineral resources, together with the construction and development
     of mining operations is a speculative activity that involves a high degree of risk.

     centamin conducts a variety of risk assessments throughout the year, which are reviewed by the audit and risk committee
     and the board in accordance with best practice guidelines and in compliance with the uk corporate governance code
     and relevant canadian requirements.

     centamin takes a number of measures to mitigate risks associated with its underlying operational and exploration activity
     which are monitored and evaluated regularly. due to the nature of these inherent risks, it is not possible to give absolute
     assurance that mitigating actions will be wholly effective.

     the table below describes the key risks affecting centamin and its operational and exploration activities together with the
     measures to mitigate risk and the preserved risk by management.

sukari project joint   sgm is owned jointly by pgm and emra, with equal board representation, whilst responsibility for the day‑to‑day
venture risk and       management of sgm rests with the general manager, who is appointed by pgm. the board of sgm operates by
relationship with      way of simple majority. as such, should the board of sgm be unable to reach consensus on a matter requiring
emra                   board‑level approval or in the event of any dispute arising between pgm and emra, which pgm is unable to
                       amicably resolve, it may have to participate in arbitration or other proceedings to resolve the dispute, which
                       could have a material and adverse effect on centamin’s business, results of operations, financial performance
                       and prospects.
                       any dispute with emra may adversely affect centamin’s ability to manage the sukari project in the most
                       effective way. such a dispute could arise under the cost recovery and profit share provisions of the sukari
                       concession agreement.
                       the successful management of the sukari gold mine is in part dependent on maintaining a good working

                       relationship with emra. the group has regular meetings with officials from emra and invests time in liaising
                       with relevant ministry and other governmental representatives. management and the board of directors believe
                       the group has a positive and constructive working relationship with emra. the group complies with all terms
                       and conditions of the concession agreement covering the sukari gold mine. emra has equal representation on
                       the board of sukari gold mines and is involved to that extent in approving and auditing all work programs and
                       expenditures. emra inspectors are closely involved in monitoring all aspects of the sukari operations. current
                       discussions with emra are focused on determining the exact timing and quantum of the first payment of profit
                       sharing for sukari. whilst the impact would be high, management believes there is a low probability of a material
                       deterioration in relationships with emra, particularly following the prepayment in relation to future profit share
                       made during the year.
                       mitigating factors also include ensuring co‑operative relations with emra however the risk identified above
                       remains moderate.

failure to achieve     centamin currently prepares estimates of future gold production for its existing and future development of the
production             sukari gold mine. there can be no assurance that centamin will achieve its production estimates and such failure
estimates              could have a material and adverse effect on centamin’s future cash flows, profitability, results of operations
                       and financial condition. the realisation of production estimates are dependent on, amongst other things: the
                       accuracy of mineral reserve and resource estimates; the accuracy of assumptions regarding ore grades and
                       recovery rates; ground conditions (including hydrology); physical characteristics of ores; the presence or absence
                       of particular metallurgical characteristics; the accuracy of estimated rates and costs of mining (including access
                       to and permitting for sufficient quantities of ammonium nitrate and related blasting products), ore haulage,
                       the availability of suitable machinery and equipment, skilled labour and processing capacity and all logistics for
                       consumables and parts.
                       whilst there can be no certainties, production to date has provided confidence in management’s estimation and               governance
                       mine planning methods. the pending commissioning of the stage 4 process plant means that the current risk
                       rating remains high.

operational failures   the achievement of centamin’s operational targets will be subject to the timely completion of planned
and unscheduled        operational goals on budget and the effective support of centamin’s personnel, contractors, systems, procedures
interruptions          and controls and suppliers. any failure in this regard or any instances of unscheduled interruptions in centamin’s
                       operations due to mechanical or other failures or industrial relations related issues or problems or issues with the
                       supply of fuel and other goods or services including spare parts, machinery and explosives, may result in delays in
                       the achievement of operational targets with a consequent material adverse impact on centamin’s business, results
                       of operations, financial performance and prospects to include all logistics for consumables and parts.
                       mitigating factors include management’s assessment of critical components on the operational infrastructure on
                       a continuous basis and keep a large inventory of critical spares. in addition management closely monitor progress
                       of both normal operations and expansion projects and have regular dialogue with key project stakeholders and
                                                                                                                                                   financial statements




                       suppliers. operational risk for a mining project on a remote location is moderate, although the rating at present
                       is high due to the commissioning of stage 4.

     capital and            the capital costs for the sukari project and the development of centamin’s portfolio assets may be significantly
     operational cost       higher than anticipated due to, amongst other things, unforeseen delays in supplies, labour and material cost
     inflation may          inflation, local and international political events, or workforce disruption. in turn, this may result in centamin
     reduce anticipated     having to make unexpected calls on its treasury reserves or otherwise seek to raise external financing, for which
                            there can be no guarantee of success and which may result in value dilution for current shareholders.
     returns
                            the sukari project has a limited operating history upon which centamin can base estimates of future operating
                            costs. the costs, timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote
                            location of the sukari project, as well as centamin’s other development opportunities. it is common in new mining
                            operations to experience unexpected problems and delays during construction, development, mine operation
                            and mine expansion. accordingly, centamin’s actual results may be subject to both greater variability and difficulty
                            in accurately predicting future operating costs and results than would be the case for a company with a longer
                            mining history. estimates of operating costs are based upon, amongst other things: anticipated tonnage, grades
                            and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed; anticipated recovery rates of gold and
                            other metals from the ore; and cash operating costs based on a bottom‑up approach utilising historical data.
                            cash operating costs, production and economic returns, and other estimates contained in previous studies or
                            estimates prepared by or for centamin may differ from those estimated costs currently anticipated by centamin.
                            whilst there can be no certainties, capital and operational cost control to date has provided confidence in
                            management’s budgeting and cost controls implementation.

     mine construction      planned construction and commissioning of the remainder of the expansion of the sukari project and any further
     and operational        expansion projects that centamin undertakes, may be delayed by a number of factors, which could have a
     risks                  material and adverse effect on centamin’s business, results of operations, financial performance and prospects.
                            mining projects can suffer delays in start‑up and commissioning due to late delivery of components, adverse
                            weather or equipment failures or delays in obtaining, or renewing where applicable, the required permits or
                            consents or gaining access to suitable skilled labour, as well as cost overruns and cost inflation. furthermore, mine
                            construction raises a range of social and environmental issues, including costs associated with rehabilitation of
                            areas which have been mined or otherwise disturbed, addressing areas of archaeological significance, forestry
                            and water matters, local social, health and community issues upon construction (including compensation for
                            land and crops) and again on closure of operations. any estimates for such costs made by the centamin group
                            may be insufficient and/or further issues and costs may be identified. any underestimated or unidentified social
                            and environmental costs related to the development and subsequent closure of a mine could potentially reduce
                            earnings and otherwise have a material and adverse effect on centamin’s business, results of operations, financial
                            performance and prospects.
                            construction is now largely complete with the commissioning phase now under way although increased
                            throughput is unlikely to increase materially until towards the end of q2 2014.

     reliance on key        the success of centamin’s operations and activities is dependent to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities
     personnel              of the directors and management team, including developing and maintaining or, in the context of the recent
                            political changes in egypt, renewing important relationships with governmental and regulatory authorities in
                            egypt. investors must be willing to rely to a significant extent on centamin directors and the management team’s
                            discretion and judgment. centamin’s ability to continue to retain, motivate and attract qualified and experienced
                            management personnel is vital to the group’s business. factors critical to retaining centamin’s present staff and
                            attracting and recruiting additionally highly qualified personnel include, amongst other things, centamin’s ability
                            to provide competitive compensation arrangements. centamin does not hold key person insurance in respect
                            of any members of its management team. there can be no assurance that centamin will be able to successfully
                            recruit and retain the necessary qualified personnel. the loss or diminution in the services of a member of its
                            management team or an inability to recruit, train and/or retain necessary personnel could have a material and
                            adverse effect on centamin’s business, results of operations, financial performance and prospects.
                            the group regularly assess its staff recruitment and retention policies, including its reward structures and
                            incentive plans, to assist with labour stability and maintain appropriate investment in training and development
                            to safeguard the skills of its work force and senior management. the risk of disruptions within the work force and
                            senior management remain elevated but the impacts are assessed as manageable.

     reliance on external   centamin’s underground mining operations at sukari are conducted by third party contractor barminco. centamin
     contractors            shareholders must be willing to rely to a significant extent on the expertise and competence of outside contractors
                            or sub‑contractors. when the world mining industry is buoyant there is increased competition for the services of
                            suitably qualified and/or experienced sub‑contractors, such as drilling contractors, assay laboratories, metallurgical
                            testwork facilities and other providers of engineering, project management and mineral processing services. as
                            a result, centamin may experience difficulties in sourcing and retaining the services of suitably qualified and/or
                            experienced sub‑contractors on suitable economic commercial terms. the loss or diminution in the services of
                            suitably qualified and/or experienced sub‑contractors or an inability to source or retain necessary sub‑contractors
                            or their failure to properly perform their services could have a material and adverse effect on centamin’s business,
                            results of operations, financial performance and prospects.
                            regular reviews are carried out in order to attract, retain and incentivise key employees, including the expatriate
                            workforce. assessments of arrangements with key contractors are undertaken on a regular basis to ensure that
                            contracted services and support meet business requirements and expectations.

currency and gold    a significant portion of centamin’s operating expenses are incurred in us dollars, egyptian pounds and great
price risk           british pounds, whilst its revenues from gold sales are in us dollars. furthermore, centamin does not currently
                     maintain any facilities for hedging its exposure to currencies or the price of gold, which fluctuates as a result of a
                     number of factors beyond centamin’s control.
                     any appreciation in currencies other than us dollars in which the group incurs material expenses or adverse
                     fluctuations in the gold spot price, could have a material and adverse effect on centamin’s business, results of
                     operations, financial performance and prospects.

                     forward foreign exchange contracts. natural hedges are utilised wherever possible to offset foreign currency
                     liabilities. the company maintains a policy of not hedging its currency positions and maintains currency holdings
                     in line with underlying requirements and commitments.

political risk       activities are entirely in egypt, a country which has been subject to civil and military disturbance in the last
                     two years. there is no assurance that future political and economic conditions in egypt will not result in the
                     government of egypt adopting different policies respecting foreign development and ownership of mineral
                     resources. any such change in policy may result in changes in laws affecting ownership of assets, use of
                     explosives, tenure and mineral concessions, taxation, royalties, rates of exchange, environmental protection,
                     labour relations, repatriation of income and return of capital, which may affect both centamin’s ability to

                     exploration and exploitation rights to date. egypt also has limited experience of large scale mining operations and
                     current laws do not necessarily reflect current international practices (for example in relation to 24 hour blasting
                     techniques).
                     centamin actively monitors legal and political developments in egypt and ethiopia and actively engages in
                     dialogue with relevant government and legal policy makers to discuss all key legal and regulatory developments.
                     the potential for serious impact should be balanced against the egyptian government’s support of centamin’s
                     investment and contribution to both revenue and development of the mining industry.

external             external perceptions of egypt with respect to political and economic instability and civil unrest may have

reserve and          mineral resource and reserve figures are prepared by centamin group personnel, with the assistance of
resource estimates   independent geologists. by their nature, mineral resources and reserves are estimates based on a range of
                     assumptions, including geological, metallurgical and technical factors. there can be no guarantee that the
                     anticipated tonnages or grades expected by centamin will be achieved.
                     management has implemented processes to continuously monitor and evaluate the current life of the sukari
                     gold mine, mine plans and production targets. the most recent technical update was completed in the
                     form 43‑101f1 dated 30 january 2014 and is available at www.sedar.com. this takes into account the latest drill
                     results, higher cost environment and the timing of the stage 4 commissioning. whilst there are no certainties,
                     production to date has provided confidence in management’s estimation and mine planning methods.

hazardous            the mining operations of centamin at sukari are often carried out in extreme temperatures. whilst centamin
operating            maintains strict health and safety policies, centamin remains susceptible to the possibility that liabilities might
conditions           arise as a result of breaches of these requirements, accidents, fatalities or other workforce‑related misfortunes,
                     some of which may be beyond centamin’s control. the occurrence of any accidents or any of these situations
                     could delay production, increase production costs and/or result in material liability for centamin.
                     safety induction and training programs for staff are an essential component of the policies and procedures at
                     sukari and throughout centamin. sukari has a strong safety culture and a good track record with a ltifr of
                     0.36 per 200,000 man hours in 2013, a strong improvement on 2012. the group manages effectively the risks to
                     health and safety and so the risk is low.

     management discussion & analysis and business review

     litigation risks      centamin’s finances, and its ability to operate in egypt, may be severely adversely affected by current and any future
                           litigation proceedings and it is possible that further litigation could be initiated against centamin at any time.
                           centamin is currently involved in litigation that relates both to (a) the validity of its exploitation lease at sukari and (b) the
                           price at which it can purchase diesel fuel oil.
                           in order to mitigate this risk centamin has:
                           1. engaged appropriate legal advice and continues to actively pursue its legal rights with respect to the existing
                               litigation and its legal advisers believe that centamin will ultimately be successful in both of these cases; and
                           2. management and the company’s legal advisers monitor both activity in court and local media for signs of any
                              litigation that may threaten its operations, finances or prospects.
                           the potential for serious impact should be balanced against centamin’s adherence to local laws and agreements,
                           as well as the egyptian government’s support of centamin’s investment and its proposals for a new investment
                           law that could protect centamin against litigation of this nature.

                         background to remuneration decisions
                         while this year has continued to be challenging, the company has been
                         successful in a number of important ways:
                         • year gold production 356,943 oz (36% increase on 2012);
                         • cash operating costs of under us$663 per ounce (below budget of us$700




                                                                                                                       performance review
                           per ounce);
                         • safety record of 0.36 ltifr in 2013 (48% reduction on the prior year);
                         • stage 4 expansion project largely on time and on budget (total capital
                           expenditure estimate of us$331.2 million);
                         • strong financial position us$106 million cash and liquid assets at year end;
edward haslam
                         • systematic exploration continued both at sukari and ethiopia, although
chairman of the            only low grade mineralisation discovered resulting in the write down and
remuneration committee     relinquishing of the licence areas; and
                         • m&a activity culminated in a recommended takeover offer of ampella mining
                           ltd to extend exploration into prospective and stable burkina faso.




                                                                                                                       management discussion
                         therefore, while there are still challenges in respect of the litigation, details of
                         which are set out in note 20 to the financial statements, from an operational and
                         financial perspective this has been a successful year and it is within that context
                         that the key remuneration decisions for 2013 described below have been taken.

                         last year some shareholders expressed concerns about certain aspects of the
                         remuneration policy and practice. we have been working on those concerns and
                         i would like to thank the shareholders, whom i had an opportunity to meet this
                         year, for their constructive feedback on the remuneration report. i will continue
                         to engage with shareholders throughout 2014.                                                  governance
                         simple approach to remuneration
                         we continue to be wedded to a simpler remuneration structure for the executive
                         directors with only three elements of remuneration for josef el‑raghy, base pay,
                         contribution to a pension and annual bonus and two elements for trevor schultz,
                         base pay and annual bonus. as described below we are not proposing any changes
                         in this policy for the coming year. we believe this simple approach allows a cleaner
                         line of sight for the delivery of performance in the short term while meaningful
                         actual shareholdings means the executives’ wealth is directly linked to the fortunes
                         of other shareholders. there is no better union of interest between shareholder and
                         executives than for executives to be substantial shareholders in their own right.
                                                                                                                       financial statements




                         as reported last year josef el‑raghy no longer participates in any long term
                         incentive plans, the committee being of the view the his significant shareholding is
                         a sufficient link to shareholders’ interests. trevor schultz award of 1,000,000 shares
                         under the terms of the directors loan funded share plan failed to achieve the
                         necessary performance criteria, after the year end and therefore it was agreed that
                         these awards lapse. he will receive no further awards for long term incentives.

                         for employees the complex loan funded arrangements that previously existed
                         have been replaced with one simple deferred bonus share plan.

6. long term incentive arrangements
introduction
the company has had a number of share schemes intended to facilitate employee and executive participation in the
capital value of the company. a number of these share schemes were developed to take account of australian tax law.
with the review last year and committee concluding that the schemes were too complex and failed to provide any
meaningful motivation or link to shareholder interests those scheme are no longer being used.

the existing executive directors no longer participate in any long term incentive arrangement and neither executive
director has any outstanding award under any company share scheme.




                                                                                                                                           management discussion
there is a deferred share plan for senior management detailed below.

deferred bonus scheme (not for directors)
this plan, introduced in 2013, allows the annual bonus to be matched with shares which are then ordinarily released in
three annual tranches, conditional upon the continued employment with the group. the plan was introduced as a review of
annual bonus arrangements for management with the objectives of:

(1) increasing the variable pay element of remuneration;
(2) introducing a new retention element in the remuneration package; and
(3)	linking part of that reward to the medium‑term share performance of the company.                                                      governance

for the initial year and to introduce the plan, on 4 june 2013, the company offered to participants of existing plans the
opportunity to replace awards with an initial one off award under the deferred bonus share plan.

the plan is not open to directors of the company.
                                                                                                                                           financial statements

     this was the rollover plan for the centamin egypt ltd 2011 employee loan funded share plan. under the plan, employees
     receive a loan to buy shares in the company. the shares are then held in trust for the employee and at the end of three
     years the employees can repay the loan and receive the shares.

     after the year end, there were no outstanding awards under this plan as the performance criteria were not met and awards
     lapsed. there is no current intention to use this plan. the plan operated in the same way as the employee plan, except that
     there are mandatory performance conditions attached to the director plan, and that the shares vested in one tranche, three
     years from the date of grant.

     at 31 december 2013, having carried out initial calculations, the participants had no prospect of the performance
     conditions being met, however the plan operated in the following way. the awards were due to vest three years from the
     date of grant, dependent on the achievement of comparative total shareholder return, with 50% based upon the ftse 250
     and 50% based upon comparator companies. 25% of the award would vest for median performance and 100% for upper
     quartile performance under each element. comparator companies were selected by the remuneration committee from
     peers in the mining sector and were as follows: new gold inc; centerra gold inc; randgold resources; hochschild mining;
     alamos gold inc; european goldfields ltd; eldorado gold corp; african barrick gold and petropavlovsk plc.

     employee share option plan
     there are no outstanding awards under this plan and there is no current intention to use the plan. awards under the plan
     were subject to performance criteria for senior management based upon share price, financial, production or key tasks.

                           and prospects.
                           any dispute with emra may adversely affect the centamin group’s
                           ability to manage the sukari project in the most effective way. such
                           a dispute could arise under the cost recovery and profit share
                           provisions of the sukari concession agreement.
                           the successful management of the sukari gold mine is in part
                           dependent on maintaining a good working relationship with emra.
                           the group has regular meetings with officials from emra and
                           invests time in liaising with relevant ministry and other governmental
                           representatives. management and the board of directors believe
                           the group has a positive and constructive working relationship
                           with emra. the group complies with all terms and conditions
                           of the concession agreement covering the sukari gold mine.
                           emra has equal representation on the board of sukari gold
                           mines and is involved to that extent in approving and auditing all
                           work programmes and expenditures. emra inspectors are closely
                           involved in monitoring all aspects of the sukari operations. current
                           discussions with emra are focused on determining the exact timing
                           and quantum of the first payment of profit sharing for sukari. whilst
                           the impact would be high, management believes there is a low
                           probability of a material deterioration in relationships with emra,
                           particularly following the prepayment in relation to future profit

92   centamin plc annual report 2013




     notes to the consolidated financial statements
     for the year ended 31 december 2013

     1. general information
     centamin plc (the “company”) is a listed public company, incorporated in jersey and operating through subsidiaries and
     jointly controlled entities operating in egypt, ethiopia, united kingdom and australia. it is the parent company of the
     group, comprising the company and its subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities.

     registered office and principal place of business
     centamin plc
     2 mulcaster street
     st helier, jersey je2 3nj

     the nature of the group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the directors’ report and the performance
     review of the annual report.


     2. adoption of new and revised accounting standards
     in the current year, no new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted that have affected the amounts
     reported in these financial statements.

     standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position
     the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year. their adoption
     has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but, with the exception of the
     amendment to ifrs 1, may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
     ifrs 1 (amended) government loans         the amendment addresses how a first‑time adopter would account for a
                                               government loan with a below‑market rate of interest when transitioning to
                                               ifrs. the amendments mirror the requirements for existing ifrs preparers
                                               in relation to the application of amendments made to ias 20 accounting for
                                               government grants and disclosure of government assistance in relation to
                                               accounting for government loans.

     ifrs 7 (amended) disclosures –            amends the disclosure requirements to require information about all
     offsetting financial assets and           recognised financial instruments that are set off. the amendments also require
     financial liabilities                     disclosure of information about recognised financial instruments subject to
                                               enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements even if
                                               they are not set off under ias 32. the iasb believes that these disclosures
                                               will allow financial statement users to evaluate the effect or potential effect
                                               of netting arrangements, including rights of set‑off associated with an entity’s
                                               recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities, on the entity’s
                                               financial position.

     ifrs 13 fair value measurement            ifrs 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value when such
                                               measurements are required or permitted by other standards. the adoption
                                               of ifrs 13 has not had any significant impact on the fair value measurements
                                               carried out by the group and the amounts reported within the unaudited
                                               interim condensed consolidated financial statements. ifrs 13 requires
                                               specific disclosures on fair values, some of which replace existing disclosure
                                               requirements in other standards, including ifrs 7 financial instruments:
                                               disclosures. ifrs 13 also results in an amendment to ias 34 requiring that
                                               some of these disclosures relating to financial instruments are made in the
                                               unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

     improvements to ifrs 2009 – 2011          aside from those items already identified above, the amendments made to
                                               standards under the 2009 – 2011 improvements to ifrs 2 have had no impact
                                               on the group.

                                                                                            centamin plc annual report 2013     93




                                                                                                                                     introduction
at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by
the eu):

ifrs 9                                    financial instruments
ifrs 10                                   consolidated financial statements
ifrs 11                                   joint arrangements
ifrs 12                                   disclosure of interests in other entities




                                                                                                                                     strategic report
ias 27 (revised)                          separate financial statements
ias 28 (revised)                          investments in associates and joint ventures (2011)
ias 32 (revised)                          offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
ias 36 (revised)                          recoverable amount disclosures for non‑financial assets

the directors are still considering the impact of adoption of new accounting standards and note that the main impacts
upon the adoption of the new standards will be:

• ifrs 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments;
• ifrs 10 and 11 will introduce revised definitions of control and joint arrangements and the group will consider the
  accounting for the concession agreement under this guidance. the directors’ determination of the appropriate




                                                                                                                                     performance review
  treatment under the new accounting standards is not expected to have a material impact in the year of adoption; and
• ifrs 12 will impact the disclosure of interests the group has in other entities.

beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a
detailed review has been completed.


3. summary of significant accounting policies
basis of preparation
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (“ifrs”)
adopted by the european union (“eu ifrs”) and therefore the group financial statements comply with article 4 of the eu




                                                                                                                                     management discussion
ias regulation.

there are no changes in these accounting policies for the year ended 31 december 2013 except as disclosed in note 3
below “changes in accounting policy”.

changes in accounting policy
ifrs 13 fair value measurement
the group adopted ifrs 13 fair value measurement on its effective date of 1 january 2013. ifrs 13 establishes a single
framework for measuring fair value when such measurements are required or permitted by other standards. the adoption
of ifrs 13 has not had any significant impact on the fair value measurements carried out by the group and the amounts
reported within the group financial statements. ifrs 13 requires specific disclosures on fair values, some of which replace          governance
existing disclosure requirements in other standards, including ifrs 7 financial instruments: disclosures.

a number of other amendments to accounting standards issued by the international accounting standards board
also apply for the first time in 2013. these do not have a significant impact on the accounting policies. these financial
statements are denominated in united states dollars, which is the functional currency of centamin plc. all companies in the
group use the united states dollar as their functional currency except for sheba exploration holdings limited and sheba
exploration limited that use the great british pound. all financial information presented in united states dollars has been
rounded to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated.

these financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for the revaluation of certain
non‑current assets and financial instruments. cost is based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange
                                                                                                                                     financial statements

94   centamin plc annual report 2013




     notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
     for the year ended 31 december 2013

     3. summary of significant accounting policies continued
     principles of consolidation
     the consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of all the entities that comprise
     the consolidated entity, being the company (the parent entity) and its subsidiaries as defined in ias 27 consolidated and
     separate financial statements. consistent accounting policies are employed in the preparation and presentation of the
     consolidated financial statements.

     the consolidated financial statements include the information and results of each subsidiary from the date on which the
     company obtains control and until such time as the company ceases to control such entity. control is achieved where
     the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from
     its activities.

     in preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions, and unrealised profits
     arising within the consolidated entity are eliminated in full.

     sukari gold mines (“sgm”) is jointly controlled by pgm and emra on a 50% equal basis. for accounting purposes,
     sgm is wholly consolidated within the centamin group of companies reflecting the substance and economic reality of the
     concession agreement (see note 23). pursuant to the concession agreement, pgm solely funds sgm’s activities. pgm is
     also entitled to recover the following costs and expenses payable from sales revenue (excluding the royalty payable to
     are) (a) all current operating expenses incurred and paid after the initial commercial production; (b) exploration costs,
     including those accumulated to the commencement of commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated
     cost per annum); and (c) exploitation capital costs, including those accumulated prior to the commencement of commercial
     production (at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum).

     emra is entitled to a share of sgm’s net production surplus (defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to are
     and recoverable costs). accordingly, no emra entitlement has been recognised to date. any payment made to emra
     pursuant to these provisions of the concession agreement will be recognised as a variable charge in the income statement.

     going concern
     these financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2013 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
     contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the normal course of operations. during the year
     the operation of the mine was affected by two legal actions. a detailed summary of the litigation is available in note 20
     of these financial statements. the first of these followed from a decision taken by egpc to charge international, not local
     (subsidised) prices for the supply of diesel fuel oil, and the second arose as a result of judgment of an administrative court
     of first instance in relation to, amongst other matters, the company’s 160km2 exploitation lease.

     in relation to the first decision, the company remains confident that in the event that it is required to continue to pay
     international prices, the mine at sukari will remain commercially viable. similarly, the company remains confident that
     the appeal it has lodged in relation to the decision of the administrative court will ultimately be successful, although
     final resolution of it may take some time. on 20 march 2013 the supreme administrative court upheld the company’s
     application to suspend the decision until the merits of the company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus providing
     assurance that normal operations would be able to continue during this process.

     in the unlikely event that the group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are
     restricted to a reduced area, it is the directors’ belief that the group will be able to continue as going concern.

     the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will have adequate resources to continue in operational
     existence for the foreseeable future. thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the
     financial statements.

     accounting policies
     accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner which ensures that the resulting financial statements satisfy the
     concepts of relevance and reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying transactions or other events
     is reported.

     the following significant policies have been adopted in the preparation and presentation of these financial statements:

     cash and cash equivalents
     cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. cash equivalents are short-term, highly-liquid investments that are
     readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

                                                                                                     centamin plc annual report 2013   95




                                                                                                                                            introduction
financial instruments
financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the group’s balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

financial liabilities and equity
debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangement.




                                                                                                                                            strategic report
equity instruments
an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its
liabilities. equity instruments issued by the group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

financial liabilities
financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (“fvtpl”) or other
financial liabilities.

financial liabilities at fvtpl
financial liabilities are classified as at fvtpl when the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at
fvtpl. a financial liability is classified as held for trading if:




                                                                                                                                            performance review
• it has been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or
• on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the group manages together and has
  a recent actual pattern of short‑term profit taking; or
• it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.

a financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading may be designated as at fvtpl upon initial recognition if:

• such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise
  arise; or
• the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and




                                                                                                                                            management discussion
  its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the group’s documented risk management or
  investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
• it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and ias 39 financial instruments: recognition
  and measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at fvtpl.

financial liabilities at fvtpl are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in
profit or loss. the net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and
is included in the “other gains and losses” line item in the income statement.

other financial liabilities
other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. other financial          governance
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense
recognised on an effective yield basis. the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a
financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. the effective interest rate is the rate that
exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate,
a shorter period.

derecognition of financial liabilities
the group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or
they expire.

financial assets
                                                                                                                                            financial statements




financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a
contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and
are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through
the profit or loss which are initially measured at fair value.

subsequent to initial recognition, investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost in the company financial statements.
other financial assets are “loans and receivables”. the classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial
assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.

     effective interest method
     the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest
     income over the relevant period. the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts
     through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on
     initial recognition.

     available-for-sale financial assets (“afs”)
     listed shares and listed redeemable notes held by the group that are traded in an active market are classified as being
     afs and are stated at fair value. the group also has investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market
     but that are classified as afs financial assets and stated at fair value (because the directors consider that fair value can be
     reliably measured). fair value is determined in the manner described in note 26. gains and losses arising from changes
     in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated profits with the exception of impairment
     losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets,
     which are recognised directly in profit or loss. where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the
     cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.

     dividends on afs equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the group’s right to receive the dividends
     is established.

     the fair value of afs monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and
     translated at the spot rate at the balance sheet date. the foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in profit
     or loss are determined based on the amortised cost of the monetary asset. other foreign exchange gains and losses are
     recognised in other comprehensive income.

     loans and receivables
     trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
     market are classified as “loans and receivables”. loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective
     interest rate method less impairment. interest is recognised by applying the effective interest rate except for short‑term
     receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.

     impairment of financial assets
     financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each
     reporting date. financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events that
     occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been
     impacted. for financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s
     carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.

     the carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the
     exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
     when a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. subsequent recoveries of amounts
     previously written off are credited against the allowance account. changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account
     are recognised in profit or loss.

     with the exception of available‑for‑sale equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment
     loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised,
     the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent the carrying amount of the
     investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the
     impairment not been recognised.

     in respect of available‑for‑sale equity instruments, any subsequent increase in fair value after an impairment loss is
     recognised in other comprehensive income.

                                                                                              centamin plc annual report 2013     97

derecognition of financial assets
the group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
if the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the
transferred asset, the group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have
to pay. if the group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the group
continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.




                                                                                                                                       strategic report
employee benefits
a liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave
and sick leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of being measured reliably.

liabilities recognised in respect of employee benefits expected to be settled within twelve months, are measured at their
nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement. liabilities recognised in respect
of employee benefits which are not expected to be settled within twelve months are measured as the present value of
the estimated future cash flows to be made by the consolidated entity in respect of services provided by employees up to
reporting date.

the company contributes to, but does not participate in, compulsory superannuation funds on behalf of the employees
and directors in respect of salaries and directors’ fees paid. contributions are charged against income as they are made.

exploration, evaluation and development expenditure
exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to each separate area of interest are recognised as an exploration and
evaluation asset in the year in which they are incurred where the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and
(b) at least one of the following conditions is also met:
   (i) the exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful development and
       exploration of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; or




                                                                                                                                       management discussion
   (ii) exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date reached a stage which
        permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and
        significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.

exploration and evaluation assets are initially measured at cost and include acquisition of rights to explore, studies,
exploration drilling, trenching and sampling and associated activities. general and administrative costs are only included in
the measurement of exploration and evaluation costs where they are related directly to operational activities in a particular
area of interest.

exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances (as defined in ifrs 6
exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources) suggest that the carrying amount of exploration and evaluation
                                                                                                                                       governance
assets may exceed its recoverable amount. the recoverable amount of the exploration and evaluation assets (or the
cash‑generating unit(s) to which it has been allocated, being no larger than the relevant area of interest) is estimated to
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount
of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised
for the asset in previous years.

where a decision is made to proceed with development in respect of a particular area of interest, the relevant exploration
and evaluation asset is tested for impairment, reclassified to mine development properties, and then amortised over the life
of the reserves associated with the area of interest once mining operations have commenced.
                                                                                                                                       financial statements




mine development expenditure is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
when commercial production in an area of interest has commenced, the associated costs are amortised over the
estimated economic life of the mine on a units of production basis.

changes in factors such as estimates of proved and probable reserves that affect unit of production calculations are dealt
with on a prospective basis.

     foreign currencies
     the individual financial statements of each group entity are presented in its functional currency being the currency of the
     primary economic environment in which the entity operates. for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements,
     the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in united states dollars, which is the functional currency of the
     group and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. all companies in the group use the united
     states dollar as their functional currency except for sheba exploration holdings limited (previously, sheba exploration (uk)
     plc) and sheba exploration limited that use the great british pound.

     in preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional
     currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. at each reporting date,
     monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the reporting date.
     non‑monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing
     on the date when the fair value was determined. non‑monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a
     foreign currency are not retranslated. exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

     inventories
     inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. costs including an appropriate portion of fixed and
     variable overhead expenses are assigned to inventory on hand by the method appropriate to each particular class of
     inventory, with the majority being valued on a weighted average cost basis. net realisable value represents the estimated
     selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.

     ore stockpiles, gold in circuit and bullion are valued applying absorption costing.

     interests in joint ventures
     jointly controlled entities
     where the group is a venturer (and so has joint control) in a jointly controlled entity, the group recognises its share of the
     assets, liabilities, income and expenses, line by line, in the consolidated financial statements.

     sgm is wholly consolidated within the centamin group of companies, reflecting the substance and economic reality of the
     concession agreement (see note 23).

     leased assets
     leased assets are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards
     incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the lessee. all other leases are classified as operating leases.

     operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight‑line basis over the lease term, except where other
     systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
     contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

     property, plant and equipment (“ppe”)
     plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. plant and equipment will include
     capitalised development expenditure. cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item
     as well as the estimated cost of abandonment. in the event that settlement of all or part of the purchase consideration
     is deferred, cost is determined by discounting the amounts payable in the future to their present value as at the date
     of acquisition.

     depreciation is provided on plant and equipment. depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the
     net cost or other revalued amount of each asset over its expected useful life to its estimated residual value.

     the estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each annual financial
     period, with the effect of any changes recognised on a prospective basis.

     freehold land is not depreciated.

                                                                                             centamin plc annual report 2013      99




                                                                                                                                       introduction
the following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:

plant and equipment		                 2 – 50 years
office equipment		                    3 – 7 years
mining equipment		                    2 – 13 years
land and buildings		                  4 – 20 years

the gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.




                                                                                                                                       strategic report
mine development properties
where mining of a mineral resource has commenced, the accumulated costs are transferred from exploration and
evaluation assets to mine development properties.

amortisation is first charged to new mine development ventures from the date of first commercial production. amortisation
of mine properties is on a unit of production basis resulting in an amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the
proved and probable ore reserves. the unit of production can be on a tonnes or an ounce depleted basis.

capitalised underground development costs incurred to enable access to specific ore blocks or areas of the underground
mine, and which only provide an economic benefit over the period of mining that ore block or area, are depreciated on a




                                                                                                                                       performance review
units of production basis, whereby the denominator is estimated ounces of gold in proven and probable reserves within
that ore block or area where it is considered probable that those resources will be extracted economically.

stripping activity assets
the group defers stripping costs incurred (removal of mine waste materials which provide improved access to further
quantities of material that will be mined in future periods). the group changed its accounting policy on stripping costs in
the production phase of a surface mine ifric 20 effective 1 january 2012. ifric 20 provides clarity on how to account for
and measure the removal of mine waste materials which provide access to mineral ore deposits. this waste removal activity
is known as “stripping”. there can be two benefits accruing to the entity from the stripping activity:

• usable ore that can be used to produce inventory; and




                                                                                                                                       management discussion
• improved access to further quantities of material that will be mined in future periods.

the costs of stripping activity to be accounted for in accordance with the principles of ias 2 inventories to the extent that
the benefit from the stripping activity is realised in the form of inventory produced. the costs of stripping activity which
provides a benefit in the form of improved access to ore is recognised as a non‑current “stripping activity asset” where the
following criteria are met:

(a) it is probable that the future economic benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity
    will flow to the entity;
(b) the entity can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved; and
(c) the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that component can be measured reliably.                              governance

when the costs of the stripping activity asset and the inventory produced are not separately identifiable, production
stripping costs are allocated between the inventory produced and the stripping activity asset by using an allocation basis
that is based on a relevant production measure. a stripping activity asset is accounted for as an addition to, or as an
enhancement of, an existing asset and classified as tangible or intangible according to the nature of the existing asset of
which it forms part. a stripping activity asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost or its revalued
amount less depreciation or amortisation and impairment losses. a stripping activity asset is depreciated or amortised on
a systematic basis, over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body that becomes more accessible
as a result of the stripping activity. the stripping activity asset is depreciated using a units of production method based on
the total ounces to be produced over the life of the component of the ore body.
                                                                                                                                       financial statements




deferred stripping costs are included in “stripping assets”, within tangible assets. these form part of the total investment in
the relevant cash‑generating unit, which is reviewed for impairment if events or a change in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. amortisation of deferred stripping costs is included in operating costs.

      impairment of assets (other than exploration and evaluation and financial assets)
      at each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
      there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. if any such indication exists, the recoverable
      amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). where the asset does
      not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the
      cash‑generating unit to which the asset belongs.

      recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. in assessing value in use, the estimated
      future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre‑tax discount rate that reflects current market
      assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future flows have not
      been adjusted.

      if the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash‑generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
      amount of the asset (cash‑generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. where an impairment loss subsequently
      reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash‑generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable
      amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have
      been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years.

      a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or less, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued
      amount, in which case the reversal of an impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

      revenue
      revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services in the normal
      course of business, net of discounts, vat and other sales‑related taxes.

      sale of goods
      revenue from the sale of mineral production is recognised when the group has passed the significant risks and rewards of
      ownership of the mineral production to the buyer, it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will
      flow to the group, the sales price can be measured reliably, and the group has no significant continuing involvement and
      the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. this is when insurance risk has
      passed to the buyer and the goods have been collected at the agreed location.

      where the terms of the executed sales agreement allow for an adjustment to the sales price based on a survey of the
      mineral production by the buyer (for instance an assay for gold content), recognition of the revenue from the sale of mineral
      production is based on the most recently determined estimate of product specifications.

      pre‑production revenues
      income derived by the entity prior to the date of commercial production is offset against the expenditure capitalised and
      carried in the consolidated statement of financial position. all revenues recognised after commencement of commercial
      production are recognised in accordance with the revenue policy stated above. the commencement date of commercial
      production is determined when stable and sustained production capacity has been achieved.

      interest revenue
      interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the amount of
      revenue can be measured reliably. interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding
      and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through
      the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.

      production royalty
      the arab republic of egypt (“are”) is entitled to a royalty of 3% of net sales revenue as defined from the sale of gold and
      associated minerals from the sukari project. this royalty is calculated and recognised on receipt of the final certificate of
      analysis document received from the refinery. due to its nature, this royalty is not recognised in cost of sales.

      business combinations
      acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. the consideration for each
      acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or
      assumed, and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree. acquisition‑related costs are
      recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

                                                                                                centamin plc annual report 2013    101




                                                                                                                                         introduction
where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition‑date fair value. subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted
against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). all other subsequent
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with
relevant ifrs. changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.

where a business combination is achieved in stages, the group’s previously‑held interests in the acquired entity are
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss,




                                                                                                                                         strategic report
if any, is recognised in profit or loss. amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have
previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would
be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.

the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under
ifrs 3 (2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:

• deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and
  measured in accordance with ias 12 income taxes and ias 19 employee benefits respectively;
• liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards
  are measured in accordance with ifrs 2 share‑based payment; and




                                                                                                                                         performance review
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with ifrs 5 non‑current assets held for sale.

assets held for sale and discontinued operations are measured in accordance with that standard. if the initial accounting
for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the group
reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. those provisional amounts are adjusted
during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the
amounts recognised as of that date.

the measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the group obtains complete information
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.




                                                                                                                                         management discussion
investments in associates
an associate is an entity over which the group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a
joint venture. significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee
but is not control or joint control over those policies.

the results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method
of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with
ifrs 5 non‑current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.

under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted
for post‑acquisition changes in the group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value
                                                                                                                                         governance
of individual investments. losses of an associate in excess of the group’s interest in that associate (which includes any
long‑term interests that, in substance, form part of the group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to
the extent that the group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

any excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. the goodwill
is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.
any excess of the group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over
the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

where a group entity transacts with an associate of the group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the
                                                                                                                                         financial statements




group’s interest in the relevant associate.

share‑based payments
equity‑settled share‑based payments with employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value
of the equity instrument at grant date. fair value is measured by the use of the black scholes model. where share‑based
payments are subject to market conditions, fair value was measured by the use of a monte‑carlo simulation. the fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity‑settled share‑based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on
the consolidated entity’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.

      3. summary of significant accounting policies continued
      accounting policies continued
      share-based payments continued
      equity‑settled share-based transactions with other parties are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received,
      except where the fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity
      instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.

      the expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of
      non‑transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. further details on how the fair value of
      equity‑settled share‑based transactions has been determined can be found in note 27. at each reporting date, the
      group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. the impact of the revision of the original
      estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period, with corresponding adjustment to the
      equity‑settled employee benefits reserve.

      issued capital
      incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax,
      from the proceeds.

      where the company or other members of the consolidated group purchases the company’s equity share capital, the
      consideration paid is deducted from the total shareholders’ equity of the group and/or of the company as treasury shares
      until they are cancelled. where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in
      shareholders’ equity of the group and/or the company.

      taxation
      income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

      current tax
      the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the
      consolidated statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible
      in other periods and items that are never taxable or deductible. the group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax
      rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

      deferred tax
      deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
      statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. deferred tax liabilities are generally
      recognised for all taxable temporary differences. deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary
      differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary
      differences can be utilised. such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from
      goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction
      that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

      deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries
      and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary
      difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. deferred tax assets
      arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the
      extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary
      differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

      the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that
      it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

      deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the
      liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted
      by the end of the reporting period. the measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences
      that would follow from the manner in which the group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the
      carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

      deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
      current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to
      settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

                                                                                              centamin plc annual report 2013     103

special considerations
in australia, centamin egypt limited and pharaoh gold mines nl have elected to form a tax consolidated group and
therefore are treated as a single entity for australian income tax purposes. pharaoh gold mines nl has elected into the
“branch profits exemption” whereby foreign branch income will generally not be subject to australian income tax.

in egypt, centamin has entered into a concession agreement that provides that the income generated by sukari gold
mining company’s activities is granted a long‑term tax exemption from all taxes imposed in egypt.

restoration and rehabilitation
a provision for restoration and rehabilitation is recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of exploration,
development and production activities undertaken, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably. the estimated future obligations include
the costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration and monitoring of the affected areas. the provision for future
restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the restoration obligation
at the reporting date. future restoration costs are reviewed annually and any changes in the estimate are reflected in the
present value of the restoration provision at each reporting date.

the initial estimate of the restoration and rehabilitation provision relating to exploration, development and mining
production activities is capitalised into the cost of the related asset and amortised on the same basis as the related asset,




                                                                                                                                        performance review
unless the present obligation arises from the production of the inventory in the period, in which case the amount is
included in the cost of production for the period. changes in the estimate of the provision of restoration and rehabilitation
are treated in the same manner, except that the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the provision is recognised as a
finance cost rather than being capitalised into the cost of the related asset.


4. critical accounting judgments
critical judgments in applying the entity’s accounting policies
the following are the critical judgments that management has made in the process of applying the group’s accounting
policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:




                                                                                                                                        management discussion
management has discussed its critical accounting judgments and associated disclosures with the company’s audit and
risk committee.

impairment of assets (other than exploration and evaluation and financial assets)
ifrs requires management to test for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
a finite lived asset may not be recoverable. as a result of the decline in the gold price, the group carried out an impairment
test over the assets, other than exploration and evaluation and financial assets.

impairment testing is an area involving management judgment, requiring assessment as to whether the carrying value of
assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash flow projections
which have been discounted at an appropriate rate. in calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain               governance
assumptions are required to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including management’s assessment of:

• forecast gold prices;
• discount rate;
• production volumes ;
• reserves and resources report; and
• costs and recovery rates.

each year, the group prepares and approves a formal one year budget for its operations. the group then extended the
data produced in the budget over the life of mine for inclusion in the value in use calculations. the impairment test is highly
                                                                                                                                        financial statements




sensitive to the gold price and an impairment would be required if the gold price falls below us$1,280 per ounce at a
discount rate of 12%.

      for the year ended 31 december 2013

      4. critical accounting judgments continued
      critical judgments in applying the entity’s accounting policies continued
      litigation
      the group exercises judgment in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related
      to pending litigation, as well as other contingent liabilities (see note 20 to the financial statements). judgment is necessary
      in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of
      the financial settlement.

      the group is currently a party to two legal actions both of which could affect its ability to operate the mine at sukari in the
      manner in which it is currently operated and adversely affect its profitability. the details of this litigation, which relate to
      the loss of the egyptian national subsidy for diesel fuel oil and the ability of the group to operate outside the area of 3km2
      determined by the administrative court of first instance to be the area of the sukari exploitation lease, are given in note
      20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed annual information form (“aif”) which is available on sedar
      at www.sedar.com. although it is possible to quantify the effects of the loss the national fuel subsidy, it is not currently
      possible to quantify with sufficient precision the effect of restricting operations to an area of 3km2.

      every action is being taken to contest these decisions, including the making of formal legal appeals and, although their
      resolution may take some time, management remain confident that a satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved.
      in the meantime, however, the group is continuing to pay international prices for diesel fuel oil. with respect to the
      administrative court ruling, on 20 march 2013 the supreme administrative court upheld the company’s application to
      suspend this decision until the merits of the company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus providing assurance that
      normal operations would be able to continue during this process.

      in the unlikely event that the group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are
      restricted to a reduced area, it is management’s belief that the group will be able to continue as going concern.

      recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation and development expenditure
      the group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in exploration and evaluation expenditure
      being capitalised for those projects where such expenditure is considered likely to be recoverable through future extraction
      activity or sale or where the exploration activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the
      existence of reserves.

      this policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances, in
      particular whether the group will proceed with development based on existence of reserves or whether an economically
      viable extraction operation can be established. such estimates and assumptions may change from period to period as new
      information becomes available. if, subsequent to the exploration and evaluation expenditure being capitalised, a judgment
      is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely or the project is to be abandoned, the relevant capitalised amount will
      be written off to the income statement.

      as described in note 13 to the financial statements, management have taken the decision not to renew the shehagne
      or finarwa/winibo (werie lehe and saharti) licences in respect of exploration rights held sheba explorations holding
      limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of centamin plc, and have thus written off all expenditure incurred to date including the
      acquisition costs in relation to those licences amounting to us$6,712,752.

      revenue recognition
      revenue from the sale of mineral production is recognised when the group has passed the significant risks and rewards of
      ownership of the mineral production to the buyer, it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will
      flow to the group, the sales price can be measured reliably, and the group has no significant continuing involvement and
      the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. this is when insurance risk has
      passed to the buyer and the goods have been collected at the agreed location.

      going concern
      under guidelines set out by the uk financial reporting council (“frc”) the directors of uk listed companies are required
      to consider whether the going concern basis is the appropriate basis of preparation of financial statements.

                                                                                                centamin plc annual report 2013     105

based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by management, in which any reasonably possible change in the key
assumptions on which cash flow forecast is based, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will have
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. key assumptions under‑pinning this
forecast include:

• litigation as discussed in note 20 to the financial statements;
• forecast gold price;
• production volumes; and




                                                                                                                                          strategic report
• costs and recovery rates.

these financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2013 have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis,
which contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the normal course of operations, in preparing

key sources of estimation uncertainty

the following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year:

provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs
the group is required to decommission, rehabilitate and restore mines and processing sites at the end of their producing
lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities. the provision has been calculated taking into account the
estimated future obligations including the costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration and monitoring of
the affected areas. the provision for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure
required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date.




                                                                                                                                          management discussion
ore reserve estimates
estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include assumptions on commodity prices, exchange rates, discount rates
and production costs for future cash flows. it also involves assessment and judgment of difficult geological models. the
economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate ore reserves may change from period to period. changes in
ore reserves affect the carrying values of mine properties, property, plant and equipment, provision for rehabilitation assets
and deferred taxes. ore reserves are integral to the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged to the statement of
comprehensive income and the calculation of inventory.

production forecasts from the underground mine at sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future resource and

depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs
depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs at the sukari mine is based on reserve estimates.
management and directors believe that these estimates are both realistic and conservative, based on current information.
however, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for further reserve definition,
the estimated reserves may change with a consequent negative impact on the carrying value of capitalised underground
mine development.

depreciation of the sukari plant
sukari plant, capitalised within plant and equipment, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 45 year economic life.
when determining the useful economic life of the plant, management has assumed that its exploration activities will lead
to future reserves increases at the sukari mine site which will extend its life beyond the current life of mine, which is 2029
based on current reserves. management have the option to extend the concession agreement by 30 years beyond its
current expiry date of 2035.

exceptional items
the directors consider that items of income or expense which are material by virtue of their unusual, irregular or
non‑recurring nature should be disclosed separately if the consolidated financial statements are to fairly present the
financial position and underlying business performance. in order to allow a better understanding of the financial
information presented within the consolidated financial statements, and specifically the group’s underlying business
performance, the effect of exceptional items are shown below.

in january 2012 the company received a letter from chevron to the effect that chevron would not be able to continue
supplying diesel fuel oil (“dfo”) to the mine at sukari at local subsidised prices. it is understood that the reason that
this letter was issued was that chevron had received a letter instructing it to do so from the egyptian general petroleum
                                                                                                                                                 governance

corporation (“egpc”). it is further understood that egpc itself took the decision to issue this instruction because it
had received legal advice from the legal advice department of the council of state (an internal government advisory
department) that the companies operating in the gold mining sector in egypt were not entitled to such subsidies.
in addition, the company during the year received a demand from chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies received
in the period from late 2009 through to january 2012, amounting to some us$60 million (eg£403 million).

the group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter (and, in particular, on the opinion given by legal advice
department of the council of state) and in consequence in june 2012 lodged an appeal against egpc’s decision in the
administrative courts. again, the group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is every prospect
of success. however, as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the continuation of supply, the group has since
                                                                                                                                                 financial statements

      as at the date of the financial statements, no final decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter.
      furthermore, the group remains of the view that an instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome
      and will look to recover funds advanced thus far should the court proceeding be concluded in its favour. however,
      management recognises the practical difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from the government and for this
      reason has, fully provided against the prepayment of us$97.0 million, as an exceptional item, of which us$55.6 million
      was provided for during 2013 as follows:

      (a) a us$51.0 million increase in cost of sales;
      (b) a us$1.7 million increase in stores inventories;
      (c) a us$2.1 million increase in mining stockpiles and ore in circuit; and
      (d) a us$0.8 million increase in property, plant and equipment (capital wip).

      this has resulted in a net decrease of us$51.0 million in the profit and loss.

companies within the group’s wholly‑owned australian resident entities formed a tax‑consolidated group with effect
from 1 july 2003. the head entity within the tax‑consolidated group is centamin egypt limited. the members of the
tax‑consolidated group are identified at note 21.

nature of tax funding arrangements and tax sharing agreements
entities within the tax‑consolidated group have entered into a tax funding arrangement and a tax‑sharing agreement with
the head entity. under the terms of the tax-funding agreement, centamin egypt limited and each of the entities in the
tax‑consolidated group has agreed to pay a tax-equivalent payment to or from the head entity, based on the current tax
liability or current tax asset of the entity. such amounts are reflected in amounts receivable from or payable to other entities
in the tax‑consolidated group.
                                                                                                                                                        governance
the tax-sharing agreement entered into between members of the tax‑consolidated group provides for the determination
of the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations.
no amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts
under the tax-sharing agreement is considered remote.

      trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost.
      the average age of the receivables is 18 days (2012: 35 days). no interest is charged on the receivables. there are no trade
      receivables past due and impaired at the reporting date, and thus no allowance for doubtful debts has been recognised.
      of the trade receivables balance, the gold sales debtor is all receivable from johnson matthey of canada. the amount due
      has been received subsequent to year end and was considered to be fully recoverable.

      the directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value.

during the year, as a result of the decline in the gold price, the group carried out a review of the recoverable amount of the
property, plant and equipment. the review did not lead to a recognition of an impairment loss. the discount rate used in
measuring value in use was 12% per annum and the assumed average gold price was us$1,342 per ounce. no impairment
was performed in 2012 as there was no indication of impairment.

      the exploration and evaluation asset relates to the drilling, geological exploration and sampling of potential ore reserves.
      during the prior year the group acquired the exploration rights in sheba exploration holdings limited (previously, sheba
      exploration (uk) plc) for us$10.2 million in relation to the licences of finarwa/winibo (werie lehe and saharti), granted
      until 29 november 2013, shehagne, granted until 21 september 2013 and the una deriam, granted until 19 march 2014.
      the una deriam licence is renewable for a period of one year, however, management has taken the decision not to renew
      the licences in respect of finarwa/winibo and shehagne and have thus written off all expenditure incurred to date including
      the acquisition costs in relation to those licences.

      and the cumulative investments revaluation reserve balance within the accumulated profit reserve has been transferred to

      the interest in associate relates to the group’s 39.64% equity interest in sahar minerals limited (“sahar”), of which 33%
      was acquired in july 2011, 3% acquired in december 2012, and a further 4% acquired in september 2013. the associate
      holds exploration rights and continues to explore, however, management has taken the decision to write off the costs
      associated with the interest held in sahar as a result of management’s intention to put all assets into hibernation as a result
      of funding requirements.

trade payables principally comprise the amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. the average credit
period taken for trade purchases is 69 days (2012: 38 days). trade payables are interest free for periods ranging from 30 to
180 days. thereafter interest is charged at commercial rates. the group has financial risk management policies in place to
ensure that all payables are paid within the credit timeframe.

the directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximate their fair value.

    31 december 2013 includes us$139,111 (31 december 2012: us$625,118) of annual leave entitlements. in the current year bonuses
    are classified within accruals.
(2) the provision for restoration and rehabilitation represents the present value of the directors’ best estimate of the future outflow of
    economic benefits that will be required to remove the facilities and restore the affected areas at the group’s sites discounted by 7%.
    this estimate has been made on the basis of benchmark assessments of restoration works required following mine closure and after
    taking into account the projected area to be disturbed over the life of the mine.

fuel supply
in january 2012, the group received a letter from chevron to the effect that chevron would only be able to supply diesel




                                                                                                                                         management discussion
fuel oil (“dfo”) to the mine at sukari at international prices rather than at local subsidised prices, which had the effect
of adding approximately us$150 per ounce to the cost of production. it is understood that the reason that this letter was
issued was that chevron had received a letter instructing it to do so from the egyptian general petroleum corporation
(“egpc”). it is further understood that egpc itself issued this instruction because it had received legal advice from the
legal advice department of the council of state (an internal government advisory department) that the companies
operating in the gold mining sector in egypt were not entitled to such subsidies. in november, the group received
a further demand from chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies received during the period from late 2009 through
to january 2012, amounting to eg£403 million (approximately us$60 million at current exchange rates).

the group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter (and, in particular, on the opinion given by the legal advice
department of the council of state) and in june 2012 lodged an appeal against egpc’s decision in the administrative                      governance
courts. again, the group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is a good prospect of success.
however, as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the continuation of supply whilst the matter is resolved, the group
has since january advanced funds to its fuel supplier, chevron, based on the international price for fuel.

as at the date of this document, no decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter. the group remains of the
view that an instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome and will look to recover funds advanced
thus far should the court proceeding be successfully concluded. however, management recognises the practical difficulties
associated with reclaiming funds from the government and for this reason has fully provided against the prepayment of
us$97.0 million, as an exceptional item. refer to note 6 of the accompanying financial statements for further details on the
impact of this exceptional provision on the group’s results for 2013.
                                                                                                                                         financial statements




no provision has been made in respect of the historic subsidies prior to january 2012 as, based on legal advice,
the company believes that the prospects of a court finding in its favour in relation to this matter remain very strong.

      concession agreement court case
      on 30 october 2012, the administrative court in egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by,
      amongst others, an independent member of the previous parliament, in which he argued for the nullification of the
      agreement that confers on the group rights to operate in egypt. this agreement, the concession agreement, was
      entered into between the arab republic of egypt, the egyptian mineral resources authority (“emra”) and centamin’s
      wholly‑owned subsidiary pharaoh gold mines (“pgm”), and was approved by the people’s assembly as law 222 of 1994.

      in summary that judgment states that, although the concession agreement itself remains valid and in force, insufficient
      evidence had been submitted to court in order to demonstrate that the 160km2 “exploitation lease” between pgm
      and emra had received approval from the relevant minister as required by the terms of the concession agreement.
      accordingly, the court found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 160km2 was not valid although it stated
      that there was in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km2. centamin, however, is in possession of the executed
      original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 160km2 exploitation lease was approved by the minister of
      petroleum and mineral resources. it appears that an executed original document was not supplied to the court.

      upon notification of the judgment the group took various steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine
      at sukari. these included lodging a formal appeal before the supreme administrative court on 26 november 2012.
      in addition, in conjunction with the formal appeal the group applied to the supreme administrative court to suspend the
      initial decision until such time as the court is able to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. on 20 march 2013 the
      court upheld this application thus suspending the initial decision and providing assurance that normal operations would be
      able to continue whilst the appeal process is under way.

      emra lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 27 november 2012, the day after the company’s appeal was
      lodged. furthermore, in late december 2012, the minister of petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and shortly thereafter
      publicly indicated that, in his view, the terms of the concession agreement were fair and that the “exploitation” lease
      was valid. the minister of petroleum also expressed support for the investment and expertise that centamin brings to
      the country. the company believes this demonstrates the government’s commitment to our investment at sukari and the
      desire to stimulate further investment in the egyptian mining industry.

      the company does not yet know when the appeal will conclude, although it is aware of the potential for the process in
      egypt to be lengthy. the company has taken extensive legal advice on the merits of its appeal from a number of leading
      egyptian law firms who have confirmed that the proper steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km² lease.
      it therefore remains of the view that the appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will ultimately be successful. in the
      event that the appellate court fails to be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the group, the operations
      at sukari may be adversely effected to the extent that the group’s operation exceeds the exploitation lease area of 3km²
      referred to in the original court decision.

      the company remains confident that normal operations at sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal case is heard.

      through its wholly owned subsidiary, pgm, the company entered into the concession agreement with emra and the
      arab republic of egypt granting pgm and emra the right to explore, develop, mine and sell gold and associated minerals
      in specific concession areas located in the eastern desert of egypt. the concession agreement came into effect under
      egyptian law on 13 june 1995.

      in 2001 pgm, together with emra, were granted an exploitation lease over 160 square kilometres surrounding the sukari
      project site. the exploitation lease was signed by pgm, emra and the egyptian minister of petroleum and gives tenure for
      a period of 30 years, commencing 24 may 2005 and extendable by pgm for an additional 30 years upon pgm providing
      reasonable commercial justification.

                                                                                             centamin plc annual report 2013    119

in 2006 sgm, was incorporated under the laws of egypt. sgm was formed to conduct exploration, development,
exploitation and marketing operations in accordance with the concession agreement. responsibility for the day‑to‑day
management of the project rests with the general manager, who is appointed by pgm.

the fiscal terms of the concession agreement require that pgm solely funds sgm. pgm is however entitled to recover
from sales revenue recoverable costs, as defined in the concession agreement. emra is entitled to a share of sgm’s net
production surplus or profit share (defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to are and recoverable costs).
as at 31 december 2013, pgm has not recovered its cost and accordingly, no emra entitlement has been recognised

to date, it is anticipated that the first payment to emra will become payable during 2015, any payment made to
emra pursuant to these provisions of the concession agreement will be recognised as a variable royalty charge to the
income statement.

the concession agreement grants certain tax exemptions, including the following:

• from 1 april 2010, being the date of commercial production, the sukari project is entitled to a 15 year exemption from
  any taxes imposed by the egyptian government on the revenues generated from the sukari project. pgm and emra
  intend that sgm will in due course file an application to extend the tax‑free period for a further 15 years. the extension
  of the tax‑free period requires that there has been no tax problems or disputes in the initial period and that certain
  activities in new remote areas have been planned and agreed by all parties;




                                                                                                                                      performance review
• pgm and sgm are exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect to the importation of machinery, equipment and
  consumable items required for the purpose of exploration and mining activities at the sukari project. the exemption

  consumables. such exemption will also be granted if the local substitution is more than 10% more expensive than the
  imported machinery, equipment or consumables after the additional of the insurance and transportation costs;
• pgm, emra and sgm and their respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export of gold and
  associated minerals produced from the sukari project;
• pgm at all times is free to transfer in us dollars or other freely convertible foreign currency any cash of pgm
  representing its share of net proceeds and recovery of costs, without any egyptian government limitation, tax or duty
• pgm’s contractors and sub‑contractors are entitled to import machinery. equipment and consumable items under the

potential risk adverse effects and ensure that net cash flows are sufficient to support the delivery of the group’s financial
targets whilst protecting future financial security. the group continually monitors and tests its forecast financial position
against these objectives.

the group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market; commodity; credit; liquidity; foreign exchange;
and interest rate. these risks are managed under board approved directives through the audit committee. the group’s
principal financial instruments comprise interest bearing cash and cash equivalents. other financial instruments include
trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations.

it is, and has been throughout the period under review, group policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments
be undertaken.                                                                                                                          governance

      (c) market risk
      the group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures,
      primarily with respect to the australian dollar, great british pound and egyptian pound. exposure to canadian dollars has
      diminished considerably when compared to prior periods. foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions
      and recognised assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. the risk
      is measured by regularly monitoring, forecasting and performing sensitivity analyses on the group’s financial position.

      financial instruments denominated in great british pound, australian dollar and egyptian pound are as follows:
                                                     great british pound           australian dollar             egyptian pound

      the group’s sensitivity to foreign currency has decreased at the end of the current period mainly due to the decrease in
      foreign currency cash holdings in australian dollars and great british pounds and a corresponding increase in us dollar
      cash holdings.

      the group has not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts. natural hedges are utilised wherever possible to offset
      foreign currency liabilities. the company maintains a policy of not hedging its currency positions and maintains currency
      holdings in line with underlying requirements and commitments.

      (d) commodity price risk
      the group’s future revenue forecasts are exposed to commodity price fluctuations, in particular gold prices. the group has
      not entered into forward gold hedging contracts.

(e) interest rate risk
the group’s main interest rate risk arises from cash and short‑term deposits and is not considered to be a material risk due
to the short‑term nature of these financial instruments. cash deposits are placed on term period of no more than 30 days
at a time.

the financial instruments exposed to interest rate risk and the group’s exposure to interest rate risk as at balance date
were as follows:

      (f) liquidity risk
      the group’s liquidity position is managed to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet its financial commitments
      in a timely and cost effective manner.

      ultimate responsibility or liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, who has established an appropriate
      management framework for the management of the group’s funding requirements. the group manages liquidity risk by
      maintaining adequate cash reserves and management monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity on the basis of
      expected cash flow. the tables above reflect a balanced view of cash inflows and outflows and shows the implied risk
      based on those values. trade payables and other financial liabilities originate from the financing of assets used in the
      group’s ongoing operations. these assets are considered in the group’s overall liquidity risk. management continually
      reviews the group liquidity position including cash flow forecasts to determine the forecast liquidity position and maintain
      appropriate liquidity levels.

      (g) credit risk
      credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the
      group. the group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral
      or other security where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. the group measures
      credit risk on a fair value basis. the group’s credit risk is concentrated on one entity, but the group has good credit checks
      on customers and none of the trade receivables from the customer has been past due. also, the cash balances held in
      canadian and australian dollars are held with a financial institution with a high credit rating.

      the gross carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the group’s maximum
      exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of collateral or other security obtained.

the following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair
value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

• level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets
  or liabilities;
• level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are
  observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability
  that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

27. share-based payments
employee share option plan (“esop”)
the consolidated entity had an employee share option plan (“esop”) in place for executives and employees. options
were issued to key management personnel under the employee option plan 2006 (previously the employee option plan




                                                                                                                                         management discussion
2002) as part of their remuneration. options were offered to key management personnel at the discretion of the directors,
having regard, among other things, to the length of service with the consolidated entity, the past and potential contribution
of the person to the consolidated entity and in some cases, individual performance. each share option converts into one
ordinary share of the company on exercise. the options carry neither rights to dividends nor voting rights and are not
transferable. options vest over a period of twelve months, with 50% vesting and exercisable after six months and the other
50% vesting and exercisable after twelve months of issue. all options are issued with a term of three years. at the discretion
of the directors part or all of the options issued to an executive or employee may be subject to performance based hurdles.
no performance based hurdles have been applied for options granted to date. upon exercise of the options the ordinary
shares received rank equally with the existing ordinary shares. no options have been offered under the esop in 2011
or 2012.                                                                                                                                 governance
executive directors loan funded share plan (“edlfsp”) and employee loan funded share plan (“elfsp”)
shares were issued to executive directors under the executive directors loan funded share plan edlfsp 2011 and
employees under the elfsp as part of their remuneration package. under the terms of the edlfsp and elfsp, the
company has provided a limited recourse and interest free loan to certain employees of the company for the purpose of
acquiring the new shares (the “loan”). the purchase of the shares has been funded by the loan and the shares will not
vest until certain performance conditions are met. in the event the performance conditions are not met, or the shares are
forfeited by the participant, the company can either re‑acquire the shares or direct the trustee to sell them on, offsetting
the proceeds against the outstanding loan amount and waiving the remainder of the loan. subject to performance
conditions and time based hurdles being met, the loan will be repayable by the relevant employee in full on the earlier
of the termination date of the loan (three years from the date of issue) or the date on which the shares are disposed of.
                                                                                                                                         financial statements




no options have been offered under the edlfsp and elfsp in 2012.

further details of the edlfsp and elfsp can be found in the notice of general meeting for the shareholder meeting held
on tuesday, 15 february 2011, and full copies of the plan are available upon request.

further details of the performance conditions can be found in the remuneration report.

      notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
      for the year ended 31 december 2013

      27. share-based payments continued
      2011 employee option scheme
      options were issued under the 2011 employee option scheme (“eos”) made in accordance with thresholds set in plans
      approved by shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on 14 december 2011. all employees
      of the group other than directors are able to participate in the 2011 eos. the committee shall select from time to time
      from such group the actual participants in the 2011 eos. there are no current plans for options to be granted under the
      2011 eos.

      the 2011 eos provides for employees (other than directors) to receive up to an annual aggregate of options over ordinary
      shares, with an exercise price calculated by either the volume weighted average closing price of ordinary shares sold on an
      exchange for the five trading days most recently preceding the day as at which the market value is calculated or if market
      value is required to be determined in another manner or another amount for the purposes of tax legislation in another
      jurisdiction, then the value is so determined at the date of issue. the ability to exercise the options is conditional on the
      group achieving its performance hurdles. for the initial grants to be made under the 2011 eos it is the current intention
      that the performance criteria will be the tsr performance criteria as detailed in the 2011 executive lfsp. further details of
      the performance conditions can be found in the remuneration report. there are no outstanding awards under this plan and
      there is no current intention to use the plan.

      under the 2011 eos the exercise price of the options is denominated in great british pounds. all options expire on the
      earlier of their expiry date or termination of the individual’s employment.

      deferred bonus share plan
      during the year the company implemented a deferred bonus share plan (“dbsp”) which is a long‑term share incentive
      arrangement for senior management (but not executive directors) and other employees (participants).

      under the dbsp, the board shall, at its absolute discretion, require such eligible participants to defer up to one hundred
      per cent (100%) of their bonus opportunity and such eligible participants shall not be paid their deferred bonus in cash but
      shall instead be granted a deferred bonus award over such number of shares provided that the eligible participant remains
      in employment on the date of grant (effectively the vesting date). the award of the deferred shares will not have any
      performance criteria attached. they will however be subject to a service period.

      on 4 june 2013, the group offered to both the beneficiaries of the shares awarded under the elfsp and to the majority
      of the beneficiaries of the options granted under the eos the choice to replace their awards and options with awards
      under the dbsp. the group has accounted for this change as modifications to the share-based payment plans and will be
      recognising the incremental fair value granted, measured in accordance with ifrs 2, by this replacement over the vesting
      period of the new dbsp awards.

      under this offer, each participant has been granted a number of awards under the dbsp equivalent to the number of shares
      or options held under the elfsp and eos respectively. such dbsp awards shall be subject to the terms and conditions
      of the dbsp and shall ordinarily vest in three equal tranches on the anniversary of the grant date, conditional upon the
      continued employment with the group. all offers made to participants were accepted.

      the total share‑based payment charge relating to centamin plc shares for the year is split as follows:

      no lfsp awards or eos options were granted during the year.

      the fair value of share‑based payments awarded under the lfsp and granted under the 2011 eos were measured
      by the use of the black scholes model where share‑based payments have non‑market based performance conditions.
      where share‑based payments are subject to market conditions, fair value was measured by the use of a monte‑carlo
      simulation. the monte‑carlo simulation has been used to model the company’s share prices against the performance
      of the chosen comparator group and the ftse 250 at the relevant vesting dates.

      supplied to the mine at sukari and the validity of the 160km2 exploitation lease.

      on 20 february the group announced that it had entered into an unconditional agreement for an off‑market takeover
      for all the issued, and to be issued, shares of ampella mining ltd (the “offer”). under the offer, ampella mining ltd
      (“ampella”) will receive one (1) new centamin share for every five (5) ampella shares held.

      the acquisition of ampella will add significant gold assets to centamin’s development portfolio, with c.2,200km2 of
      exploration ground in burkina faso, including the batie west gold project which hosts the konkera resource and
      c.1,200km2 of exploration ground across the border from batie west in côte d’ivoire. centamin intends to progress a
      substantial exploration programme at batie west, aimed at developing the potential for further significant resource growth
      and realising the project’s full value, ultimately through development of a sizeable producing operation.

total purchase consideration							
the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are subject to change following a detailed
assessment of the fair values which is currently under way. for the purposes of the preparation of the financial statements,
management has assumed the following:

(a) inventories have not been adjusted as management do not have sufficient information from which to estimate fair value;
(b) management have assumed that the book value of the property, plant and equipment is indicative of fair value as
    detailed valuations have not been performed; and




                                                                                                                                                management discussion
(c) management have allocated the excess of the fair value of the consideration of us$46.6 million over the fair value of the
    identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired to mineral rights.

the premium on acquisition of ampella has been calculated as follows:
								us$’000
                     12,363
current assets								
non-current assets 								1,523
current liabilities								(914)
                     35,854
mineral rights								                                                                                                                          governance
fair value of assets and liabilities acquired						                                                                           48,826

management have assumed that a deferred tax liability will arise for the full value of the uplift to the mine assets based
on the limited information available and accordingly have recorded a deferred tax liability of us$10.8 million. the mineral
right, inclusive of the deferred tax liability, amounts to us$46.6 million.

on completion of the detailed fair value exercise, certain intangible assets may be identified and recorded separately.
this may also result in the recognition of additional deferred tax liabilities. further, any intangible assets with a finite life
identified in the business combination will be required to be amortised over their useful life.

transaction costs are assumed to be approximately us$1.9 million.
                                                                                                                                                financial statements




there were no other significant events occurring after the reporting date requiring disclosure in the financial statements.
