city of dublin administrative areas




dublin city is divided into 5 administrative areas. these are called local areas and are used to co-ordinate the delivery of services.
wherever possible, the sustainability report considers both the direct impacts to this area, as well as the wider implications for the
greater dublin region.

engagement

sustainability is mainstreamed into all of the council’s planning and activities. looking to the future, our goal is to play a lead
role in creating a city and region premised on sustainable prosperity. as part of this process, we recognise the vital importance
of stakeholder engagement. we would like to encourage an open and honest dialogue as part of this process and encourage
feedback from stakeholders. thoughts, opinions, and ideas are all welcome via email at sustainability@dublincity.ie and through
facilities such as dublinked, your dublin your voice, and others.

sustainability report 2013 – towards a sustainable city region

report approach
dublin city council acknowledges that sustainability challenges and opportunities are often complex and overlapping; they cannot
be addressed in isolation, and instead require a comprehensive, systems-based approach. as such, our sustainability efforts must
address integrated social, economic, and environmental objectives. to coordinate this diversity of effort and the complexity of
the subject matter, we have relied on several internationally recognized tools and methodologies, and have employed standard
reporting structures across eight sustainability themes.

standard for sustainability reporting

the global reporting initiative (gri), an international standard for sustainability reporting,
has influenced the contents of this report. over 4000 organisations from 60 countries are
now using the gri framework for creating balanced, accurate, clear and reliable reports. the
index found at the end of this report directs readers to where gri standard disclosures are
referenced. as our sustainability planning evolves we will endeavour to include an increasing
number of these disclosures.

strategic sustainable development

the natural step framework for strategic sustainable development is being used
to integrate sustainable practices into dublin city council’s work. the internationally
recognized framework has been developed over 25 years and places an emphasis on impact,
replicability, flexibility, and backcasting. its purpose is to address challenges and sustainably
empower organisations and communities to innovate and accesses new opportunities. four
primary principles form the basis for the framework and have guided the vision and actions of
dublin city council.

sustainability indicators
our 2011 report, “developing a framework for sustainability indicators for dublin” began the process of framing a shared
vision for sustainable development in the dublin region. the report identified several sustainability themes represented by
more than 30 performance indicators. indicators were selected as part of a considered process designed to address inclusive
stakeholder participation, international best practices, and future goals and planning. more information on the indicator selection
process can be found in the 2011 report.

the value of data

the sustainability indicators offer an empirical window into the current state of the region’s sustainability efforts and a measurable
means to track future progress and success. the diverse environmental, economic, and social indicators presented in this report
bring together data drawn from a host of international, national, regional, and local sources. the sustainability indicators are
designed to:

        1. baseline the current position of the dublin region;

        2. benchmark against international best practices and set performance targets; and

        3. communicate performance to policymakers and citizens in an open and transparent manner.



the collection, analysis, and dissemination of these indicators run parallel to dublin city council’s mission to enable transparency
and data-driven innovation across the region. by linking data and metrics with planning and actions, we hope to demonstrate the
value of open-data and its practical applications. this year the sustainability indicators have for the first time been incorporated
into the body of the sustainability report. due to data availability, not all indicators are updated. additionally, space limitations
have restricted extended analysis of all indicators. please refer to the 2012 indicators report for additional indicator information.

sustainability report 2013 – towards a sustainable city region

baseline & benchmarking
having established a broad vision of the future, the first step towards reaching this vision is to develop a clear picture of dublin’s
sustainability position—its baseline. the sustainability report relies on a number of sources for baseline and benchmarking data,
three of these sources are outlined below.

dublin city sustainable energy action plan

                                              in 2005 dublin’s energy agency codema, on behalf of dublin city council, began
                                              developing the dublin city sustainable energy action plan (seap). the most recent
                                              version was published in 2010 and is currently being updated. the plan contains a
                                              vision of dublin becoming an energy-smart and efficient city and evaluates how to
                                              reduce energy consumption in areas such as planning, transport, residential and
                                              commercial buildings, while incorporating the use of renewable energy. as a signatory
                                              to the covenant of mayors, dublin city has joined over 2,000 cities and towns in a
                                              commitment to the principles of best practice in energy policy, while going beyond
                                              the eu targets of a 20% reduction in carbon emissions by 2020. in the specific case
                                              of the city council’s own energy use—for public lighting, water pumping, public
                                              buildings and facilities, and our fleet of vehicles, dublin city council intends to be the
                                              embodiment of good practice and has set a more ambitious target of 33% reduction
                                              over the timescale of the action plan. the results of the updated report will provide
                                              an update on the baseline from which we can measure progress and ensure that our
                                              objectives are being achieved.

flagships
every year we identify a flagship location or initiative that highlights actions towards sustainability. these projects illustrate how
multiple actions can support each other. the flagship approach raises awareness, creating the opportunity for piloted actions to be
replicated on a wider scale. over the last four years, successful initiatives have been deployed across the region and the last three are
described below. we are grateful to the individuals and teams who have driven these projects and look forward to future progress.

to local and global challenges are key priorities. energy information in ireland is available only recently at the national level through
sustainable energy authority of ireland (seai) publications.

energy consumption: energy use per capita (kg of oil equivalent) has reduced year on year in ireland from 2003 to 2011.
ireland is an average performer within the eu 27 (the 15th highest energy use per capita in 2010 (world bank, 2012)). energy use
in dublin city council in terms of megawatts per hour per capita (mwh/capita) reduced by approximately 18% from 2006-2011
(codema, 2012). dublin was ranked 18th out of 30 cities under the energy category in the siemens green city index in 2009.

sustainability report 2013 – towards a sustainable city region

infrastructure & land use indicators
policies and actions within land use and spatial planning are key to the sustainable development of the dublin region and central
to creating a high quality public domain. while important to measure, there are only a few recognised indicators that effectively
capture this theme. this is an area that requires further development.

vacancy rates: this indicator examines the number of vacant houses, flats and holiday homes as a percentage of the total
housing stock in dublin. in total the vacancy rate in the dublin region has reduced from 9.7% to 8.3% over a 5 year period (2006-
2011). the vacancy rate in dublin is significantly lower than the state figure which stood at 14.5% in 2011. south dublin has the
lowest levels of vacancy at 5.4% compared to 10.2% in dublin city. nationally, the highest levels of vacancy were recorded in
leitrim at 30.5%.

percentage of inhabitants within 300 metres of basic services: this indicator was not developed further as the
required data on proximity to local services in terms of distance is not readily available for the dublin region. currently, maps
published by the all-island research observatory provide the best resource on accessibility. the accessibility mapping facility
enables users to view estimated travel times by car to education facilities, airports and railway stations, healthcare services,
emergency services and large grocery outlets. the comprehensive dataset behind this mapping tool was not available to the
research team at the time of publication of this report.

tidy town awards: in the past half-century, hundreds of towns and villages throughout ireland have participated in the
national tidytowns competition. originally launched by bord fáilte as an initiative to encourage the fledgling tourism industry,
the competition quickly became a rallying cause for communities throughout the country, determined to maintain and improve
their local environment. while there is useful data available from the tidy town awards, it proved challenging to summarise in a
consistent manner. the feasibility of this indictor will be further investigated. see the tidy towns 2013 report for more information
on dublin's performance.

broadly speaking the city's biodiversity efforts are aimed at protecting and improving the natural environment. however, the
collection of headline biodiversity and environmental protection indicators are challenging to source.

proportion of waterways classified as at least ‘good’ status as per ec regulations: there is a general
trend of improving waters across the eastern river basin district with a large decrease in water bodies classified as poor or
bad since 1998 (from 31.5% to 19% of the total). there are 497 water bodies in total, 365 rivers, 75 groundwater, 28 lakes, 13
transitional, 8 coastal and 8 artificial water bodies in the erbd. there are still significant challenges, as some water bodies have
slipped into the moderate category between 2004-06 and 2007-09 (epa, 2010).

loss and gain of hedgerows: ireland has a rich hedgerow resource that is important for wildlife and needs to be managed
in the interests of both farming and biodiversity. the legislation regarding the removal of hedgerows is currently under review.
hedges in place since or before 2009 have protection by being deemed landscape features for the purposes of good agricultural
and environment condition, required for farm payments under the single farm payment scheme. agri-environment schemes
generally require protection and maintenance of hedgerows. in the past 2 years there has been considerable removal of scrub, due
to land eligibility rules in the single farm payment scheme. according to the national forestry inventory, hedgerows and scrub
comprise 3.9% and 1.3% of the total land area respectively (actions for biodiversity 2011 – 2016, ireland’s national biodiversity
plan). detailed information for the dublin region was a challenge to interpret. there have also been a number of studies between
2004 and 2011 including reports, guidelines and spatial biodiversity mapping to characterise the green infrastructure associated
with the designated strategic greenway network (sgn) in dublin city. further analysis is required to measure the loss and gain of
hedgerows across the dublin region.

in 2013, ireland’s unique hedgerow network is receiving the recognition it deserves with the establishment of a national hedgerow
database and a hedgerow appraisal system. ireland’s intricate network of hedgerows, primarily comprised of native trees, shrubs
and flowers, are a unique feature of our landscape and vital for safeguarding our environment (heritage council, 2013).

resource management
effectively managing resources and consumption levels is essential to ensuring the future competitiveness and sustainability of the
region. achieving greater efficiency in resource inputs and minimising waste also improves productivity and reduces costs.
