defining the report content and the aspect boundaries


the content of the report is based on the social, environment, economic and product sustain-
ability practices at dbl group. identifying of the aspects has been as per the guidelines of
global reporting initiative (gri) and indicators have been selected based on the availability of
information on those practices. some of the sustainability projects of dbl group are beneﬁ-
cial to the organization itself and some others are beneﬁtting the community as well. we have
tried to create meaningful connection between the sustainability practices of dbl group with
the reporting guidelines of gri.

this is our third reporting on sustainability adhering to the gri’s g4 sustainability reporting
guidelines. through this report we have focused our insights on setting goals, measuring
performance and managing change in order to implement better performances. we would like
to take our sustainability reporting practice to the next level by continuous improvement in our
future endeavors in reporting.

through this report, dbl group continues its journey in sustainability reporting on the
economic, environmental and social dimensions of its business activities. through progres-
sive advancement in reporting, dbl group is committed to report transparently on how it
manages its economic, environmental, social and governance performance.

sustainable development goals (sdgs)

countries around the world adopted a set of goals on september 25 2015 for eradicating
poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring prosperity for everyone as part of a new agenda
for sustainable development. speciﬁc targets under each goal are present which are to be
achieved within the year 20301 . these are popularly referred to as the sustainable
development goals or sdgs.




the sdgs have portrayed a huge potential for development by which a government, an
organization, and even an individual can contribute to. speciﬁc targets under each goal
attempt to map out activities which can facilitate the progression of not one but multiple
economies. the un global compact even refers to “making global goals local business”2
thus referring to the business beneﬁts along with development.

lean manufacturing

lean manufacturing is a business model and collection of tactical methods that emphasize
eliminating non-value added activities (waste) while delivering quality products on time at the
least cost with greater efﬁciency. the pro ect was launched following the guidelines and
support of walmart in jinnat fashions ltd. and various methods were implemented for the
sewing operations to fully transfer them into ean lines . the cutting and ﬁnishing operations
have also being converted to lean. the success in jinnat fashions ltd. enabled replication of
the practices to other garments and non-garments units including fabric knitting, fabric
dyeing and ﬁnishing, and garments printing. n addition,          roup introduced a guidebook
for smooth production entitled “elementary lean manufacturing”.

lean in non-garments units are making use of:

        5s
        machine wise standard minute value (smv)
        standard maintenance timing, scheduled maintenance
        visualization through display screen
        right first time (rft) for quality
        generating key performance indicators (kpi)



efficiency spill-over in rmg factories

the university of arwick studied e istence, determinants and nature of efﬁciency spill over
between sewing lines in the sewing departments of dbl’s factories. the representatives
interviewed all ine hiefs, analy ed daily efﬁciency data for all sewing lines from pril to
october 2014 with up to date statistical methods, and implemented experiments relating to
communication. a report of the assessment has been provided in 2015.

energy saving dyeing and finishing

multiple initiatives have been taken by dbl group in
order to reduce the consumption of energy for the
dyeing and ﬁnishing processes. the energy meters
installed ensure proper measurement of power
consumption. for certain fabrics, a temperature of
only 60 degrees celsius is required instead of the                      features
usual 100 for the dyeing, scouring-bleaching and
soaping processes. the dyes used allow                             low temperature dyeing
consumption of less energy as well.                                energy saving dyes
                                                                   moisture management
the wicking ﬁnishing process converts hydrophobic
fabrics (such as polyester) to hydrophilic. hydrophilic
products intake water much better than hydrophobic
ones and thus enable optimum consumption of
water. it also reduces weight loss of fabric during
processing: which allows better hand-feel and
increased fabric strength.




dbl idea club

dbl encourages ideas from any employee or worker, regardless of their designation. their
efforts are recognized through a monthly recognition system: the “employee of the month”. in
2015, a yearly recognition system was launched as well, named the “employee of the year”.
the program has been inaugurated in the knitting section and has been replicated for other
units too. this encourages employees to work at their full potential and gives them a feeling
of fairness as every employee has an equal shot at obtaining this reward. some of the ideas
have been stated below.

dbl quality control (qc) circles

the quality control (qc) circles promote employee engagement in workplace decision
making. the bottom-up approach to quality empowers employees and workers to make
effective decisions which influence production directly. each of the different operations has
their own qc circles. these teams have participated and won awards in both national and
international qc circle competitions. one such example is included below.

reducing fabric cutting/holes/split

the team “jaggroto”, which means “awakened”, was from one of dbl group’s fabric
ﬁnishing units. this team focused on reducing the cutting/holes/split from 15% to 5% in one
month. “jaggroto” analyzed and found out that the problem was due to lack of knowledge
of the workers and absence of an effective guidance to cut the fabrics. lack of awareness and
supervision were found to be considered as well. to counter the problems, the team:




                                               set up the standard operating procedure
                                               (sop) in appropriate areas

                                               training, and maintaining registers where
                                               the fabrics were being cut

                                        in less than a month, the production went up by
                                        5,012 kg per month and the problems of fabric due to
                                        the holes being present went down by 70%. the net

product programs


innovation in yarn production

our spinning mill makes use of different processes
that reduce the consumption of cotton. recycled
textile materials are used instead of raw cotton. the
coarse yarns used to produce fabrics reduce the
consumption of raw materials by up to 60%, as
wastage is used instead of raw cotton. up to 30%
recycled material can be used with virgin ﬁber to
produce ornamented products known as neppy
yarns. different colored neps are visible in the yarn
body and this works as ornamentation on the fabric
surface. mixing of spinning waste produces snow
yarns, which create a snow effect in the ﬁnished
fabrics which takes place in the new fashion trade.

the spinning ill now targets to have 20% of total
production made from these recycled products.

special certifications

organic cotton:

it is an initiative to reduce the negative impact on the
environment and consumers. organic cotton is
imported from india to process organic yarn.

better cotton initiative:
the program has been adopted to support the global
standards for better cotton and to promote our
commitment to make global cotton production
better for the producers, environment and the sector.

 wage and economic impacts


entry level wage

the levels of wages are a common standard for the industry regardless of gender or area of
operation this is constant throughout angladesh. ach worker is recruited in one of seven
grades (apart from trainees). for grades, higher than the lowest one, dbl pays at a premium
rate than the minimum as e perience is taken into account in these cases the lowest grade
usually comprises of people with little or no prior experience. the surplus amount depends on
the amount of prior experience the recruit has.




economic impacts

tions, dbl procures all other products and services
from haka.

“no water, no life. no blue, no green.”
                            sylvia earle

 environment management approach


dbl management is committed to manage and protect environment as an integral part of its
business. the company prefers to run its businesses in a responsible, environmentally sound
and sustainable manner by implementing effective environmental policy and procedures in all
the factories. a number of sustainability projects relating to environmental management
system have been implemented.

environment management approach

to reduce environmental footprint, dbl group has formed an environmental management
system (ems) team of ﬁve members. standard environmental policy and environmental
health and safety (ehs) policy have been formulated which addresses management of:



                               waste
                               energy
                               wastewater
                               noise pollution
                               water use
                               greenhouse gas (ghg)
                               ozone depleting substances (ods), etc.


these guiding activities help us address environmental challenges such as biodiversity
conservation. these are given priority to ensure environmental responsibilities and continual
improvement to reduce environmental impacts. as minimization of pollution is addressed, the
organization can ensure sustainability of the environment as an integral part of the business.


awareness training on environment

environment awareness trainings are conducted every month for all employees relating to
more general issues as well as on the production processes. all new employees, irrespective
of their levels, are briefed about ehs and environmental related aspects of the organization
during their induction process. employees are also made to undergo speciﬁc training with
respect to the nature of their work. need identiﬁcation for this is done by the respective heads
of departments for sending staff across for internal as well as external trainings.


monitoring and follow-up of environmental practices

the ems team carries out internal audits based on legal requirement and buyers’ standards to
review the environmental aspects. external (third party) audits are also involved to assess
important aspects such as stack and ambient air emission test, noise test, environmental
impact assessment (eia), etc. the different issues are addressed without delay: monthly
meetings are also conducted to tend to the remaining issues. the ems and ehs committees
in each unit are also involved to implement the environmental practices.

some initiatives to reduce water consumption

efficient machineries

we have installed state-of-the-art dyeing machines that consume 50% less water in
comparison to the average dyeing machines. this in turn has a direct effect on the receding
water table and energy consumption.

reduced water consumption

water consumption in the fabric dyeing process has been reduced from 120 liters per kg of
fabric to 55 liters per kg. less water means consumption of less dyes, chemicals, steam and

  energy management


energy is an essential point of the industrial sector to achieve sustainability as it is directly
related to ﬁnancial matters and global climate change. energy consumption within the
organization is monitored and tracked to reduce wastage of the energy. the following steps
are currently implemented to reduce energy consumption:

         preparation of energy management policy

         collecting consumption of water, steam, diesel, gas and electricity along with
         monthly production

         benchmarking and regulating energy consumption in consultation with the
         production team by doing process re-engineering and innovations

         reducing carbon emission

         reducing diesel consumption in generators by 10%

         taking initiative to reduce energy consumption by choosing alternative
         sources of non-renewable resources

         training employees on energy and environmental aspects within the industry


dbl currently makes use of non-renewable energy sources for its operations. in 2015-16,
10,861,313 liters of diesel and 40,972,573 cubic meters of natural gas has been used. for
transportation, 1,819,394 cubic meters of cng, 1,887,658 liters of diesel and 338,222 liters of
octane has been used.


some initiatives to reduce energy consumption

natural water cooling pads

we are using natural water cooling pads in our production floors. one side of the production
floor has cooling pads through which water flows continuously while the other side has
blower fans which “pull” and circulate the generated cool air on the floor. the room
temperature for the workers is comparatively lower than the cooling done by ceiling fans. the
need for installing hundreds of ceiling fans has been abandoned and energy consumption
has been greatly reduced. workplace comfort has also increased signiﬁcantly.


servo motors

we are using sewing machines with energy efﬁcient servo motors instead of the traditional
clutch motors in the sewing lines. servo motors consume electricity only when the machine
needle is active whereas the clutch motor consumes electricity even on standby mode. the
clutch motors are replaced as soon as the machines are out of order.

 energy management


energy efficient machineries

  igh end energy efﬁcient capital machineries from urope, us and apan are used in our
production processes. these world class machineries have greatly reduced the energy
consumption for different production processes by 15%. some of the features of our energy
efﬁcient and environment friendly machines are as follows


        the dyeing machines have individual heat recovery unit resulting in lower
        power consumption and energy saving by 15%

        water consumption saving of 20% compared to normal dyeing machines

        reduction in consumption of dyes, chemical and steam due to less water
        consumption

        heat recovery from captive power plant is providing energy saving of about 15%




                               other energy saving practices

ghgs are related with energy production and reducing energy consumption helps with
reduction of ghgs, thus contributing to minimization of climate effects.

to ensure effective monitoring and minimizing of energy consumption and ghg emission, the
following tasks are done:



            maintaining an energy use inventory (e.g. energy consumption data such as gas
            bill, electricity bill and fuel use in vehicle)

            checking electricity lines, gas lines, oil tankers and generator connections.

            maintaining ghg emission inventory including direct and indirect energy
            consumption.

 waste


all wastages are tracked and monitored regularly. non-hazardous and hazardous are given to
government authorized waste collectors for proper disposal.

different types of wastes have different ways of disposal. before disposing any waste, they
have to be categorized according to their characteristics. in general, they may be categorized
as hazardous and non-hazardous.

 grievance procedure


at dbl, we train our welfare ofﬁcers to exercise grievance procedures very professionally and
encourage employees to express their concerns without hesitation through the complaint
management system. workers feel comfortable sharing any concern that they might have
with the welfare ofﬁcers. we process grievances both formally and informally. these include:




                                             the suggestion/grievance box: workers can

                                         in the boxes. multiple boxes are placed on each floor:
                                         these are checked every week by designated people
                                         and the grievances are recorded in a register.


                                         2 tion/grievance boxes, workers can place their
                                             the bandhan newsletter: similar to the sugges-

                                         and drop them off conﬁdentially in the boxes.

                                             verbal conplaint: workers can verbally inform
                                         3 ofﬁcers from the welfare, compliance, human
                                         resource (hr), and/or admin departments or to their

                                         4     (wpc) meetings: a concerned worker can
                                         express themselves through a wpc member who
                                         will put forward the complaint during the meetings.




grievances of all employees regarding any topic are taken into account by the management.
this includes violations of rights of indigenous people. in 2015-16, there were no incidents
reported where the rights of such people were violated either through formal grievance mech-
anisms or through informal ones. dbl group’s grievance procedure addresses labor practice
issues as well as human rights and societal topics. in overall, 2015-16 recorded 143 grievanc-
es of which all were addressed and 142 resolved. 3 grievances of 2014-15 were addressed
and resolved in this year.

signiﬁcant operational changes, such as restructuring, outsourcing of operations, expan-
sions, etc., are communicated with the concerned employees a minimum of 3 months prior
to the change in order to keep everyone updated. this also gives sufﬁcient time in order to
prepare them accordingly.

risk management

given the nature of our business, the raw materials and products that we handle and the scale
of our operations, our risk management systems are designed to ensure that all our assets are
safeguarded and protected against any kind of loss including mankind and property.

in regards to the safety of workers, speciﬁc risk analyses are done based on their workplaces.
these workplaces include a wide variety of areas within the factories such as the chemical
store rooms and the etp, as well as the zones containing different machines such as the com-
pacting machine and the generator. pregnant women are also considered under risk manage-
ment: in order to avoid the risk to the fetuses, they are to be seated when working, allowed
leaving early during the lunch breaks and not allowed to work overtime.

each type of analysis includes the description and consequence of the hazard, the person at
risk and the control or preventive measures that can be taken. in addition, hazards are given
ratings, calculated by using the frequencies of occurrence and the severity, thereby effectively
identifying the risks or hazards to prioritize on.




ohsas 18001:2007 standard

the occupational health and safety advisory services (ohsas) is an international manage-
ment system speciﬁcation for occupational health and safety. implemented by giz, one of
dbl group’s dyeing units acquired this certiﬁcation in april 2016. ohsas was chosen in order
to further reduce illness and incidents through continual improvement, increase awareness
about health and safety and establish a health and safety management system within the
factory. the multi-department committee formed has enabled multiple beneﬁts including
increased hazard awareness, safety culture and reduced risk behavior. dbl is already planning
to replicate the standard to other units.

investment

signiﬁcant investment agreements include participation in training, creation and
implementation of a new policy or procedure, and other activities that dbl group undertakes
in order to promote labor practices, human rights, societal and environmental concerns, as
well as any sustainability issue. dbl has dealt with multiple activities that promote human
rights. these are summarized below.

dbl group has made investment in various training sessions. two of such programs are the
women in factories initiative (wifi) and nirapod: saving women from unwanted pregnancy
and unsafe mr. the former program is funded by walmart and implemented by care. the
latter program is phulki’s approach in partnership with the embassy of the kingdom of the
netherlands.

further details of these and other programs have been explained under chapter 2 of this
report.


forced labor

dbl does not use involuntary or forced labor. the code of conduct emphasizes that all
employees should be working at factory voluntarily and no means should be adopted as a
measure which may indirectly result in an employee working forcibly. the freedom of
movement of employees is not restricted except for the protection of property and security of
factory personnel. additionally, no employees are recruited on contract basis and an
employee may resign from the company by giving one month’s notice.


security practices

all security personnel in dbl are of our own: there are none from third party organizations.
human rights topics are communicated to all security personnel via trainings that take place
every month.


child labor

dbl is not engaged with any form of child labor. at the time of hiring, psychological interviews
are done in order to determine the age of the potential employee. in addition, documents as
proofs of age are collected from all potential employees and the authenticity of age
documents is veriﬁed. in the absence of age documents, the potential employee is to be
veriﬁed and conﬁrmed by the registered doctor available at the factory.

rather than on the basis of personal characteristics or beliefs. discrimination on any ground is
not allowed. ue to the strength of the practice, there have been no cases of discrimination.


freedom of association and collective bargaining

of association and collective bargaining. no discrimination is done against employees who
form or participate in lawful associations or collective bargaining. the presence of the worker
participation committee (wpc) allows the workers to freely communicate regarding any
issue. n order to ensure these rights are e ercised, monthly audits from the ompliance team
take place, noting the composition of the committee members, fre uency of meetings, topics
discussed and so on.          management has been able to form a              according to the
guidelines which is very effective for conveying information to both labor and management
and resolving any grievances if present.

fully sustainable company will have all its stakeholders engaged in the key processes of the
business.

directly or indirectly affected by the group’s operations are considered as stakeholders. we
identify potential stakeholders through the following process.

 committing to internal stakeholders


dbl group’s major stakeholder group and a principal asset is the workforce. hence, dbl
reserves a special importance in creating the proper work environment for all employees.
similar attention is also given to their families. to maintain a fully energized workforce, we
maintain a number of initiatives to strengthen employer-employee bonding. some are
discussed below.


workers participation committee (wpc)

collective bargaining is not prohibited in dbl group. to make a trustworthy relationship
between the workers and the company, dbl group has formed workers participation
committees. these committees constitute of representatives of both the employers and the
workers. workers are encouraged highly in forming of this committee, 50% of each committee
comprises of workers.

to promote mutual trust, understanding and cooperation between the employers and the
workers in order to fulﬁll production target, reduce production cost and improve the uality of
products, the committees meet once every month. they are working to effectively establish
privileges as well as to improve welfare services for the workers and their families. through
the wpc, workers can freely contact the committees to discuss any issue.

dbl group makes an effort to encourage good relations between workers and managers, by
hosting trainings that cover topics, such as labor standards, leave days, working hours,
wages, personal protective equipment, health and safety, environmental issues, welfare, and
so on. currently, the committees’ members are representatives of employees and top
management selected by each group respectively. however, the selection criterion is being
replaced through election procedure. ssues discussed include wages, beneﬁts, working
conditions, complaints, productivity, quality and even health issues.



effective communication procedures

dbl group has established different channels to communicate with its workers: these
include:




                                   meetings
                                   poster boards
                                   suggestion boxes
                                   open door policy

grievance mechanisms

apart from formal grievance procedures which are set up as per local laws, dbl group has
informal ways to resolve any sort of disputes quickly and effectively. the top management
has an open-door policy and grievance boxes are provided to assist employees maintain
conﬁdentiality.

dbl group has established several channels for workers to ﬁle complaints, including
anonymous complaints. these include suggestion box and an open-door policy. the welfare
ofﬁcers are responsible for handling complaints. the suggestion boxes are checked every
saturday and the grievances are recorded. appropriate action is taken and results are
reported back to the employees.


welfare officers

the welfare ofﬁcers stationed at the factory complexes oversee workers’ concerns and
problems and communicate with the human resource and other concerned departments as
required. these ofﬁcers are involved with a number of tasks as shown below. workers feel
very comfortable expressing themselves to the ofﬁcers. they handle every single case with
great care and efﬁciency and maintain conﬁdentiality depending on the sensitivity. proper
measures are taken immediately to resolve any concern over workplace or even workers’
personal issues.



roles of welfare ofﬁcers include:



                       informing workers of any changes in policies

                       dealing with complaints from workers

                       registering and providing extra care to pregnant
                       employees

                       ensuring washroom hygiene

                       coordinating and conducting trainings

                       maintaining ﬁrst aid boxes and checklists

                       facilitating meetings

the kaizen suggestion box

dbl group appreciates ideas from all of its employees. besides the suggestion/grievance
boxes, an additional box has been included with the aim of taking in suggestions from workers
that relate to improving production efﬁciency. this method provides a way to involve workers
in the decision-making process which makes workers feel important about themselves and
they highly appreciate the management for such initiative.

these boxes are referred to as “kaizen suggestion boxes” and are present in all units. these
boxes are green in color in order to help users easily identify and distinguish them. users
submit their ideas in the boxes including their names in order to be identiﬁed for recognition.


employee of the month and employee of the year

in addition to the kaizen suggestion system, efforts of our employees are also recognized
through another monthly recognition system: the “employee of the month”. in 2016, a new
recognition system, “employee of the year” was included as well. the program was
inaugurated in the knitting section and has been replicated for the others units too. these
ideas are compiled under dbl group idea club sustainability program.

a huge advantage of having an employee of the month incentive is the motivation it
encourages the employees to work at their highest potential and move them towards
empowerment. this is in terms of work performance as well as punctuality and attendance on
the job. it promotes employees to work at their full potential. the employee of the month
program is open for all employees and it gives them a feeling of fairness as every employee
has an equal opportunity at obtaining this reward.

the evaluation system also encompasses suggestions provided by employees that would
improve working procedures. the winners are provided certiﬁcates of achievements in
addition to cash incentives. moreover, their names and photos are displayed on the notice
boards of the respective units in order to further motivate them to grow in their careers and for
improving the company.
