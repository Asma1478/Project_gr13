                                                 the 10th anniversary year of masdar. this report provides a detailed update on the status of masdar’s
                                                 activities and projects globally. it also demonstrates our ongoing commitment to transparency
                                                 of information and performance data by providing a clear insight into how masdar operates and
                                                 functions.
                                                 during the decade since masdar was established, the uae has developed a global reputation
                                                 for leadership in clean technology and sustainable development. in the middle east and beyond,
                                                 there is a new emphasis on energy diversification, at a time when the growing market potential for
                                                 renewable energy is being recognized worldwide.
                                                 masdar is at the forefront of the industry’s advancement, and this report underlines how we have put
                                                 sustainability at the heart of the organisation. this includes how we drive innovation and operational
                                                 efficiency; how we support the wellbeing and growth of our people; how we invest in communities;
                                                 and how we engage with our stakeholders across the world.
                                                 the sustainability report shows that in 2016, masdar’s growing renewable energy portfolio
              mohamed jameel al ramahi           contributed significantly to the communities it serves, totaling 2.3 terawatt hours (twh) of clean
              chief executive officer - masdar   energy production, while displacing more than 1.3 million tonnes of co2 in the process.
                                                 we also continued to push the global agenda on sustainability – abu dhabi sustainability week

                                                 sustainability at a community level; and the masdar-hosted solar impulse 2 completed the first
                                                 round-the-world flight without a drop of fuel, showcasing the potential of clean technologies.
                                                 this report also details how masdar is contributing to the uae’s knowledge economy through the
                                                 development of emirati talent, providing opportunities to grow and become the leaders of tomorrow
                                                 for masdar and the united arab emirates.
                                                 as we look forward, i wish to express my gratitude to all who have contributed and supported
