      the founding of sony life

      a life insurance company carrying forward
      akio morita’s passion for “contributing to society
      by taking on challenges that others do not”
      sony life got its start in august 10, 1979, when the company was established with the core
      mission of “working for customers’ financial security and stability by offering optimal life insurance
      products and high-quality services,” aiming to revolutionize the industry.
         the founder of sony and sony life, akio morita, expressed his vision for sony life as a
      “life insurance company unlike any other in the world that matches the needs of japan.” just as
      every customer’s life is different, protection needs to be as individual as the people it is aimed for.
      the lifeplanner system was put in place to accurately determine these needs and bring extensive
      expertise and experience to bear in addressing demand based on a robust philosophy and
      strong conviction.
         at the ceremony commemorating sony life’s inauguration, akio morita addressed employees
      with the following words: “what we are trying to do here, what i am asking you to do, is to create
      a life insurance company the likes of which japan has never seen before.” this statement was in
      line with akio morita’s passion for “contributing to society by taking on challenges that others do
      not.” now more than 30 years since that time, the company’s lifeplanner sales employees have
004   earned strong customer support for the consulting services they provide. as a result, sony life’s
      total assets surpassed ¥6 trillion in fy2012, and in fy2014 the company celebrated its 35th
      anniversary of establishment. we look forward to passing forward the passion of our founder
      in the years to come.

lifeplanner sales employees
“life insurance will begin changing today. lifeplanner sales employees will drive this change.”
the concept of lifeplanner sales employees is based on the understanding that “the
people who provide life insurance designed to match the lives of individual customers need
to be professionals in the true sense of the word.” we created lifeplanner sales employees
to change the face of japan’s life insurance industry. to ensure that they are worthy of cus-
tomers’ trust, sony life’s lifeplanner sales employees undergo a variety of training pro-
grams to accumulate the necessary expertise and skills, turning them into professionals in
the areas of life insurance and finance.



consulting
accompanying customers through life’s milestones
sony life’s insurance is tailored each customer’s individual life plan. accordingly, providing
insurance requires us to determine what sort of life the customer plans to lead. we listen
carefully to a customer describe his or her dreams for the family’s future and then work with
the customer to turn those hopes into specific plans. we work together on this life plan,
calculating the necessary protection and putting in place the protection necessary to meet
the customer’s goals. to ensure that the life insurance policy is serving its intended role,
even after a policy agreement is signed, lifeplanner sales employees periodically check
protection and provide advice. if a customer’s circumstances change and some issue
arises, the individual in charge of that policyholder, as well as lifeplanner sales employees                                                            005
throughout japan, are available to assist.


reciprocal training and contribution to society
all for customers
we aim to satisfy our customers and ensure their peace of mind. to augment their
expertise and hone their skills, sony life’s lifeplanner sales employees have embraced a
culture of mutual assistance. to this end, they hold independent training forums around the
nation. evincing the success of this system, sony life represents one of the largest groups
forming the japan chapter of the million dollar round table (mdrt), with 716 people*.
furthermore, mdrt sony meets several times each year to conduct training.
  the rallying cry of sony life’s employees is “one love, one trust,” raised as they take
the initiative in social contribution activities.

                solvency margin and total risk (increasing the strictness of margin inclusion, and making risk measurement stricter and more sensitive). therefore, the figures for
                the years ended march 31, 2010 and 2011 and the figures for the years ended march 31, 2012 to 2014 are calculated based on different methods. the above-
                stated figure in [1,720.0%] as of march 31, 2011 is calculated on the assumption that these changes were applied as of march 31, 2011. the figure is also
                included in disclosures for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2011.

          based on the concept of asset liability management (alm), sony life prioritizes investment in assets having characteristics
          that match those of insurance liabilities.
             specifically, we concentrate on investment in ultralong-term jgbs with more than 10 years remaining to maturity to match
          the long-term liabilities that life insurance policies represent. in this manner, we work to appropriately control the interest rate
          risk associated with insurance liabilities. at the same time, we limit our investments in stocks and other risk assets.

      positive spread                             future payments. these policy reserves are maintained by investing under the assumption that they will yield a certain rate
                                                  of interest every year. this interest rate is called the “assumed interest rate (for calculating policy reserves).” a positive
                                                  spread occurs when the actual yield on investment exceeds the average assumed interest rate. the reverse situation
                                                  leads to negative spread, which stems from the deterioration of the investment environment or other factors.


      positive spread has continued since fy2012.
      in fy2013, the positive spread rose ¥6.3 billion year on
      year, to ¥8.4 billion, due to a decline in the average
      assumed interest rate and an increase in the investment                                             formula for calculating positive spread

    • life insurers have a profit structure in which costs are high in the initial period of a new policy, resulting in losses, and profits are made
      by recovering these costs during the period of insurance. consequently, business management cannot be accurately assessed based
      solely on results for a single fiscal year.
    • this is particularly the case during years when new policy sales are strong, as first-year policy expenses are high, reducing profit.

          providing tailored protection and extensive follow-up consultations

      our corporate slogan, “lifeplanner value,” expresses our commitment to accompanying customers through each life
      stage and helping them realize their dreams. to turn these concepts into reality, since our commencement of operations we
      have sought to provide each customer with life insurance that is optimally tailored to their individual needs, through consulta-
      tions based on life planning. even after they have taken out life insurance, we provide lifelong support to our customers,
      helping them to realize their dreams.
         we begin by conducting life planning simulation. this determines the amount of protection that a customer needs to meet
      his or her family’s dreams even if the unexpected occurs by calculating the protection amount, plotted on a timeline. even
      after the customer has entered into a policy, we conduct detailed follow-up consultations, reviewing a customer’s ongoing life
      plan and insurance coverage as circumstances change.
         sony life’s lifeplanner sales employees and partners (independent agencies) are responsible for providing such
      tailor-made protection and extensive follow-up consultations to customers.

      securing the future for our customers
      consulting-based sales and follow-up consultations
      sony life proposes insurance that is tailored to the individual life plans of its customers.
         accordingly, providing insurance requires us to determine what sort of life the customer plans to lead. we listen carefully to
      a customer describe his or her dreams for the family’s future and then work with the customer to turn those hopes into spe-
      cific plans. we work together on this life plan, calculating the necessary protection and putting in place the protection neces-
      sary to meet the customer’s goals. sony life refers to this process as providing consulting-based sales, and we have
      followed this approach diligently since the time of our establishment.




           we provide tailored protection to change lurking uncertainty into a sense of well-being.

  we recognize that the environments in which our customers live and work are always changing. to ensure that the life
insurance policy is serving its intended role, even after a policy agreement is signed, we periodically check protection and

 step 2 simulation
simulation of future income and expenses
• next, we look at the potential changes in a family’s income and expenses as they progress according to the life plan
  they have created.
• by comparing projected income and expenses on a yearly basis, we confirm whether the life plan is viable financially.
• by considering the balance between income and expenses and prioritizing expenditures, we propose realistic ways
  to make improvements.

next we run simulations to factor in the unexpected. we clarify the shortfall in the amount of money that would be
sufficient to allow the bereaved family to live comfortably in the case of untimely death.

         sony life’s proprietary system supporting
         consulting-based sales and follow-up
         consultations
         sony life introduced the c-saaf* follow-up consulting system in
         fy2012. in addition to serving as a renovated sales support system
         that centers on our pioneering lipps simulation system (see page 30)
         for life planning, the new customer management system eliminates
         the need for paper in life insurance application procedures.
            this system greatly reduces the burden to customers of the appli-
         cation process. the system also allows for the consolidated manage-

         paperless application process
         a paperless application process allows customers to confirm policy
         content on-screen and conclude the procedure by providing an
         electronic signature. this paperless process can facilitate customer
034
         understanding, as well. for example, we can indicate important items
         for emphasis, depending on the customer, and respond to any ques-
         tions that customers may have about accidents and illnesses on
         which notification is needed.
            customers can register a bank account online from which to make
         insurance premium payments, completing the paperless process.
                                                                                 filling in a paperless application


         smartphone connections to the
         customer database
         we have developed a specialized app that allows customer represen-
         tatives to use a smartphone to photograph health reports and other
         documents that customers provide during their application, and send
         this information to the company’s system. while the information is
         being sent to the system, the app simultaneously erases the docu-
         ment images from the phone. the result is enhanced security of
         sensitive data.                                                         photographing medical documents
            linking a customer representative’s smartphone with the customer
         database allows the representative to call up and refer to a custom-
         er’s policy information simply by tapping on the customer’s communi-
         cation records. this approach allows us to respond to telephone
         requests in real time and store that information in our database. we
         can thus respond securely and swiftly to customers at any time and
         from any location.

the csm system allows for the consolidated management of such
information as the life plan set forth when a policy was initially taken
out, along with any adjustments made to accommodate later
changes in conditions. this system allows sony life to conduct
long-term follow-up consultations in a timely manner.

 customer household management
we track changes in policies and life plans by household.

 consolidated management and use of customer information
in addition to the life plan drawn up when a policy is initially taken out,
the system enables detailed follow-up through the consolidated man-
agement of customer communications and procedures after that time
as well. the system also enables long-term follow-up over multiple
generations, such as from parent to child.

 timely follow-up consultations via a robust search function
   and abundant information
when customers first enter into a policy, we record information about
their life plans and requests in a database. this approach enables us
to accurately track important life events and insurance coverage, so
that we can provide them with new information specific to their
current needs and conduct more closely tailored follow-up activities.                                                                             035

 a financial adr system employs a designated third-party institution (a “designated adr institution”) to act as a fair and neutral arbiter of disputes
 that arise between a customer and a financial institution with the aim of reaching an amicable resolution without going through the courts.
    this system of resolving issues simply and quickly outside the courts is designed to provide additional protection to customers and seeks to
 enhance the level of trust that the customers place in financial products and services.
    the life insurance association of japan serves as the designated adr institution for life insurers.

          basic policy on eliminating anti-social forces
      companies are to maintain a high regard for compliance                        unequivocally. sony life’s basic policy on internal control
      and manage themselves in a manner that includes no                            system structure establishes a basic policy for eliminating
      involvement with anti-social forces. at the same time, if a                   anti-social forces, as well as for putting in place preventive
      company receives an inappropriate demand from such                            measures to isolate itself from relationships with anti-social

                                                         basic policy on eliminating anti-social forces
         we are duly aware of the importance of isolating ourselves from relationships with anti-social forces from the perspectives of social
         responsibility, compliance and corporate defense. we have in place systems to isolate ourselves from relationships with anti-social
         forces, and we reject all inappropriate demands from anti-social forces.
            we have strengthened our communications with police and other outside organizations to ensure that we are able to coordinate our
         actions and cooperate appropriately should we receive an inappropriate demand from anti-social forces. in such ways, we maintain a
         firm organizational resolve to extirpate inappropriate demands.

                     participation in social contribution activities
      “one love, one trust”
      our rallying cry is the phrase “one love, one trust,” reminding us that for each vol-
      untary contribution, or “act of love,” our standing within the community increases.

sony life volunteers provide wide-ranging support for
earthquake victims, centering on support for the senior
citizens who were affected by the great hanshin/awaji

held in different parts of japan, give children who otherwise
have little opportunity to interact with adults a chance to
participate in society. as a result, we have seen these            children participating in a beach clean-up and barbecue

        notes: 1. bankrupt and quasi-bankrupt loans are loans to borrowers who are subject to bankruptcy, corporate reorganization or rehabilitation or other similar
                  proceedings and other borrowers in serious financial difficulties.
               2. doubtful loans are loans to borrowers (other than bankrupt and quasi-bankrupt borrowers) with deteriorated financial condition and results of
                  operations from which it is unlikely that the principal and interest on the loans will be recovered.
               3. sub-standard loans are loans on which principal and/or interest are past due for three months or more (excluding loans described in notes 1. and 2.
                  above) and loans on which terms and conditions have been amended in favor of the borrowers (e.g. reduction of the original interest rate, deferral of
                  interest payments, extension of principal repayments or debt waiver) in order to support the borrowers’ recovery from financial difficulties (excluding
                  loans described in notes 1. and 2. above and loans on which principal and/or interest are past due for three months or more).
               4. normal loans are all other loans.

notes: 1. the calculating methods and ratios are set for individual life insurance and individual annuities. the concept of accumulation method is not targeted at
          policy reserves for group life insurance and group annuities, so these insurance policies are not included.
       2. the above ratios indicate the amounts of the company’s policy reserves (excluding contingency reserve) to the required premium reserves and
          unearned premiums calculated by (a) the method laid down in the ministry of finance public notice no. 48 of 1996 for policies to which the standard
          policy reserve method is applied, and (b) the net level premium reserve method for policies to which the standard policy reserve method is not applied.
          the amounts of the company’s policy reserves include policy reserves additionally reserved to maintain the future soundness of certain policies.

         5- 03 fair value information on derivative transactions (general account) (total of derivatives
                    to which hedge accounting is applied and derivatives to which hedge accounting is
                    not applied)
        qualitative information
        1. transaction details: the main derivative transactions used by sony life are as follows:
           currency derivatives: forward foreign exchange transactions
        2. transaction policy: sony life’s policy is to conduct derivative transactions for the purpose of reducing the risk associated with the held
           assets and liabilities. sony life does not engage in speculative derivatives trading.
        3. purpose of use: sony life uses derivatives for the purpose of reducing the risk associated with the held assets and liabilities. sony life
           does not apply hedge accounting to derivatives.
        4. risk details: the derivative transactions used by sony life are subject to the risk of fluctuations in market prices. however, given that
           sony life uses derivatives mainly to reduce the risk associated with the held assets and liabilities, the sum of the risk associated with
           derivative transactions and the underlying risk of assets and liabilities is limited.
             the act of trading in derivatives is intrinsically subject to credit risk. however, sony life selects counterparties who are highly unlikely to
           default on agreements related to these transactions.
        5. risk management systems: sony life’s balance of derivative transactions is within the limits that sony life has set in-house. on
           transactions conducted by the division in charge of investment, the administrative division receives reports directly from the transaction
           counterparty. this system enables the administrative division and the investment division to independently determine derivative positions
           and transaction profits and losses. in addition, the management of risks related to derivative transactions is conducted strictly by the
           department in charge of supervision. also, the risk management division regularly reports the overall risk status to the company’s board
           of directors and executive committee.
        6. supplemental information regarding quantitative information: forward foreign exchange transactions are undertaken for the purpose of
           reducing the risk of foreign exchange movements associated with foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables, etc. the
           underlying assets held and gains and losses on derivatives are recognized on a cumulative basis. sony life has confirmed that derivative
           transactions have the effect of offsetting foreign exchange movements to a certain extent.

 6- 03 fair value information on derivative transactions (company total)
qualitative information
1. transaction details: the main derivative transactions used by sony life are as follows:                                                                                       083
   currency derivatives: forward foreign exchange transactions
2. transaction policy: sony life’s policy is to conduct derivative transactions for the purpose of reducing the risk associated with the held
   assets and liabilities. sony life does not engage in speculative derivatives trading.
3. purpose of use: sony life uses derivatives for the purpose of reducing the risk associated with the held assets and liabilities. sony life
   does not apply hedge accounting to derivatives.
4. risk details: the derivative transactions used by sony life are subject to the risk of fluctuations in market prices. however, given that
   sony life uses derivatives mainly to reduce the risk associated with the held assets and liabilities, the sum of the risk associated with
   derivative transactions and the underlying risk of assets and liabilities is limited.
      the act of trading in derivatives is intrinsically subject to credit risk. however, sony life selects counterparties who are highly unlikely to
   default on agreements related to these transactions.
5. risk management systems: sony life’s balance of derivative transactions is within the limits that sony life has set in-house. on transac-
   tions conducted by the division in charge of investment, the administrative division receives reports directly from the transaction counter-
   party. this system enables the administrative division and the investment division to independently determine derivative positions and
   transaction profits and losses. in addition, the management of risks related to derivative transactions is conducted strictly by the depart-
   ment in charge of supervision. also, the risk management division regularly reports the overall risk status to the company’s board of
   directors and executive committee.
6. supplemental information regarding quantitative information: forward foreign exchange transactions are undertaken for the purpose of
   reducing the risk of foreign exchange movements associated with foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables, etc. the
   underlying assets held and gains and losses on derivatives are recognized on a cumulative basis. sony life has confirmed that derivative
   transactions have the effect of offsetting foreign exchange movements to a certain extent.

notes: 1. policy amount in force is the total of individual life insurance, individual annuities and group life insurance. policy amount for individual annuities is equal
          to the sum of (a) the funds to be held at the time annuity payments are to commence for policies for which annuity payments have not yet commenced
          and (b) the amount of policy reserves for policies for which payments have commenced.
       2. the policy amount in force for group annuities is equal to the amount of outstanding policy reserves.
       3. new policy amount is the total of individual life insurance, individual annuities and group life insurance. new policy amount for individual annuities is
          equal to the funds to be held at the time annuity payments commence.
       4. annualized premiums, which include individual life insurance and individual annuities, are converted to a per-year premium amount by multiplying
          individual premiums by a coefficient corresponding to the premium payment method. (for lump-sum payment policies, premiums are divided by the
          number of coverage years.)
       5. “medical protection, living benefit protection and other products” is the portion of the annualized premium for medical protection benefits (hospitalization
          benefits, surgical benefits, etc.) and living benefit protection (benefits for specific diseases, nursing care benefits, etc.).
       6. cabinet office ordinance no. 23 of 2010 and public notice of financial services agency no. 48 of 2010 prescribe a revision in the methods of
          calculating total solvency margin and total risk (increasing the strictness of margin inclusion, and making risk measurement stricter and more sensitive).
          therefore, the figures for the years ended march 31, 2010 and 2011 and the figures for the years ended march 31, 2012 to 2014 are calculated based
          on different methods. the above-stated figure in [1,720.0%] as of march 31, 2011 is calculated on the assumption that these changes were applied as
          of march 31, 2011. the figure is also included in disclosures for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2011.

        notes: 1. annualized premiums refer to an amount that is calculated by multiplying individual premium amounts by a coefficient that differs depending on the
                  premium payment methods, thereby converting the figure to a per-year premium. (for lump-sum payment policies, premiums are divided by the
                  number of coverage years.)
               2. “medical protection, living benefit protection and other products” indicates the portion of annualized premiums for medical protection benefits (hospital-
                  ization benefits, surgical procedure benefits, etc.) and products with living benefit protection (benefits for specific illness, nursing care benefits, etc.).

notes: 1. the “policies to which nursing care applies, ending at death of policyholder” column shows the amount receivable for nursing care or upon death. the
          number of years elapsed is the number through november 2, 2014.
       2. the above-stated dividend amount is the sum of the pro-rated dividend amount (policy reserve × dividend participation ratio) and interest through
          november 2, 2014 (excluding dividends already paid).
          dividend participation ratio = standard dividend yield – assumed interest rate

3. standard dividend yield on group annuities
the standard dividend yield on group annuities is 1.30%, using figures for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014.
note: dividend participation is calculated as follows:
      dividend amount = policy reserves × dividend participation ratio
      dividend participation ratio = standard dividend yield – assumed interest rate
4. for group term life insurance and other products, a reserve for policyholders’ dividends is accumulated in accordance with each
   product’s characteristics.

         4 indicators related to asset management (general account)
         4- 01 overview of asset management (general account)
        overview of the asset management for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014
        (1) investment environment
        during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014, the japanese economy continued to grow. in the first half, public investment as well as
        exports showed sizable growth thanks to the government’s economic stimulus package and the still depreciating yen. in addition, private
        consumption was solid thanks to the improvement in consumer confidence supported by the buoyant stock market. in the second half,
        there was a last-minute surge in demand in view of the coming consumption tax hike from april 2014, resulting in substantial increases in
        the sales of durable goods and private housing investment. while the real gdp growth rate temporarily stalled at one stage due to a decel-
        eration of the growth momentum in public investment and exports, which have been driving the economy, it proved to be generally solid
        throughout the fiscal year.
          the real gdp growth rate, year on year, was 2.9% for the april–june quarter of last year, 1.3% for the july–september quarter, 0.3% for
        the october–december quarter, and 6.7% in the january–march quarter.
          the japanese bond market remained under the strong influence of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing policy of the bank of
        japan (boj) implemented in april last year. as the boj announced that it would double in two years the monetary base, as well as its hold-
        ing of long-term japanese government bonds (jgbs) and exchange traded funds (etfs), while more than doubling the period of the aver-
        age remaining maturity of its long-term jgbs, concern grew over the potential decline of market liquidity immediately after the introduction
        of this new boj policy, triggering temporary interest rate volatility. on the other hand, since the boj announced “it would aim to realize the
        two percent consumer price stability target, and continue its quantitative and qualitative monetary easing until such time the japanese
        economy can maintain a two percent inflation rate over the long term,” the interest rate rise in the short and mid-term maturity sector
        turned out to be limited thanks to the time axis effect, which in turn spread to the long-term maturity sector, slightly reducing interest rate
        volatility in the bond market. as the market settled down in the period up to the fiscal year-end, the interest rate was on a gradual decline
        trend. the yield on 10-year jgbs, which is the bellwether for the long-term interest rate, went down to 0.325% at one point in april 2013,
        then soared up to 0.996% at one point in may 2013, before it declined to 0.642% (up 0.082 of a percentage point year on year) at the end
        of march 2014.
          the japanese stock markets soared. the nikkei stock average went up from ¥12,397.91 at the end of march 2013 to ¥15,942.60 in the
        middle of may 2013, encouraged by the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing policy by the boj implemented in april last year, along
        with the government’s growth strategies. then the index went down to a level below the ¥13,000 mark in a correction phase, discouraged
        by tapering quantitative easing in the u.s. and concern over emerging economies, before a recovery trend gradually prevailed on the back
        of solid domestic corporate earnings. as of march 31, 2014, the nikkei stood at ¥14,827.83, up ¥2,429.92 from its level a year earlier.
          in foreign exchange markets, the yen further depreciated. the dollar to yen exchange rate soared from ¥94.22 against the u.s. dollar at
        the end of march 2013, to ¥103.74 against the u.s. dollar at one point in may 2013, encouraged by the quantitative and qualitative mone-
        tary easing policy of the boj implemented in april last year. then investors bought back yen in a risk-off market sentiment, discouraged by
        tapering quantitative easing in the u.s. and growing geopolitical tension, resulting in the yen appreciating against the u.s. dollar to around

the ¥94 level at one point, before soaring again beyond ¥100 through the period into the second half, encouraged by developments in the
u.s., including the economic recovery and the agreement between the ruling and opposition parties over the debt ceiling issues. this trend
of a weak yen has generally prevailed to date, and the yen was trading at ¥103.23 against the u.s. dollar as of march 31, 2014, weakening
¥8.97 against the u.s. dollar from a year earlier.
(2) investment policy
sony life’s investment policy is to understand the characteristics of insurance liabilities, and prioritize investment in the assets that meet
such characteristics based on the concept of alm (asset liability management, the comprehensive management of assets and liabilities).
specifically, sony life is investing primarily in ultra long-term jgbs with longer remaining maturity, to meet the long-term liabilities of life
insurance policies, in an effort to maintain adequate control over the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations involved in such
insurance liabilities. on the other hand, it is our policy to invest within certain limits in riskier assets including stocks.
(3) results of investment
as of march 31, 2014, general account assets totaled ¥5,984.3 billion, up 10.8%, or ¥582.2 billion, from a year earlier. within general
