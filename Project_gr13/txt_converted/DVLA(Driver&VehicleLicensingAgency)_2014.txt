purpose of this document
this report details dvla’s performance against the greening government commitments and
our overall sustainability performance. it is intended to supplement the summary included in
the main body and annex a of dvla’s annual report and accounts 2013-2014. the annex of
this report consists of detailed tables containing the minimum reporting requirements in
accordance with the hm treasury sustainability reporting guidance 2013-14 and the greening
government commitments guidance.

boundary
the accounting boundary of this sustainability report matches the financial reporting
boundaries of the annual report. it includes data related to our main site and the network
offices. closed network office sites that we continue to hold the leases for are also included.

pfi contract
whilst our pfi contract carries out business on our behalf for activities such as waste and
energy management, we have assumed direct control of these for the purposes of annual
reporting. this is mainly because we maintain financial responsibility for the paying of the utility
bills and have significant influence over how these activities are carried out.

omissions, estimates and amendments to prior periods
there are no known omissions in the data set provided. where estimates have been used
and/or amendments have been made to previously reported data, these are noted in the
accompanying text.

       greening government commitments



dvla's objectives and targets stem from the greening government commitments (ggcs). the
ggcs were set as a means to achieve the government’s vision; to have the greenest ever
operations and procurement with greater transparency on performance. the commitments aim
to significantly reduce the government’s negative impact on the environment through reducing
emissions of greenhouse gases, reducing waste, reducing water consumption and making public
procurement more sustainable. the targets cover the period from 2009/2010 to 2014/2015
with the first year as the baseline measurement.

1
  there has been a change to all previously reported figures for greenhouse gas emissions in-line with current guidance from
defra concerning the recalculated conversion factors for electricity. all conversion factors are now based on a single average
factor for the particular year (previously a 5 year rolling average).

whilst we are slightly behind on this year’s dft reduction target we are on track to meet the
three main greening government commitments which come to an end in 2014/15.

the greenhouse gas emissions have further reduced over the past twelve months. we
achieved a reduction of 7.7% this year above the 5% reduction expected.

the energy saving measures we have implemented this year include:

        installation of led lighting in areas to increase efficiency of energy use.
        installation of thermal jacket insulation jackets on pipe work.

plans and proposals for the coming year and beyond which will assist in the successful
achievement of the ggcs’ 2014-2015 25% reduction target include:

        an assessment of the way in which we manage our energy across the whole estate
         including reviewing the way in which we utilise our chps.

        further consideration for photovoltaic (pv) solutions for our whole estate.

to keep on track with the 2014/15 ggc target, our parent department (dft) set us the aim of
achieving a 20% reduction by this year from the baseline of 2009/10.


we had only expected to achieve half of this target due to the programme of work to close our
local offices (completed in december 2013) meant an increase in our business travel and dual
running of some of our operations. however, we exceeded our initial forecast with a 15.25%
reduction. we believe that both the energy efficiency projects that have taken place on our
main site, and the early release of some of the lsn site leases have assisted us in exceeding
where we planned to be. the closure of our local office network has provided a significant
decrease in energy use and the full benefit of this restructure will be realised when all the
leases have come to an end.

the chart above shows how we are improving the carbon efficiency of our business. we began
by increasing our transactions whilst decreasing our ghg emissions. it is our intention to
continue this trend with our plans for improving the efficiency of the estate and exploring
options for the use of renewable energy technology.

   waste minimisation and management



during 2013/14 we continued to further reduce our waste and are on course to exceed our
2014-2015 waste minimisation targets. we are likely to achieve in excess of a 40% reduction in
waste from the 2009/10 base line year.

our biggest success with waste management this year was the significant amount of waste we
diverted from landfill with the closure of our local offices. we reused as much as we could
within our agency, what we couldn’t reuse or store for future use we shared with other
government agencies, charities, community groups and schools, not for profit organisations,
start up businesses, libraries and hospitals. the data we have points to a minimum of 119
organisations benefiting from the donations and we can confidently estimate that over 90% of
potential waste from the office closures was diverted from landfill by being reused or recycled.

       finite resource consumption


water use
we continue to achieve good practice consumption figures for our water consumption at 4m³
per fte (good practice is between 4-6m³ per fte).

however we are aware the overall water consumption on our main site is increasing despite
waterless urinals and low flow toilets, this we believe is due to the increasing levels of staff due
to the dual operation running discussed earlier. we are currently considering ways to reduce
water consumption further.

to supplement the water we are supplied, we also harvest rainwater at two of our sites. this
year we collected 618 cubic metres which we use towards flushing our toilet facilities.

administrative paper
a one-off target was set across government to reduce administrative paper consumption in
2010-2011 by 10% from 2009-2010 levels. the agency achieved a 47% reduction in 2011-2012.
our consumption in this area has continued to fall with a 61% reduction from 2009-2010 levels
estimated for 2013-14.

operational paper

dvla strategy to increase our digital services will mean a significant reduction in paper usage.
for example we have estimated that the abolition of the tax disc and the move to direct debit
payment methods will save in excess of the equivalent of 50 million pieces of paper (or
approximately 6000 trees per annum) and estimated financial savings of nearly £167m over the
next 10 years. for more information on this please refer to the business plan 2014 to 2015.
other efficiency savings planned for the coming year are the abolition of the paper counterpart
driving licence and the option for fleet operators not to hold vehicle registration certificates.
each will allow us to significantly reduce our volume of operational paper.

  transparency commitments



the greening government commitments also include demonstrating transparency in related
matters. the ggcs state that the ‘government has committed to be open and transparent on
the areas below, to increase accountability and to lead by example’. the following paragraphs
summarise some of the highlights of the work we are doing in each of the five areas of the
transparency commitments.



sustainable procurement
all common goods and services are procured by the crown commercial service (css), acting as
a delivery agent, on behalf of the agency. the framework agreements/contracts established by
the ccs include a full range of sustainable products that meet the government buying
standards (gbs). the gbs are easy-to-use product specifications, enabling public authorities to
develop tenders which procure sustainably.
as part of pre-procurement activity (i.e. preparation) for all procurement exercises, including
common goods and services procured by the ccs, the agency undertakes a sustainable risk
assessment on all requirements. this assessment is intended to ensure that environmental,
social and economic (sustainability) issues are assessed, understood and managed in all key
commercial decisions that relate to the procurement of goods and services.

at present we do not capture supply chain emissions but an essential part of the tender process
is to ensure that we are clear about the sustainable requirements we place on suppliers in
order to influence their performance in this area.

climate change adaptation
our latest climate change risk assessment has identified just one major risk to our business- a
potential flood risk at our swansea vale site. the local council are currently carrying out
mitigating actions and as a business we have developed a continuity plan to ensure our
resilience against this possible impact.

bio-diversity and the natural environment
as an agency, we have a legal requirement as well as a commitment under the ggcs to report
on and have regard to biodiversity. encouraging and enhancing biodiversity not only has a
positive impact on the natural environment, but also on dvla employees and our surrounding
neighbours’ quality of life through aspects including health and well-being.

the agency’s first biodiversity action plan was published in 2012/13. activities progressed this
year as part of the action plan include:

      installing bird boxes on main site (donated by our pfi service provider telereal trillium)
       to encourage a larger bird population.

      changing the grass cutting regime on 2 sites to allow a more natural growth pattern to
       exist.

      changing the planting list to only allow planting of native species with a view to
       encouraging more wildlife.

      undertaking a small mammal survey.

      liaison with the south wales amphibian and reptile conservation trust to help improve
       the habitat surrounding our pond and conservation area.


food and catering services
dvla’s private finance initiative (pfi) contract with telereal trillium for food and catering
services is sub contracted to elior uk. during 2013 elior uk were awarded platinum status in
the bitc corporate responsibility index 2013 for their focused commitment on sustainable
business practices.

their new ‘you & life’ scheme promotes healthy eating values and enables people to make
healthier choices by, for example, offering undressed salad bar choices and ensuring that low in
sugar and low in fat products (including spreads, baked beans, mayonnaise and yoghurts) are
used as standard.

elior’s procurement policy is based on supporting uk farmers and growers through a regional
and local supply chain and where they are unable to buy locally they take account of welfare

and sustainable guidelines such as marine conservation society’s “fish to eat” and “fish to
avoid” lists and the red lion certification for eggs.

more information on elior uk can be found on their website.



sustainable construction
we have not engaged in any construction work during the last financial year. all minor projects
have required waste to be recycled wherever possible.



people


at dvla we are committed to being a responsible business and understand that we have a
responsibility to support the people that work with us and the communities in which we work.

over the past year we have undertaken many activities to support our staff and communities,
below is a snap shot of some of these.


      health and well being

   the agency actively promotes a healthy lifestyle and has a focus on sustaining a healthy
   working environment in support of building a high performance culture and management.
   the “changing minds” and “fit for the future” campaigns delivered a number of initiatives
   tailored to the needs of staff in support of physical and mental wellbeing. our work on
   mental wellbeing has been showcased as best practice across the civil service and beyond
   with a case study on dvla featuring in the annual report of the good day at work
   wellbeing network.

      volunteering

   the agency complies with our parent departments’ policy to allow staff to take paid special
   leave to volunteer. the agency has not proactively endorsed any volunteering schemes, but
   it will be reviewing its approach in this area over the next 12 months.

   staff engagement

the civil service people survey 2013 produced an overall engagement score of 56% in
dvla, this is an increase of 2% from the previous cs people survey held in 2012. while the
headline score showed a positive move, some clear steps were identified to improve staff
engagement. the agency has taken note of this feedback as well as that from the investors
in people reviews of 2010 and 2013. leading and managing were identified as our key driver
of engagement and much of the agency’s planning has been focussed on these areas.

   work experience

dvla completed its participation in the government’s ‘get britain working’ work placement
programme which is a programme designed to offer work experience to unemployed
people who are claiming job seekers allowance and who have volunteered for work
experience. a total of 356 people participated in the programme and analysis undertaken
by dwp in 2013 revealed that 53% of these successfully found paid work, some of which
were posts in dvla.

   diversity

to increase our staff’s representation from the black and minority ethnic (bme) job market
a number of activities have taken place. a bme targeted job fair took place in december;
attendees were encouraged to register onto civil service jobs with a view to applying for
dvla job opportunities. in addition, an ongoing work placement initiative primarily with
disabled support groups has been extended to bme support groups.

   community

as part of our contribution to our local community, the agency created a scheme called
‘getting swansea online’. these events were designed to help people who have little or no
experience of using the internet get hands on experience and support. the agency teamed
up with a local school to help teach skills such as how to setting up email accounts, learning
how to talk to friends and family across the internet and uploading and sending digital
photos.

this year has also seen staff nominate a local ‘charity of choice’ to receive the fruits of our
fundraising efforts. the first charity to be supported is the wales air ambulance, with the
first few events raising over £5000 for the charity.
