                chairman & managing director’s message




dear stakeholders,
at bhel, sustainable development is not new. during all the
fty years since our incorporation, we have been leveraging
technology and innovation for providing products, systems and
services to our customers to enable them to use resources with
better efciency and productivity.
the relationship between bhel, its products, its
employees, its customers and the society is - to use the
unavoidable metaphor - is like a river, the deeper it gets the less noise
it makes. it has been just a natural extension of the way we saw ourselves and our responsibility. it has
always been a way of our doing business. it’s an entrenched part of our history, how we have been
consistently making prots since 1971-72 through the principles of sustainability at every stage.
with rst order for 500 mw in 1978, 660 mw and 800 mw in 2008 and 700 mw in 2010, we have
been progressively introducing environment friendly and fuel efcient technologies and continuing
to work with a mission of providing sustainable business solution to our customers. as
decarburising power sector is at the heart of global efforts to make deep cuts in global co2
emissions, bhel is committed to offer sustainable technologies and products to its customers. it is
a matter of pride that during 2013-14, the rst bhel make 660 mw supercritical unit was
commissioned for ntpc at barh and rst 800 mw boiler was synchronised for appdcl at
krishnapatnam.
bhel is committed to its innovation-led growth strategy. during the year, bhel invested ₹ 1,114
crore on r&d - 2.76% of the turnover and also led 434 patents and copyrights, enhancing the

company’s intellectual capital to 2,589, which are in productive use. many of these projects are
focused towards providing cleaner technologies suitable for the future markets.
in fact, on the sustainability dimension, bhel has a much higher responsibility in delivering
products that enable all its customers service the society in a socially and ecologically acceptable
way, while remaining protable. we empower our customers in this endeavour by offering
equipment with better performance attributes like lower auxiliary power consumption, better plant
heat rate & plf and nally lower life cycle cost. according to a report for benchmarking of
operational efciency parameters, bhel supplied sets show superior performance in comparison
to that from other global suppliers.
as always, our customers join us, challenge us, engage with us, and help us do it better.
considering that availability of adequate land for future power projects would come at a premium,
we have started to work on optimized plant layouts to reduce the power-plant footprint. similarly to
address the scarcity of water we are engineering power plants that would use lesser water by
incorporating air cooled condensers, etc.
therefore, our company has not just implemented sustainability measures in our own plants but is also
through jointly working with our customers to change the world for the better.
bhel is committed to follow the best corporate governance practices in all its pursuits, aligning with
its economic, social and environmental objectives. we manage all affairs of our company in an
ethical and transparent manner and communicate truthfully with all our stakeholders. bhel
operates with the ultimate objective of creating wealth and to enhance shareholder value in the
long term.



                                                                                  (b. prasada rao)

                           message from director (hr)


                             dear stakeholders,
                             it is with immense pride and pleasure that i place before you bhel’s
                             annual sustainability report. the report is a reection upon some of our
                             key activities for the 2013–2014 scal year related to sustainable
                             development and provides an opportunity for us to share our
                             achievements, recognize where we need to further advance our
                             efforts, and provide insight into where we are going as an organization.
                               bhel believes that while governance for sustainability, stakeholder
                               engagement and disclosure on sustainability issues forms the bedrock
                               for embedding sustainability within the corporate dna, the
                               organizational performance on environmental and social issues linked
with its business is the ultimate measure for sustainability.
any successful initiative requires being loaded with enabling structures right from the beginning.
for sustainable development, a guiding force has been created in the form of a ‘sustainable
development policy’ and enabling framework in terms of board level committee (blc) for csr &
sustainability has been formed. blc mentors the journey in terms of transforming and translating
vision of the organization in line with the mission and policy whereas nodal ofcers at each
manufacturing unit’s level conforms to the vision in shaping the manufacturing unit towards a
common future. the blc is supported by corporate hse group which acts as an enabler to provide
unwavering support to the units for meeting the objective set out by the blc in measurable terms.
to address the environmental sustainability, bhel takes up several environmental improvement /
sustainable development projects which enables our organization to minimize our environmental
footprint. a 5 mwp solar power plant at ranipet is a hallmark in our efforts towards ensuring
environmental sustainability. to address the challenges being faced by our society, bhel has
developed its csr programme which is focused to contribute towards broader objective of
achievement of social equity. these efforts have been captured by corporate hse group in this
report.
going forward, it is overall a testing time for power sector players in india. however, with the pool of
human resource having such a vast work experience and having an enabling framework in place,
we are bound to persevere and tide over these tough times and take our organization ahead in the
path of sustainability. i invite your feedback for making our future sustainability report more rened.

% of water drawl for the same period. all the
water quality related parameters were within
the prescribed limit of discharge as specied
by the respective state pollution control board
at the locations of our units.
further, water recycling / reuse is being
practiced at our unit in a big way. the data for
water recycle / reuse at our units is shown in
the gure below. the water is mainly being
recycled in the processes and reused for
horticulture purposes.
as can be seen from the gure, there has
been a signicant increase in recycling /
reuse of water in the reporting period. this is
mainly because of heightened emphasis on
using recycled / reused water in the bigger
units like trichy, bhopal and haridwar which
taken together account for almost 86% of
water uses in bhel.

it shows that there has been signicant
improvement in our carbon avoidance
activities and the data is further likely to
improve in near term. a major portion in this
saving has come from activities taken at

uses of ozone depleting substances in
refrigerators and chillers are being phased
out from our units and at many a places it
has been stopped altogether. the quantity of
ods used was 282 kg cfc-11 equivalent
which was lesser than the amount of ods
used (307.88 kg cfc-11 equivalent) during
2012-13. the new machines purchased in
many of our units are using refrigerants like
r-134a, r-410a etc. which are more
environment friendly.
