aiming for a society in
which all people receive
appropriate health care
around the world, people are unable to receive appropriate health care for many reasons, including poverty and
insufficient healthcare environments and systems. access to healthcare is one item targeted in the sustainable
development goals (sdgs) adopted by the united nations in 2015. being a healthcare company, sysmex considers
this an important issue. to ensure that as many people as possible have access to appropriate healthcare, we
engage in healthcare enhancement initiatives by cooperating with local governments, international institutions,
medical institutions, companies and other entities, and by promoting the provision of healthcare opportunities.




     relation to the sdgs
     the sustainable development goals (sdgs) adopted by the united nations consist of 17 goals to be
     met by 2030. goal 3, to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,” targets the
     following objectives.

     this was an effective program for achieving improvements in laboratory quality.
     under this program, training on laboratory quality enhancement was provided to us as members of staff at the namibia institute
     of pathology. our institute has been assigned by the namibian government to control the management of clinical laboratory
     operations.

     we had the opportunity to learn about quality control systems for clinical laboratories that match international standards, which
     was very meaningful. we also learned about accurate operations and applied knowledge, and reconfirmed the objectives and
     significance of testing, which raised the overall level of staff interest in hematology testing. i think this program will help raise the
     level of quality in clinical testing.

embracing diversity
and creating a culture
of innovation
efforts to promote diversity and initiatives aimed at making the workplace motivating and work meaningful have
drawn increasing attention in recent years, and the united nations’ sustainable development goals (sdgs) raise
gender equality and decent work in their targets.

sysmex considers human resources an important management resource for achieving sustainable growth, and we
have evolved from the practice of “diversity,” which simply welcomes diverse human resources, to the more
extensive practice of “diversity and inclusion.” this approach involves creating a working environment that is
suitable for a wide variety of human resources. through synergies arising from different values, perspectives,
experiences and capabilities, we are working to create a culture of innovation and generate value.


     relation to the sdgs
     the sustainable development goals (sdgs) adopted by the united nations are comprised of 17 goals to be met
     by 2030. goal 5, to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls,” and goal 8, to “promote
     sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for
     all,” call for the realization of the following.

     ●eliminating discrimination against all women in its various forms
     ●ensuring women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of
      decision-making in political, economic and public life.
     ●introducing and reinforcing appropriate policies and binding rules for promoting gender equality and
      enhancing the capabilities of all women
     ●achieving full and productive employment and decent work for all people, and equal pay for work of
      equal value

   comment                  comment from an employee who participated in a diversity round table

     this was a good chance to re-evaluate and consider my future working style.
     i took part in a round table for female employees with elementary school children. it was easy to
     relate to the accounts of experiences by other women working in the same company on topics such
     as how to find time for communication when parents’ and children’ s lives are on different schedules,
     and mental attitudes and creative twists for working parents. also, through the program related to
     the career experiences of female managers, i realized the importance to my own future career of
     being confident in myself, taking advantage of my own strengths, and not being afraid to charge                        naomi ooi
                                                                                                                         global support division
     ahead toward areas of interest even if i make mistakes. the people working in this company live in
                                                                                                                          sysmex corporation
     many different circumstances, and i look forward to participating again in this round table to think
     about my future working style and enjoy a situation that makes it easy to consider all sorts of things.

   comment                comment from an employee involved with the establishment of sysmex harmony

     i aim to foster ties with the local community and create a pleasant workplace.
     sysmex harmony was established with the aim of helping to realize an inclusive society in hyogo
     prefecture. creating a workplace where people with disabilities could utilize their skills has been a
     long time issue for sysmex corporation. we didn’ t have the skill related to building such company,
     so there were many tasks to do. we had many things to consider, such as what types of work the
     employees could handle and what sort of care was needed. we were able to start preparing due to
     support from related departments, the people at hyogo prefecture’ s public employment security                         motohiko nakano

     office and social welfare corporations. as we move forward, we will focus on the concept of

in relation to aging populations in advanced countries, in recent years the need has been
growing to reduce healthcare costs and extend healthy lifespans. at the same time, the
establishment of medical infrastructure is unable to keep pace with growing populations in
emerging markets and developing countries, and some 400 million people around the world
are not receiving necessary levels of healthcare*. boosting access to healthcare services is
therefore an issue.

meanwhile, the sustainable development goals (sdgs) adopted by the united nations in
september 2015 set targets for human health and welfare, prompting growing
expectations for global companies to undertake initiatives to resolve medical issues.

under these conditions, the in vitro diagnostics (ivd) domain, which plays an important role
in disease prevention, early detection and determining courses of treatment, is expected to
contribute to a healthy society by creating new value and solving healthcare issues,
including the three most deadly infectious diseases (hiv/aids, tuberculosis, malaria).

* source: who “universal health coverage”




in line with our mission of “shaping the advancement of healthcare,” which is deﬁned in the
“sysmex way,” the corporate philosophy of the sysmex group, we are working to create
new value in the ivd ﬁeld. we believe our mission is to address the shared desire of people
around the world to remain healthy.

in particular, resolving healthcare issues and improving access to healthcare through our
business activities are linked with creating new technological and social value, thereby
contributing to a sustainable society.

since the time of our founding, we have expanded our product lineup and strengthened
our services and support in response to testing needs, working to provide accurate test
data swiftly. in recent years, we have been conducting research and development to create
advanced, high-value testing and diagnosis technologies with a view to realizing
personalized medicine. to boost access to healthcare in emerging markets and developing
countries, we are promoting business activities aimed at raising local levels of healthcare.

by leveraging the unique technologies we have cultivated to date, as well as our global
network, we will continue to contribute toward the development of healthcare and the
healthy lives of people.
