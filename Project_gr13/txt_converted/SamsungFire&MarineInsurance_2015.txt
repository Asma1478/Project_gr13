ceo message                                                  04




               in 2015, based on our business principle to

              “establish sound management through change,

               innovation and action”, we will lay a strong

               foundation to make a new leap forward to

               become a global insurer.

                                                                                                                      05




dear stakeholders,

first of all, i would like to express my sincere appreciation for your kind interest and cordial support rendered
to us during the years to date. this sustainability report includes trustworthy information regarding
our general business status in accordance with the global reporting initiative g4 guideline. it has been five years
since we first published our sustainability report, and through this fifth sustainability report, i am delighted
to share with you our company’s updates on overall business status during last year.

looking back on 2014, korean economy underwent uneasy situation due to economic slowdown in developed
countries, with the exception of the us market, on top of the increasing economic uncertainties stemming
from emerging markets such as china and russia. despite these hardships, sfmi achieved net profit of
krw 838.2 billion based on our management principle of ‘profitable growth’ that we believe is to enhance
overall corporate value and hence beneficial to our stakeholders as well. also, we consistently maintained
our rbc (risk-based capital) ratio, a key measure for financial stability of insurance companies,
up to 375% - the highest level in the industry.

reflecting sound evaluation from investors and financial communities, our share price marked its highest
record, and a.m. best company, a world-renowned credit rating agency for insurance companies, rated
our company the highest rating, a++, for four consecutive years. at the same time sfmi has become a valued
member of the leading sustainability indices across the globe such as djsi world and ftse4good of
the london stock exchange.

in 2015, we will devote us to lay a solid foundation to jump up to be a global insurance company,
based on the management philosophy of “change; innovation; and implementation.”

in order for us to reach this goal, our immediate next steps are as follows:

first, we will further strengthen our customer-oriented business and expand our customer base.

second, we will continue our efforts toward efficient work processes and consolidate the company’s profitability.

third, we will explore future growth opportunities in korean health insurance market, and gradually expand
into overseas markets as a way of securing our new future growth engines.

i look forward to your continued interest in our company and in our journey to leap forward as a global insurance
company in the near future, and i hope all the best wishes for you and your families.

thank you very much.

sincerely yours,


                                                                                                          june 2015

                    operation of sustainability management committee

                    sustainability management committee, headed by our ceo, was established in 2012 to reinforce the
                    foundation of sustainability management. in 2014, the committee discussed various issues relating
                    to socially responsible management policies such as environment management and also approved
                    the sustainability report.

materiality    sfmi’s sustainability report focuses on key material issues, both internal and external, which we
               have determined as material to corporate management and to our stakeholders according to gri g4
matters        guidelines




[ g4-18 ]      process of determining issues
               step 1, identifying: to identify material sustainability issues that may affect our business, we have conducted
               in depth analysis of domestic and international sustainability management trends and guidelines, (gri g4
               and iso26000, etc.), changes in domestic policies and press releases associated with sfmi and the insurance
               industry. we have determined 22 issues as material.

               step 2, prioritizing: materiality test is conducted for the identified issues based on the sfmi’s significance of
               economic, environmental, and social impacts and influence on stakeholder assessment and decisions. opinions
               of our employees and of external experts were reflected when assessing the significance of economic,
               environmental, and social impacts, and analyses of press releases and survey results were reflected in
               assessing social impacts and influence on stakeholder.

               step 3, review & approval: the issues are internally reviewed and approved by the sustainability management
               committee. we have made utmost efforts to cover all the material issues in this sustainability report.

corporate            sfmi conducts transparent and responsible management based on advanced, board-centered
                     corporate governance. the board of directors promotes creative management with the ultimate goal
governance           of maximizing corporate value. every effort is made to enhance shareholder value and right through
                     transparent, stakeholder focused management.




principle & policy   stable governance: to maintain mutual checks and balances between the corporate bodies, roles of the
                     board of directors and company executive are separated. the bod is responsible for company management
                     oversight, while the executives are responsible for managing operations. all operational results are announced
                     and approved by the bod. additionally, to ensure appropriate checks and balances, bod retains the right to
                     the selection, succession and dismissal of the ceo as prescribed by relevant laws. as of december 2014, sfmi’s
                     board of directors consists of seven directors including three inside directors and four outside directors. the
                     greater outside director representation ensures the balance of interest of the board.

                     efficient governance: sfmi’s bod members are from diverse professional background allowing them to
                     combine a broad spectrum of experience and expertise in the decision making. the diverse knowledge and
                     opinions of the members are shared during the regular bod meetings, reinforcing efficient decision making
                     capacity of the board.

                     transparent governance: key elements of sfmi’s corporate governance concerning the guidelines, process,
                     resolutions and the activities of the bod are disclosed in the business report and through the financial
                     supervisory service’s electronic disclosure system.

                     sfmi’s corporate governance complies with all applicable rules and regulations as we continue to foster
                     responsible management based on principles of corporate governance.




composition and      bod
characteristics      the board of directors fully supports the company executives to implement responsible management based on
                     sound corporate governance. as such, the bod helps to make importance management decision by addressing
                     issues related to management operations, guidelines and process. the board of directors holds regular
                     meetings based on its annual operation plans. extraordinary meetings may be convened upon request of the
                     chairman or the bod or at occurrence of special events associated with company management. decisions are

              contribution to the company and shareholders.

              set based on sustainability values such as long term performance, profitability and soundness. majority of the
              total compensation payable to senior management is composed of variable payments and is determined based
              on performance evaluation. the variable compensation is paid over 3 years. substantial portion of the variable
              remuneration is linked to long term performance and while the first year remuneration is paid in cash, 2nd-3rd
              year compensation is paid in form of equity linked products.

overview          risk management committee: as a sub-committee within the bod, the risk management committee defines
                  tolerable risk levels for both underwriting and asset management operations and establishes risk management
                  guidelines that are reflected in companywide business decision making. the committee also promotes the
                  importance of risk management to executive managements.

                  cro (chief risk officer): the cro operates the risk management committee and attends the product
                  committee and the asset management committee to oversee risk management across company business.

                  risk management department: insurance risk management division and the asset risk management division
                  operate under the cro and are in charge of assessing, monitoring and controlling risk. the divisions are
                  separate from each other to ensure their independence.

management of      sfmi maintains the highest capital adequacy within korean non-life insurance industry. we have formulated
capital adequacy   an internal capital solvency calculation method based on global solvency ii standard, to determine our capital
                   adequacy and set internal risk tolerance level.

                   regulatory capital solvency requirements: solvency ratio of an insurance company refers to capital available in
                   addition to capital required for insurance companies to pay back to policyholders (required capital). as of de-
                   cember 2014, sfmi’s rbc ratio stood at 375%, well exceeding the 100% level required by the financial supervi-
                   sory services.

                   internal capital solvency requirements and risk tolerance limit: to implement a more effective risk manage-
                   ment framework, we measure our internal solvency ratio based on solvency ii standards. our risk manage-
                   ment committee monitors risk tolerance level and adequacy of the limit on a regular basis.

                   stress test and sensitivity analysis: sfmi conducts annual stress test based on the imf bailout and 2008 global
                   financial crisis scenarios, as set by the regulators. the results of the test are reported to the risk management
                   committee. based on our recent stress test, our solvency ratio was at 200%, an adequate level even when ap-
                   plied the economic crisis scenario. we also perform market fluctuation sensitivity analysis to measure risks that
                   may lead to profit and asset losses.

                   * imf crisis scenario: 30% increase in interest rate, 40% decline in stock prices, 50% decline in exchange rates, 100% increase in bankruptcy rate, etc.

business continuity   in preparation for potential business interruptions arising from by disasters such as fire, gas explosion,
managements           rainstorm or war crisis, sfmi established a business continuity plan to ensure quick recovery of our business
                      and to mitigate risks for our stakeholders. sfmi was first in the non-life industry to acquire bs25999
                      certification in 2010 and iso22301 certification in 2013.

business results   overview
                   in fy 2014, uncertainties over the global financial markets have continued owing to delayed economic
                   recovery of developing countries and concern with drop of oil price. while the local economy, entering into a
                   new-normal period marked with low growth and low interest rate, continued to experience weak domestic
                   demand. despite this challenging environment, sfmi achieved solid business results by promoting high profit
                   and solid growth. direct premiums written rose to krw 17.4 trillion, 1.8% more than the previous year, while
                   net profit rose to krw 796.6 billion, 12.4% more by dint of improved portfolio mix and differentiated profit
                   management throughout all business lines. rbc ratio which shows the financial soundness of an insurer
                   recorded the industry’s highest level of 375.1%. sfmi also received an “a + positive” rating from global credit
                   rating agency s&p and an “a++ (superior)” from a.m.best, demonstrating its high creditability and world’s top
                   class financial soundness.


                   profit & loss summary
                   direct premiums written and net premiums earned rose 1.8% and 2.0% respectively compared to the previous
                   year recording krw 17.3 trillion and 16.6 trillion each.
                   underwriting profit posted a loss of krw 592.5 billion due to concentrated large amount incidents of
                   commercial insurance and a deteriorated loss ratio of auto insurance and higher risk loss ratio of long-term
                   insurance from additional ibnr reserves. despite decline of yield on interest-bearing assets such as bonds and
                   loans because of low interest rate environment, investment profit rose by 12.4% to krw 1,682.8 billion as a
                   result of stable growth in invested asset.
                   net profit in fy 2014 increased by 12.4% to krw 796.6 billion, with cash dividends standing at krw 4,500 per
                   share. based on the industry’s leading capital position, sfmi plans to concentrate on maintaining the stability
                   and efficiency of capital and enhancing shareholder value in the long term.

              overall direct premiums written rose 1.8% to krw 17.4 trillion.
              commercial insurance premium rose 1.0% to krw 1,543.6 billion. this was the result of strengthened
              underwriting for low margin contracts according to strategic change towards profit-driven growth. on the
              other hand, net premiums earned, which is the actual base of income, showed stable growth of 12.2% since
              the company improved its retention rate for profitable accounts.
              long-term insurance premium rose 1.1% to krw 12,018.2 billion. overall growth rate of long-term insurance
              has been decreased compared to the past year’s numbers. this is because new contracts for savings-
              type products including lump-sum premium sharply dropped following the company’s strategy pursuing
              substantial growth on protection-type products since 2013. however, the company’s portfolio of new premium
              and recurring premium, focused on highly profitable protection-type products significantly improved resulting
              in steady growth of the new business ev margin.
              auto insurance premium rose 4.6% to krw 3,796.3 billion despite the company’s underwriting policy centered
              on good contracts, and an increase of online contracts with low premiums. this was the result of premium hike
              for certain types of automobiles as well as increased sales of new vehicles.

              despite improved expense ratio, total combined ratio rose by 0.3%p to 103.4% as the loss ratio worsened
              compared to the previous year.
              loss ratio of commercial insurance recorded 62.9%, up by 3.5%p year on year as there occurred a number of

              overall loss ratio of long-term insurance recorded 88.4%, up 0.6%p from the previous year. risk loss ratio,
              which is an effective underwriting indicator, rose by 4.1%p to 77.9%. this was mainly due to additional
              reserves from the regulation changes in ibnr.
              loss ratio of auto insurance recorded 83.0%, down 3.5%p from the previous year. despite the fact that
              premium per policy has decreased due to growth in discounted online, the accident rate also declined mainly
              backed by strengthened underwriting in offline and rising inflow of low risk customers.

              expense ratio in fy 2014 recorded 17.9%, down 0.1%p year on year. this is mainly because distribution costs
              improved by 0.8%p since there was no additional amortization of acquisition cost which was incurred in
              fy2013. on the other hand, wage & severance benefits and administration costs increased by 0.2%p, 0.4%p
              respectively as a result of expanding investment on key personnel and infrastructure aiming to strengthen the

              investment income
              investment income rose 12.4% year on year to krw 1,682.8 billion. this rise is mainly attributable to
              an increase of interest income from bonds and loans, which accounts for 78% of the invested assets,
              by krw 96.3 billion and 35.7 billion respectively investment profit from equities also showed a sizable
              improvement of krw 76.5 billion, as there were less impairment losses and more dividend income
              incurred this year. investment yield fell by 0.1%p to 3.8% due to fall in yield on interest-bearing assets
              affected by the continued low interest rate environment.

                         awareness, ultimately to eliminate traffic related accidents. the institute conducts scientific and systematic
                         research on safely of roads, vehicles and drivers to investigate traffic accident prevention measures.
                         additionally, it also issues press releases, makes policy proposals and stages traffic safety campaigns. the
                         institute also offers special safety education and information programs to members of the society who are
                         exposed to greater safety risks, such as children, inexperienced and elderly drivers.

                         blind people around obstacles. a well-established guide dog support system reflects a society’s level of
                         awareness of persons with disabilities. as such, societies with high accommodation for guide dogs are widely
                         recognized as advanced welfare societies. sfmi has trained and donated guide dogs to the visually impaired
                         since 1993 and as of 2014 174 dogs (11 dogs in 2014 alone) were donated to the blind people, offering them
                         opportunities for new and improved lives. the past recipients of sfml’s guide dogs are now productive
                         members of the society, standing as college students, teachers, public officials and pianists.

                         support for gifted youths with disabilities: ‘poco a poco’ is an annual concert organized by sfmi and

                         disabilities various stage experiences and opportunities to communicate music to the world. poco-a-poco,
                         which means ‘step-by-step’ in italian, gives children hope to achieve their dreams towards becoming talented
                         musicians.

                         adolescents. opposed to documentaries, drama productions easily provoke emotions in viewers, making it
                         more effective when educating and reaching out to adolescents on such matters. the dramas have been aired
                         on persons with disability day since 2009, under the direction and production of sfmi media department.

independent assurance report
to the management of samsung fire & marine insurance
we have been engaged by samsung fire & marine insurance (the “company”) to perform an independent assurance engagement
in regard to the following aspects of samsung fire & marine insurance sustainability report 2015 (the “report”).




scope and subject matter    the information for the year ended december 31, 2014 (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the “sustainability information”) on
                            which we provide limited assurance consists of:


                            	the company’s conclusion on meeting the principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness in the aa1000 accountability
                               principles

                               prepared based on the reporting principles set out on gri g4 guideline with core option


                            we read the other information included in the report and considered whether it was consistent with the sustainability information.
                            we considered the implications for our report in the case that we became aware of any apparent misstatements or material
                            inconsistencies with the sustainability information. our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.




assurance work performed	we conducted our engagement in accordance with isae 3000(1) and aa1000as(2). the term ‘moderate assurance’ used in
                            aa1000as(2008) is designed to be consistent with ‘limited assurance’ as articulated in isae 3000. our assurance is a type ii
                            assurance engagement as defined in the aa1000as(2008).


                            (1) 	international standard on assurance engagements 3000 – ‘assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical
                               financial information’ issued by international auditing and assurance standards board
                            (2) aa1000 assurance standard(2008), issued by accountability


                            our work involved the following activities:


                            1. 	interviews with the personnel responsible for internal reporting and data collection to discuss their approach to stakeholder
                               inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness
                            2. 	visits to the company’s headquarter in seoul to understand the systems and processes in place for managing and reporting the
                               sustainability data
                            3. 	review of samples of internal documents relevant to output from the risk assessment process, sustainability-related policies and
                               standards, the sustainability materiality assessment matrix and other documents from stakeholder-engaged activities
                            4. evaluating the design and implementation of the key processes and controls for managing and reporting the sustainability data
                            5. limited testing, through inquiry and analytical review procedures, of the preparation and collation of the sustainability data
                            6. interviews with the management of the company




respective responsibilities of the management of the company and samil pricewaterhousecoopers	
			
				the management of the company is responsible for establishing reporting principles that meet the principles of inclusivity,
                            materiality and responsiveness in the aa1000aps, measuring performance based on the reporting principles, and reporting this
                            performance in the report.


                            our responsibility is to provide a conclusion based on our assurance procedures in accordance with isae 3000 and aa1000as.


                            this report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for the management of the company as a body, to assist the management
                            in reporting on the company’s sustainability performance and activities. we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other
                            than the management of the company as a body and the company for our work or this report save where terms are expressly
                            agreed and with our prior consent in writing.

inherent limitations	non-financial performance information is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information, given the characteristics of
                             the subject matter and the methods used for determining such information. qualitative interpretations of relevance, materiality and
                             the accuracy of data are subject to individual assumptions and judgments.
                             a limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement under isae 3000. consequently,
                             the nature, timing and extent of procedures for gathering sufficient, appropriate evidence are deliberately limited relative to a
                             reasonable assurance engagement.


                             in particular:
                             	we did not attend any stakeholder-engaged activities. therefore our conclusion is based on our discussions with the
                                 management and the staff of the company and our review of sampled documents provided to us by the company.
                             	the scope of our work was restricted to 2014 performance only, as set out in the scope and subject matter section above.
                                 information related to the year ended december 31, 2013 and earlier periods have not been subject to assurance by us.




conclusion                   based on the results of the assurance work performed, our conclusion is as follows.


                              on the aa1000aps principles


                                 - inclusivity      ·	the company has collected concerns and opinion through stakeholder communication channels that
                                                      include those of customers, partners, investors, communities and employees.
                             			                    ·	nothing has come to our attention to suggest that material stakeholder groups were excluded from these
                                                      channels.
                                 - materiality      ·	the company has identified most relevant and significant sustainability issues through process for
                                                      identifying material issues.
                             			                    ·	nothing has come to our attention to suggest that material issues were omitted in this process.
                                 - responsiveness ·	the company has included in the report its response to the material sustainability issues which are defined
                                                      through process for identifying material issues.
                             			                    ·	nothing has come to our attention to suggest that there were material deficiencies in the issue
                                                      management system.


                             	nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability data for the year ended december 31,
                             	2014 is not fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with the company’s internal reporting principles set out on gri
                                 (global reporting initiative) g4 guideline with core option.

                             	it is recommended to manage key performance indicators with wider scope which are aligned with performance evaluation of
                                 each part of the company in order to effectively implement sustainability strategy and address sustainability issues corporate-
