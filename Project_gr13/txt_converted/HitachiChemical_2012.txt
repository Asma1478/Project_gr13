         promotion of sustainable engineering
the hitachi chemical group recognizes that its ability to conceptualize business at the highest level and to maintain unparal-
leled technological and management expertise and skills are essential to realizing sustainable business. collectively, these
qualities are referred to as sustainable engineering. we are equally convinced that innovation is the primary driving force behind
promoting sustainable engineering. in fiscal 2011, the first year of the hitachi chemical group csr medium-term roadmap:
stage 2, we have clarified the responsibilities of each executive officer and identified our ideal scenario for each business divi-
sion through to 2015. drawing on this broad picture of the group’s future, we have established quantitative targets and key
performance indicators (kpis) for each fiscal year while initiating an appropriate follow-up program to monitor and assess ongo-
ing progress. turning to the group’s traditional focus on carbon management, the promotion of resource recycling and the
reduction of resource loss, we have also positioned business innovation at the heart of each initiative to provide the underlying
impetus for our efforts to promote sustainable engineering. details of the group’s performance in fiscal 2011 and objectives for
fiscal 2012 are outlined in the following table. in the initial year of the hitachi chemical group csr medium-term roadmap:

  1 expand sales of the cel-w- series of white epoxy molding compounds for use in led packages

     the cel-w series of white epoxy molding compounds manufac-
     tured at the company’s shimodate works are used as reflective ma-
     terial in leds. the use of leds is increasing at a rapid pace because
     they have a service life tens of times longer than incandescent lamps,
     and energy consumption is a fraction that of incandescent lamps.
     increasing luminance even further remains an outstanding technol-
     ogy issue, but the cel-w series has been praised for its outstanding
     reflective characteristics as well as its high heat and light resistance
     (characteristics that deteriorate little even under bright light).

     topic in sustainable engineering. hitachi chemical is working dili-
     gently to conserve energy and reduce co2 emissions in carbon bak-
     ing processes for anode materials in the lithium ion batteries used in
     hybrid and electric vehicles, an area in which the company has en-
     joyed significant growth in recent years and in which it expects con-
     tinued expansion in the future. in addition to installing the latest
     high-efficiency equipment, the company will look to optimize the
     entire manufacturing process, including maintenance of existing fur-
     naces, in an effort to increase efficiency and reduce co2 emissions.

 3 develop disk brake pads that comply with north american regulation for copper alloys

   disk pads are components used in the brakes of cars and motorcy-
   cles that stop the vehicles by being inserted on both sides of the
   discs that rotate with the vehicles. although they are extremely
   light, disk pads wear down from friction when they are used. gener-
   ally, copper is used in disk pads to enhance wear resistance, but
   there are concerns that the dissipated copper results in water pollu-
   tion, and restrictions on copper used in disc pads will come into ef-
   fect in the united states in 2021. as part of our sustainable engi-
   neering efforts, we plan to bring copper-free disc pads to the market
   in advance of the regulations coming into effect. our goal is to halve
   copper usage by 2015.

 4 expand sales of enamel wire insulating varnishes for use in hev drive motors

   varnish that acts as an enamel wire insulation (liquid insulating ma-
   terial) is used on the coils that are an essential component of mo-
   tors. enamel wire insulating varnishes are used extensively in indus-
   trial motors and transformers. hybrid electric vehicle drive motors
   require significant energy-saving properties as well as substantial
   cost effects. these products have been praised by customers with
   regard to both properties.

outlook and forecasts for the fiscal year ending
march 31, 2013
looking ahead, the u.s. economy offers limited comfort with its recovery
lacking in overall strength. there are also concerns that the persistent
debt crisis in europe will continue to have a negative impact on the
economies of emerging countries. on the domestic front, the japanese
economy is expected to remain precarious, marked by the sluggish
increase in exports, rising crude oil prices, electric power shortages, and
resultant decline in corporate-sector earnings.
       against this backdrop and a future economic environment that
remains shrouded in uncertainty, the hitachi chemical group will imple-
ment measures that preempt any future change, expand its business
scale in global markets and improve earnings capabilities with the aim of
building a strong operating platform that is capable of taking the next
leap forward.

the method of calculating the fair value of financial instruments is as                                            debentures
follows:                                                                                                           the fair value of debentures issued by the company is the value provided by

as these items are settled in the short term, the fair value of these items
approximates the book value, therefore, the book value is used.                                                    long-term loans payable

 (act no.114 of 2011) and the “act on special measures for securing financial resources necessary to implement measures for reconstruction following the great
 east japan earthquake” (act no.117 of 2011) were promulgated on december 2, 2011 and the staged reduction of the national corporate tax rate and a special
 reconstruction corporate tax will apply to corporate taxes effective fiscal years beginning on or after april 1, 2012.

 to be utilized from fiscal years beginning april 1, 2015. the effect of the announced reduction of the effective corporate tax rate was to decrease deferred tax assets,
 net by ¥1,133 million ($13,817 thousand) and increase deferred income taxes by ¥1,193 million ($14,549 thousand) .
