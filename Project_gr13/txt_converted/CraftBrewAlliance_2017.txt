2016 was a great year for cba in terms of advancing our sustainability focus and supporting our local communities. from our kona brewery’s
award-winning makana beer series that has raised over $100,000 toward preserving hawaii’s natural resources, to widmer brothers’ long-term
commitment to protecting oregon’s watersheds, to redhook’s achievement as the first salmon-safe brewery in puget sound, we are proud of our

      “whether it’s sourcing glass bottles locally or right-weighting to decrease raw material, water and energy use, cba is
            progressive and committed to acting responsibly on behalf of the environment, consumers and the industry.”

brands’ deep commitment to serve as stewards of sustainability. last year, our brands donated over $230,000 in beer and sponsorships to support
our local communities. in the following pages, we share some of our favorite highlights from kona brewing, widmer brothers and redhook, includ-
ing key achievements within our three focus areas: carbon intensity, waste prevention, and local giving. we hope you enjoy reading about our efforts
and look forward to seeing you at one of our brewpubs in the future. if you’d like to learn more about our sustainability efforts, reach out to sustain-

                                                in 2016, we completed our first life cycle analysis on a bottle of kona beer to understand our
                                                biggest opportunities to reduce our carbon impact.

                                                one bottle of longboard generated 392 grams of co2 emissions. that’s well within the
