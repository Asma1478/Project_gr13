we recognize material aspects
the company recognizes its material aspects in the field of corporate responsibility, in each one of the above focus areas. aspects
include those which are related to the effect we might have, as well as possible concerns of our stakeholders. the identification process
is initiated by identifiying all potential aspects, according to current practices, future trends and conditions in the retail sector. in the next
step, the identified aspects are prioritized according to the significance of the impact the company either has or could have, as well as
the significance to our stakeholders. the following diagram illustrates schematically the results of the materiality analysis of marinopoulos
for 2013. it should be noted that due to the number of aspects that were addressed, all aspects that were not deemed material are not
represented schematically.

partners to earn a place in the market, without the need of
investments or entry rights (indicatively, the investment required to
operate a store in the scale of “carrefour express”, with an area of
250 to 500 m2, ranges from € 300,000 to 500,000), as each store
is handed over operational with its equipment, while the partner is
required only to cover product orders sold, fixed costs, as well as
maintain job positions.

as a result, in 2013, 16 new franchise stores were opened, reaching
overall 293 stores, with a consequent over 1,000 indirect job positions
having been established within the marinopoulos franchisee network.
indicative of the existing long-lasting collaboration is the fact that the
average duration of collaboration with franchisees is 7 years.

we lead retail trends


     good practice


establishing trends
we seek not only to create directly or indirectly job positions and offer know-how throughout our value chain, but moreover
introduce future trends in the retail market. to achieve this, we invest in a series of innovative niche markets:




cash & carry
in 2013, marinopoulos opened its first cash & carry named “terra market”
in pilea thessaloniki, initiating its presence within the wholesale market. by
the end of 2013, 4 more cash & carry were launched in trikala, athens,
chania and livadia.

wholesale stores expand our company's sales to retailers, freelancers, as
well as companies which operate in the food service, hotel and catering
sectors. cash & carry stores promote the “terraclub” card, which provides
significant benefits to professionals.




caremarket
marinopoulos, investing in electronic commerce, established the supermarket
of the future in greece, a new online service, which is based on the motto
“save time, save money” and makes shopping a faster and more pleasant
experience, as shopping can now be conducted at any time from
consumers’ homes or offices.

through this store, consumers have access from their computer to over
14,000 products, while simultaneously benefit from daily offers and low
prices. within 2013, the service was used by over 6,000 consumers, placing
over 15,400 orders, with an average value of over € 130. the service has
over 18,000 registered users, which demonstrates that this different
purchasing proposal is already a part of everyday purchasing routine for
many greeks.


      we processed over 15,400 orders                                                         process over 30,000
   through caremarket.gr within 2013.                                                      orders through caremarket.gr.



shop-in-a-shop
in 2013, marinopoulos and kotsovolos collaborated to create three shop-in-a-shop outlets of kotsovolos, within the marinopoulos stores
in gerakas, alimos and maroussi. this constitutes the first partnership of this kind in the greek market, between two of the leading retail
companies in the country, which addresses consumers seeking a different shopping experience, as it introduces a large variety of electrical
and electronic devices from major manufacturers and integrated logistics services within the aforementioned stores.

we care for the environment
in which we live
at marinopoulos, we are fully aware that our company, as every human and corporate
activity, requires natural resources and therefore consider the need to conduct our
activities in a way which limits, as far as possible, our environmental footprint as imperative.
for this reason, we adopt a proactive approach to mitigate our environmental challenges,
incorporate the principle of sustainable and responsible development in our decision
making processes, take initiatives to promote our environmental responsibility and
implement environmentally friendlier practices and technologies.

2. biodiversity

within the last 50 years, roughly 60% of ecosystems has been
disturbed by human activities. at global level, 70% of flora species
are either threatened, or endangered of vanishing, while the
biodiversity destruction rate is continuously increasing. at
marinopoulos we recognize that biodiversity constitutes an
essential component of our ecosystem’s balance, and therefore
focus our efforts to preserve it.

     good practice

environmentally friendlier stores
adopting modern practices in environmental planning and following
the renovations of carrefour alimos and macedonia hypermarkets
in 2012, we renovated and conducted significant interventions in our
carrefour hypermarket in maroussi at avenue shopping center
and in ioannina and argos stores, which led to an annual energy
consumption reduction of 28%-33%. interventions applied addressed
mainly cooling and heating systems, lighting and generally
electromagnetic and cooling installations.

due to these interventions, carbon dioxide savings correspond to a
total of 173,000 trees or 3,460 acres of forest, which would be
required to absorb the corresponding carbon dioxide savings from
these three stores.




      practices in other countries

carrefour cyprus, in order to achieve energy savings, has installed closed-type refrigerators and freezers, which allow better cooling
distribution, and has also replaced all light bulbs with economy lamps.

2. health and safety
we apply the precautionary principle
the majority of our private label products purchases is conducted by pre-approved suppliers, while in cases of low-scale purchases, we
have included in the selection process and purchasing contracts, specific requirements on subjects such as the environment, hygiene and
safety, practicing the precautionary principle. examples are:

food products - detergents - cosmetics
the precautionary principle is a core principle of our corporate policy, as it ensures safety and
quality of detergents and cosmetics, available in the greek market. even before the
implementation of this specific principle, our policies, regarding product ingredients, prohibited
the use of certain substances, whose potentially negative impact on consumers has not been
clearly determined by the scientific community.



                                                  children's products
                                                  regarding children’s safety, the established regulatory requirements are exceeded, as we
                                                  apply stricter standards for controlling specific chemical substances, which can potentially
                                                  be toxic, cancer-causing or allergenic. moreover, we strictly follow the eu legislation,
                                                  concerning small moving parts of products, in order to eliminate the risk of ingestion.
                                                  furthermore, independent laboratories and organizations confirm that necessary safety
                                                  control levels have been achieved.

aids) for production of above-mentioned conventional products. thus, the possible
concentration of genetically modified materials within these products does not exceed 0.9%,
                                                                                                       products.

example for imitation by institutions and municipalities all over the
country, which gives us great satisfaction.
