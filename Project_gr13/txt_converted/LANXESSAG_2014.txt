our process control concepts in a number of facilities. these newly
implemented concepts – including online analytics – enable us to run
plants even closer to the optimum operating point, which, in addition
to reducing costs, in some cases even increases their capacity. against
the backdrop of our strategic growth initiative, we are also stepping
up our efforts to refine the technological aspects of our processes
for growth projects. a key success factor is our process technology
laboratory where we can optimize existing processes as well as develop
new processes and investigate their transferability to industrial scale.

      report of the
      supervisory board



                                   dear stockholders,

                                   2013 was a very difficult year for lanxess. while the company had
                                   posted very good growth in the prior years, demand in the rubber busi-
                                   ness began to slacken in 2012, a development which continued in the
                                   reporting year. in addition, the effects of a supply overhang caused by
                                   higher production capacities became evident in 2013. changes in the
                                   competitive environment led to the recognition of impairment charges
                                   of €257 million in the fourth quarter. as a result of the difficult busi-
                                   ness situation overall, lanxess saw a substantial decline in earnings
                                   compared to previous years and posted ebitda pre exceptionals of
                                   just €735 million in fiscal 2013. against the backdrop of the difficult
                                   business environment, lanxess resolved in 2013 to take a range of
                                   efficiency measures and is continuing to implement these in 2014.

                                   at the beginning of the current fiscal year, the supervisory board
                                   decided on a change of leadership of the board of management
                                   and approved the mutually agreed termination of the appointment
                                   of dr. axel c. heitmann as member and chairman of the board of
                                   management. the supervisory board appointed matthias zachert as
                                   the new chairman of the board of management. until he joined merck
                                   kgaa in 2011, mr. zachert was chief financial officer of lanxess.
                                   he will take up his new position on april 1, 2014.

                                   during 2013, the supervisory board duly and fully performed the tasks
                                   and duties incumbent upon it under the law, the articles of association
                                   and the rules of procedure for the supervisory board. it advised the
                                   board of management regularly on the management of the company
                                   and monitored its work. in particular, the supervisory board concerned

      transfer substantially all risks and rewards incidental to the ownership
      of the leased assets to the lessee. in the lanxess group, operating
      leases are mainly used for operational reasons and not as a means
      of financing.

      the main liquidity reserve is a €1.25 billion syndicated credit facility,
      which was not significantly drawn upon as of year end. its original
      term was extended by one year in february 2014 to run until febru-
      ary 2019, and it can be renewed one more time for a further period
      of one year. a further material credit line of €200 million with the

       addition to credit facilities, the group has short-term liquidity reserves
       of €533 million (2012: €797 million) in the form of cash and cash
