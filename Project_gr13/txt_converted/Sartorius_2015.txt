     strategic planning for sartorius 2020

     sartorius aims to grow sustainably and profitably in
     the future as well. the group thus plans to generate
     sales revenue of around €2 billion by 2020. approxi-
     mately two-thirds of this growth is to be achieved
     organically; around one third, through acquisitions.
     moreover, sartorius plans to increase its underlying
     ebitda margin to around 23%. sartorius has executed
     on its 2020 strategic plan developed in 2011 by im-
     plementing a number of initiatives related to regional
     growth, product portfolio and infrastructure.

     in view of our organic growth and continued im-
     provement of profitability, we are on track to achieve
     these goals. however, the sales revenue that can be
     contributed by acquisitions substantially depends on
     the availability of appropriate takeover targets.

     regionally, north america is a focus of sartorius' growth
     strategy. both for the manufacture of biopharmaceuti-
     cals and laboratory products, north america is the
     world’s largest market. sartorius still has below-average
     market share in this region, also because the usa is the
     home market for the vast majority of our competitors.
     to gain market share, we have strengthened our capa-
     cities primarily in sales, distribution and services and
     enhanced our sales processes.

     our second regional focus is on asia, especially on
     china and india. these markets have tremendous po-
     tential and are growing at higher-than-average rates.
     to participate in this momentum in the best possible
     way, sartorius considerably invested in its sales infra-
     structure in this region as well.

     in addition, acquisitions primarily focused on comple-
     mentary technologies and products are to contribute
     to our future growth. over the past years, we success-
     fully expanded our wide array of products and services
     through several small and medium-sized acquisitions.

     to make business processes more efficient, sartorius
     is globally introducing a new erp system, which is
     already in use at group headquarters in goettingen,
     germany. moreover, we are continuously expanding
     capacity at our manufacturing sites. in goettingen, we
     are combining our plant sites still located in separate
     areas into one location as part of a multi-year project.
     at the same time, we are extending our local produc-
     tion capacities.

the national economies in europe showed quite uneven
development again in the reporting year. the euro
zone continued to be affected by the consequences of
the financial crisis: the overall high sovereign debt of
the member nations and their comparably high unem-
ployment rate had a negative impact yet again. after
contracting for several years, the euro-zone economy,
however, did record a slight increase of 0.8% in the

     management report, however, report only on continu-
     ing operations in accordance with the presentation in
     the consolidated financial statements and notes.

     sartorius grew considerably yet again in 2014. sales
     revenue rose by 11.3% in constant currencies, thus
     slightly exceeding the forecast range of 8% to 10%
     announced at the beginning of the year. the profit
     margin based on underlying ebitda rose to 20.2%,
     slightly above our forecast of approximately 20%.

     to facilitate future growth, sartorius expanded capaci-
     ties in several production facilities and invested in its
     it systems in the reporting year. the capex ratio rela-
     tive to sales revenue amounted to 8.6%, well in line
     with the 8% to 10% range forecasted at the beginning
     of the year.

     the group's financial position remained broadly un-
     changed and stable. the equity ratio was 39.1% after
     38.1% in 2013, and thus remained at a comfortable
     level. the ratio of net debt to underlying ebitda for
     the last twelve months was 1.7, following on from 2.0
     in 2013, and thus developed slightly better than fore-
     casted at the start of the year.

     as the application of irfs 5 had only a minor effect on
     the particular division results, a comparison with the
     respective forecasts is provided in the chapters on the
     divisions.

     reported a surge in sales of 37.1%, which was partly
     induced by acquisitions. in addition, the business ex-

     revenue for lab products & services likewise increased
     sharply, by 13.3%. (all rates of change in constant

     for the asia | pacific region, which accounts for around
     23% of consolidated sales, we saw a double-digit gain
     again, 10.9%, in the year under review. the key growth
     driver was the bioprocess solutions division, which
     boosted its sales revenue by 17.4%. performance was
     driven by both large equipment orders and strong
     demand for our single-use products. given the weak
     market environment, especially at the beginning of the
     year, the lab products & services division reported
     sales growth of 1.4%. (all rates of change in constant

        or the employer, retirements and other reasons for employees
        leaving the company



     the attrition rate, which expresses the number of
     people leaving the company as a percentage of the
     average head count, fell to 8.6% for the group in the
     reporting year (previous year: 9.3%). the attrition rate
     generally varies from region to region, and this is also
     true at sartorius. at our german sites, this rate is
     typically low. in 2014, it stood at 4.4% after 3.9% in
     the previous year. in countries with a high average
     attrition rate, such as china and india, sartorius suc-
     cessfully lowered this rate through various employee
     retention and motivation activities. as a result, the
     attrition rate in asia dropped considerably, from
     11.9% to 8.4% in the fiscal year under review.

     the absence rate, or the proportion of planned work-
     ing time that is not worked due to general absences,
     decreased in the reporting year across the group. even
     the average time missed per employee due to illness
     dropped from 7.1 days in 2013 to 6.6 in fiscal 2014.

2 percentage points, as expected. accordingly, sales
revenue in the reporting period rose 1.4% in constant
currencies from €273.8 million to €275.5 million and
was thus at the lower end of our growth forecast of
1% to 4%.

in europe, the region contributing the highest share of
sales revenue of more than 50%, sales revenue did not
quite reach the high prior-year level (-1.2%). here, the
discontinuation of non-strategic products still had a
noticeable impact on sales in the year under review. in
asia | pacific, which accounts for around 27% of
business for the lab products & services division, sales
revenue grew 1.4%. this figure was affected by the
weak market environment at the beginning of the year,
particularly in china. in north america that generated
approximately 16% of the division’s revenues, sales
revenue climbed significantly by 13.3%. the strong
demand for our laboratory instruments as well as our
consumable products and services contributed to this
growth. (all rates of change in constant currencies)

     production and supply chain management

     the lab products & services division operates plants in
     germany, china, finland, the u.k. and the u.s. the
     plants also serve as centers of competence and conse-
     quently tend to focus on one product group or a small
     set of product groups. laboratory balances are manu-
     factured in goettingen and beijing, for example, while
     pipettes are made at our helsinki and souzhou sites.
     kits for microbiological tests are produced in
     stonehouse, and most membrane-based products are
     manufactured in goettingen.


     capacity expanded

     sartorius invested in creating additional production
     capacity at a number of sites in the reporting year.
     new machinery and enhanced processes for pipette tip
     manufacturing have been in place since the summer of
     2014 at its kajaani plant in finland.

     in addition, construction of a new laboratory instru-
     ment production facility began in october at the
     goettingen site, where two plants from separate sites
     in goettingen are being combined in this new building
     as part of the sartorius campus project. a calibration
     center, prototype manufacturing unit and a training
     workshop will also be integrated.

     sartorius has invested in more efficient logistics too.
     like the bioprocess solutions division, lab products &
     services uses the logistics center that sartorius along
     with a joint venture partner built in goettingen for
     shipping products and supplying manufacturing oper-
     ations. in the future, the division will deliver products
     to customers in asia centrally through its distribution
     hub in suzhou, china.

the third term of dr. kreuzburg as a member of the
executive board and its chairman and ceo will expire
on november 10, 2015. by resolution of the supervisory
board on december 16, 2014, dr. kreuzburg was reap-
pointed as a member of the executive board and as its
chairman and ceo for the term of november 11, 2015,
to november 10, 2020. due to dr. kreuzburg’s excel-
lent performance in developing the company since
the start of his tenure on the executive board on
november 11, 2002, the company wished to continue
this successful cooperation with him, despite alternative
offers that were made to him. the new remuneration
agreement therefore provides that 25,000 ordinary
shares and 25,000 preference shares of the company
shall be transferred as a supplementary compensation
component to dr. kreuzburg. this share-based payment
is subject to the rules of ifrs 2 and is deemed to have
been granted upon the resolution approved by the
supervisory board on december 16, 2014. the follow-
ing basic structure has been agreed upon: the transfer
of the shares granted shall be effected at the time to
be determined by dr. kreuzburg, but no earlier than on

        recognized amount corresponds to actual target achievement of the plan in which a fiscal year ended; i.e., for 2014, consolidated net profits

        fair value at the grant date. for shares granted to dr. kreuzburg in fiscal 2014, this is derived from the number of shares granted (25,000
        ordinary shares and 25,000 preference shares) and their respective price on the stock exchange on the grant date (€100 and €98, resp.).
        due to the share-based payment arrangement, expected dividends are not to be included in the measurement of these shares.



     as part of the remuneration component based on the
     consolidated net profit of three consecutive fiscal
     years, each executive board member receives a partial
     compensation payment of 50% of his respective target
     achievement for the first fiscal year under review.
     once the total target achievement has been deter-
     mined after the third fiscal year, final payment is then
     effected by deducting the particular partial payment
     already made. the amounts of the partial payments
     made in total at the end of the reporting year are
     shown as follows:

     the french muscular dystrophy association (afm-
     téléthon), a charity with which we have been working
     for several years, received a christmas donation of
     €80,000 from sartorius. this will be used to help fund
     research in rare nervous system and muscle disorders
     and the development of gene and stem cell therapies.
     the company also provided laboratory equipment
     worth €50,000 to support the goettingen experi-

     supporting events for the scientific community

     sartorius regularly takes part in symposiums, conven-
     tions, annual conferences and events for the scientific
     community, primarily involving the bioprocess industry,
     in addition to maintaining long-term alliances with
     scientific institutions. it supported the international
     and regional annual conferences of the u.s.-based
     parenteral drug association (pda) and the interna-
     tional society for pharmaceutical engineering (ispe) in
     2014, for example. ispe is an independent not-for-
     profit association dedicated to employee education
     and information sharing across the pharmaceutical
     industry worldwide. sartorius was also involved in
     symposiums presented by the chinese academy of
     inspection and quarantine (caiq), whose areas of
     expertise include quality assurance in the lab.

      in fiscal 2014, these impairment tests did not result in
      the recognition of impairment losses. even realistic
      changes in the basic assumptions upon which mea-
      surement of the value in use is based would not result
      in the carrying amount of the cash-generating units'
      exceeding their value in use. upon classification of the
      intec division as a discontinued operation, the criteri-
      on for testing its (reclassified) goodwill for impairment
      must be applied according to fair value less costs to
      sell. as of the reporting date, there was no need to
      recognize any impairment loss based on the expected
      selling price.
