   our deeply rooted commitment to citizenship dates

   2016 corporate citizenship
   performance
    five-year goals
    ti successfully reduced energy, water use and greenhouse gas emissions
    per chip produced in 2016 compared to our 2010 baseline. and, in 2015 the
    company set two multiyear goals to further reduce greenhouse gas (ghg)
    emissions by 2020.
    the first goal is to reduce energy intensity* at u.s. manufacturing sites by 50
    percent (from a 2010 baseline) to meet the u.s. department of energy’s better
    buildings, better plants program goal. by the end of 2016, we had already
    reduced energy intensity by 39 percent. the second goal is to reduce scope
    1 and scope 2 ghg emissions by 15 percent (from a 2015 baseline), which we
    are working to achieve.
