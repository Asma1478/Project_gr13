         back at our more than 87 years of history shows that three major phases of transition have marked our
         transformation from automotive brake lining producer to comprehensive brake manufacturer.

    for achievement in the “development and mass production of high-
    performance brakes for road cars” akebono was awarded the fy2015
    japan society of mechanical engineers (jsme) medal for new
    technology. the brake systems are used in the ultra-high performance
    road car “p1tm” made by the u.k. automaker mclaren.
        established in 1958 with the aims of encouraging research activities
    and development of mechanical engineering in japan, the jsme medal
    has been presented annually to outstanding papers, technologies and
    products. in awarding the medal, the judges recognized akebono’s high
    achievement in “stability when braking at ultra-high speed and high
    temperature levels,” “significant weight reduction,” and “comfortable
    braking in city driving.”
        this is the second time in 34 years that akebono has received the            brake system for mclaren p1tm
    award, the previous time being in 1982.
