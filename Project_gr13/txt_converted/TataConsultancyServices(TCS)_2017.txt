stakeholder engagement and
materiality definition
our stakeholders

tcs engages with a broad spectrum of stakeholders – internal and external – to understand their concerns and
priorities, and use these to guide policy formulation and decision-making. business considerations largely
govern decisions on which stakeholders to engage with, and in what manner and periodicity.

key stakeholders are identified through a prioritization exercise undertaken in consultation with our company's
management. these include everyone from customers, employees, shareholders, and investors to engineering
colleges, staffing agencies, and other vendors. a stakeholder interaction exercise with both internal and external
stakeholders is then undertaken as part of the development of this report. tcs is a member of a number of
industry bodies such as nasscom and cii, and works closely with these in shaping policy.

exhibit 3 describes tcs' stakeholder interaction framework including the topics of most significance to each
group. some other stakeholders that we closely engage with – such as industry analysts, equity analysts, and the
media – have not been mentioned here because they are proxies for other named stakeholders – customers,
shareholders, and the larger society, respectively.

                                         material topics
                                         stakeholder interactions of the various interfacing groups within tcs result in the identification of a broad funnel
                                         of issues important to each of the constituencies. customer satisfaction surveys, employee surveys, first hand
                                         feedback from investors and discussions with internal and external stakeholders serve as formal inputs in
                                         prioritizing the significance of those identified issues to each of the stakeholder groups. internal stakeholders
                                         included senior management members and employees, whereas external stakeholders included shareholders,
                                         suppliers, contractors, ngos, and academic institutions. during the sustainability council’s deliberations, senior
                                         executives assess the impact of each of the most significant issues to arrive at a prioritized list of material topics
                                         with significant economic, environmental, and social impacts on tcs’ business, reputation and operations,
                                         forming the basis for this report. these topics are listed in exhibit 4.

                                           being a part of the 149-year-old tata group, which epitomizes sustainability, tcs has inherited a strong legacy of
                                           fair and transparent ethical governance, as embodied in the tata code of conduct (tcoc). our corporate
                                           governance strategy is aligned with the ten principles articulated in the un global compact, to which tcs is a
                                           signatory.

                                           at the top of the governance structure is the board of directors, representing the shareholders and various
                                           committees on the board, and overseeing the executive management. tcs has a unitary board structure
                                           consisting of 11 members, of whom eight are non-executive directors (including the chairman), and six are
                                           independent directors. the composition of the company's board and detailed profiles of the board members are

                         company location guide employees on matters related to ethics.
                         a whistle blower policy has also been incorporated through which
                         instances of serious violation of the code of conduct can be reported
                         directly to the board without fear of reprisal.

                         customers and suppliers are made aware of the tcoc through speciﬁc
                         clauses in proposals, contracts, contract discussions, supplier code of
                         conduct documents, and through the tcs website.

                         senior managers with access to privileged information have to comply
                         with the code for the prevention of insider trading. tcs also has a global
                         policy on prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace. this policy
                         was updated in february 2014 to align with current legal mandates, in
                         particular the 'sexual harassment of women at workplace (prevention,
                         prohibition and redressal) act, 2013' enacted in india, where tcs has the
                         majority of its workforce.

                         our policies and training modules are periodically reviewed and revised to
                         comply with legislations with respect to bribery, corruption, and with
                         improved norms on business ethics. tcs' enterprise risk management
                         program (erm) involves risk identiﬁcation, assessment, and mitigation
                         planning for strategic, operational, and compliance related risks across
                         business units, functions and geographies.

                         at the board level, the ethics and compliance committee oversees tcs'
                         compliance to the tata code of conduct, which is applicable to directors
                         as well as other employees. monthly reports are sent to the board-level
                         committee on matters relating to the tcoc.



 board composition and   the nomination and remuneration committee, consisting of two
 selection of board      independent directors and three non-independent directors, including
 members                 the chairman, makes recommendations regarding the composition of the
                         board, identiﬁes suitable individuals who can be inducted as independent
                         directors, and takes steps to refresh the composition of the board from
                         time to time.

                         the supervisory capability of the current board has been signiﬁcantly
                         boosted by the inclusion of highly capable individuals with global
                         management perspectives, broad corporate experience, speciﬁc
                         expertise in corporate governance, and compliance as independent, non-
                         executive directors.

               aspect                                          approach


     employee access to the    tcs employees are empowered with a culture that encourages open
     board                     communications and oﬀers various channels for communicating
                               concerns and grievances. larger concerns are presented to the board by
                               the executive directors. in addition, individual senior-level employees
                               are also invited to present to the board on speciﬁc topics under
                               discussion from time to time.

                               lastly, the company has a whistle blower policy, with the necessary
                               mechanism for employees to directly report concerns about unethical
                               behavior to the chairperson of the audit committee without fear of
                               reprisal or victimization.

     sustainability and risk   tcs has an enterprise compliance management framework and process
     management                that has been deployed across the company. a digital platform provides
                               an enterprise-wide view of compliance across global locations. major
                               risks are regularly identiﬁed and systematically addressed through
                               mitigating actions.

                               we ensure compliance to all applicable laws globally, including those
                               relating to employment and immigration; taxation; forex and export
                               controls; health, safety, and environment; company laws; establishment;
                               sez regulations; data privacy; anti-bribery and anti-corruption
                               regulations; and it security. a committee at the corporate level oversees
                               and monitors the deployment of the compliance function.


     succession planning       business sustainability requires consistency in management vision and
                               minimization of impact when there is a leadership change. therefore,
                               succession planning is an important element in ensuring smooth
                               transitions. at tcs, this occurs at every level – corporate, business unit,
                               account, and even project.

                               at the highest level, succession planning of senior management is
                               directly reviewed by the executive committee of the board. business or
                               unit heads are invited to board meetings from time to time to update the
                               board. this provides an opportunity for the board to interact with senior
                               executives periodically and assess values, competencies, and
                               capabilities that can help them identify suitable internal successors.



     remuneration policy       the company follows a compensation mix of ﬁxed pay, beneﬁts and
                               performance-linked variable pay. individual performance pay is
                               determined by business-unit performance as well as individual
                               performance, measured through the annual appraisal process.

demand sustainability
the global market for outsourced it services is estimated at $1.2 tn.² this is a highly fragmented market in which
tcs – despite being one of the top 10 service providers - has a very small market share of under 2%
tcs continues to grow significantly faster than the broader market on account of deeper capabilities in new
technologies and a superior execution model and we don’t expect this trend to change

with technology getting increasingly embedded into core products and services and thereby becoming a basis
of competitive differentiation, the technology intensity of businesses is going up. at the same time, the
propensity to outsource is increasing on account of the shortening shelf-lives of new technologies, reducing the
enterprise’s ability to predict the longevity of any new technology in which it invests in building in-house
capability. tcs expects these trends to serve as a structural tailwind to longer-term growth.


strategy for business sustainability
tcs' customer-centric strategy is built on continually investing in building newer capabilities to expand our
participation in our customers' spend and to stay relevant to them at every point in their business cycle, while
being technology-agnostic and while broadening our addressable market. details of this strategy are provided
on pages 62-63 of the fy 2016-17 annual report.

details of the manner in which tcs has adapted to, and gained leadership in, the ongoing shift to digital
technologies are provided on pages 63-64 of the annual report.

the strategic risks faced by tcs, and the company's approach to mitigating them are summarized on pages 70
and 71 of the fy 2016-17 annual report.


structured for agility
a common concern is whether tcs can retain the same agility and responsiveness that have come to define the
organization as it gains greater scale. our customer-centric, modular organizational structure addresses both
these concerns. tcs is organized into over two dozen business units, each aligned to an industry vertical. each
market-facing business unit is responsible end-to-end to an exclusive set of customers in its designated domain,
owns its resources, and pursues growth in that domain, armed with all the agility and focus of a smaller company.


investing in innovation
our research and innovation (r&i) efforts strengthen the company's sustainability in the following ways:

n scan emerging technologies, identify trends and build capabilities in relevant areas
n collaborate with the industry solution units to create a pipeline of new offerings
n create intellectual property, improve the company's revenue mix and boost profits
n create thought leadership in new technologies

details of our research & innovation focus areas in fy 2016-17, various developments and milestones achieved
are detailed on page 41 of the fy 2016-17 annual report. additionally, there is an interview with our cto giving
further insights on our r&i initiatives on page 20 of the annual report.³

                                      continually scan the environment for potential threats using our robust risk management framework.

                                      our pricing and our operating margins have been stable, evidencing the resilience of our business model and the

                                      tcs has implemented a comprehensive information security management system (isms) based on the globally
                                      recognized iso 27001:2013 isms standard. this framework covers cyber security, privacy, physical /

                                      our workforce
                                      our business is extremely people-centric and therefore the ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain talent
                                      is critical to the sustainability of our business. at a time of profound and rapid technology change,

talent diversity
tcs is an equal opportunity employer and subscribes to the tata code of conduct in embracing diversity in race,
nationality, religion, ancestry, marital status, gender, age, ethnic origin, physical ability, and sexual orientation.
compensation levels are merit-based and are determined by qualification, experience levels, special skills if any,
and performance. gender and any of the other diversity parameters do not play a part in determining
compensation levels. tcs has a well-defined diversity and inclusion policy. tcs’ talent acquisition strategy has
resulted in greater diversity of gender, geographic locations, and academic discipline. we are today one of the
world’s largest employer of women.

progressive policies such as extended parental leave; special focus on the security of women employees; a
mentoring program for junior women employees (nwin); discussion circles to help women through major life
stages; a reorientation program to re-connect employees after long leave; projecting profiles of inspirational
women leaders (be-inspired); special leadership development programs to address the needs and aspirations of
women; a learning module to equip mid-level managers to work with diverse teams; a virtual support group
(workplace parents group) on child psychology; and parenting workshops for working parents have all gone
towards making the workplace more gender equal.

tcs was named as one of the uk’s leading employers for women in the times top 50 employers for women, in
recognition of our commitment to gender equality and for providing women avenues to pursue their
professional aspirations. we celebrated the second anniversary of our all-women bps and it center at riyadh,

economic development model promotes long-term career opportunities for saudi women. our center of
excellence for accessibility works on it solutions for differently-abled individuals, aiding their integration into the
workforce. in addition to building diversity within our own workforce, tcs also works actively to encourage
greater diversity in the workforce in the communities we work in.

                                        competitive compensation
                                        tcs has to attract and retain talent in a highly competitive market. most of our workforce consists of software
                                        engineers who hold graduate and post-graduate degrees in engineering, and possess technical skills that are
                                        highly valued in the global labor market.

                                        we regularly benchmark our compensation plans and benefits with peers to ensure competitiveness. there is
                                        also a skill-based allowance for employees possessing niche skills, designed to motivate employees to acquire
                                        marketable skills, thereby benefiting themselves as well as the company.

                                        compensation structures are driven by prevailing practices in each country we operate in. but across the
                                        enterprise, remuneration is the same for men and women working full-time, in the same grade, in the same role,
                                        at the same location. in india, in addition to a fixed component of the salary, there is a variable component linked
                                        to the performance of the company, the business unit, and the individual. this alignment of our company's and
                                        employees’ interests has the effect of strengthening team spirit and improving collaboration among teams.

occupational health and safety
tcs follows both the tata group safety policy and its occupational health and safety (ohs) policy to ensure the
safety and well-being of its employees. our ohs management system has been implemented at nearly 113
locations worldwide. at tcs locations which have iso 18001:2007 occupational health and safety management
standard certification, or where there is a local legal requirement, there are formal joint management-worker
health and safety committees that monitor, advise and drive occupational health and safety initiatives. each
committee has cross-functional representation, is chaired by senior management and meets on a quarterly basis.
about 96% of our workforce is represented by such committees.

additionally, the board-level health, safety, and sustainability committee and the corporate sustainability
council review our health and safety performance on a regular basis. (see exhibit 9).

exhibit 9: occupational health and safety objectives and targets

to make tcsers safety-conscious in all walks of life, we have extended the concept of ohs beyond the workplace.
while we continue to focus on risks like fire safety, ergonomics, work environment management, office safety,
and road safety in company-provided transport. employee engagement on matters of health, safety and
environment takes the form of training and educational campaigns. in fy 2016-17, hse training accounted for
over 1,200,000 person-hours.

other programs launched under our safety first initiative are:

n general health: over 20,000 associates took advantage of the preventive healthcare check-up camps
   organized by a leading diagnostics firm in india. focused programs on cardiac well-being, cholesterol issues,
   liver and kidney diseases, and vitamin deficiencies were conducted.

n emotional safety: counselling sessions were held on unsafe practices, domestic issues, personal stress, and
   relationship issues. training and awareness sessions about self-harm, with a focus on helping leaders, hr
   teams, and safety champions identify early warning indicators, were also conducted. campaigns such as
   ‘how r u’ and ‘be calm and live your life’ have helped create awareness about counsellor-led services and

                                             locations. tcs has deployed the location-specific night exit policy, and arranged for free airport pick-up and
                                             drop facilities for women associates.

impact, we have an enterprise-wide volunteering program called purpose4life (p4l). it seeks to motivate
employees to contribute their time and skills towards social causes in the areas of education, health and
environment. employees are able to participate in the csr projects undertaken by tcs, as well as in

environmental sustainability
we believe that environmental stewardship is not just the right thing to do, but also something that enhances
longer term shareholder value. guided by our environmental policy⁴, we have built environmental sustainability
into our daily operations and have been relentlessly driving efficiency through resource optimization and waste
reduction and thereby reducing our ecological footprint. this has allowed us to decouple our business growth
from the environmental impact and reduce costs.

tcs’ environmental stewardship can be seen through four dimensions:

n carbon footprint reduction : energy efficiency and use of renewable energy
n water management: efficient use, recycling and rainwater harvesting,
n waste management: reduction, reuse and recycling
n supply chain sustainability

all these initiatives are implemented through our environment management system framework, in accordance
with the international standard, iso 14001:2004. tcs’ key delivery centers at 113 locations around the world are
certified to this standard.

environmental expenditure

at tcs, environmental initiatives are seen as part of the overall operational and infrastructure improvement, and,
therefore, the expenditure is not tracked separately. green building project costs are included in our capital
expenditure, while monitoring and measurement and small energy efficiency project costs, and compliance fees
are included as a part of operational budgets for the respective facilities.

compliance

tcs complies with all applicable environmental regulations. there were no instances of environmental fines
imposed or negative consequences due to tcs’ operations in the reporting period.

exhibit 13 summarizes the various elements of our environmental management. our performance⁵ in fy 2016-17
against the various environmental goals we have set for ourselves is depicted in exhibit 14.

                                      reducing the carbon footprint
                                      in fy 2007-08, our greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 + scope 2)⁶ stood at 3 tco2e/fte/annum. using that as a
                                      baseline, the company has been pursuing a bold target to reduce the specific carbon footprint by 50% by 2020.

                                      scope 2 emissions, resulting from purchased electricity, make up 90% of our total carbon emissions.
                                      consequently, in working towards reducing our carbon footprint, we have primarily targeted our energy
                                      consumption and found ways to make it more efficient and greener.

                                      our carbon management approach has four key levers – green infrastructure, green it, it-enabled operational
                                      efficiencies, and greater use of renewable energy.

                                      green infrastructure:

                                      all new campuses owned by tcs are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource
                                      efficiency. currently, nearly 50% of tcs’ total real estate portfolio is certified green building space, and 78% of the
                                      total tcs-owned real estate is igbc/leed-certified green infrastructure. thirteen tcs campuses from across the
                                      country now boast of leed certification (exhibit 15).

                                      key features of our green buildings include energy efficient design, onsite renewable energy via rooftop solar
                                      photovoltaic (pv) panels, solar thermal installations, chiller waste heat recovery units, and solar pv panel-based
                                      peripheral lighting systems.

                                      energy efficiency is a key criterion even when we lease new spaces. new office spaces that we have leased in
                                      gurgaon, noida, kolkata, mumbai, pune, and munich all have green building certification.




      g4-dma (energy); g4-dma (emissions)
     ⁶scope 1 emissions such as those from diesel-operated generator sets, company-owned vehicles, fugitive emissions like refrigerant gases, cooking gas combustion, and office heating
      have been calculated using the emissions factors published by the ghg (greenhouse) protocol all sector tools version released in 2017. for scope 2 emissions – that is, purchased
      electricity-related carbon emissions – for india, the source is the emissions factor in the co2 baseline database for the indian power sector, user guide, version 11.0, april 2016,
     published by the central electricity authority of india. for scope 2 emissions of locations other than india, emission factors published by defra 2015 have been used.
     g4-en3, g4-en4 - in fy 2016-17, tcs consumed 600.3 gwh (2.3 million gj) of electricity out of which 7.25% was from renewable sources, 3% from onsite utilities and the remaining was
     purchased electricity. energy consumption outside the organization has not been measured.

green it:

procurement of energy-efficient assets, operational energy management, eco-friendly disposal of end-of-life it
equipment through e-waste management, and other such initiatives together make tcs’ green it strategy.

some of the best practices deployed at the data centers include redesigning air flow by proper placement of
supply grill tiles, blocking cold air leakages, and optimizing cooling and uninterruptible power supply (ups)
devices by switching off extra units. with the integration of 23 key data centers on an online monitoring and
control platform, we are now able to track our power usage on a real-time basis to drive efficiency measures
accordingly. consequently, we have improved the power usage effectiveness (pue) at our data centers from an
average of 2.2 to 1.73, with six centers having a pue of 1.65 or less.

remote energy management:

tcs has developed a cloud-based energy-management-as-a-service platform that leverages tcs ip, internet of
things, machine learning and predictive analytics to monitor energy consumption on a real time basis, detect
anomalies and identify ways to reduce consumption. this solution has been deployed at over 150 of our facilities
across india, and enterprise-wide energy consumption is monitored and optimized from our centralized
resource operations center in kochi.

                                          renewable energy:

                                          tcs has set a target of meeting 20% of our energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2020. apart from
                                          rooftop solar power installations, some of our offices feature smaller renewable energy installations, including
                                          solar peripheral lights, solar electrical fencing systems, and solar water heaters. natural gas is used at some
                                          overseas locations for space heating. tcs is looking at procuring renewable energy through third-party providers
                                          over the next few years. in fy 2016-17, renewable energy accounted for 7.25% of total energy consumed.

                                          outcomes:

                                          on account of all the efficiency-focused initiatives, we have reduced our specific electricity consumption in
                                          fy 2016-17 by 8.35% over fy 2015-16, and 49.15% over baseline year fy 2007-08 (exhibit 17) .

respectively.


water sustainability
recognizing the limited supply of fresh water and the importance of water conservation for sustaining our
operations, tcs has set itself an ambitious goal of achieving water neutrality by 2020. towards this, we have put in
place water-efficient design at new offices and campuses, ensuring 100% treatment and recycling of sewage
and rainwater harvesting. employee engagement also plays a big role in our water sustainability strategy.
exhibit 22 summarizes our water management initiatives and performance.

of the 3.9 million kl of fresh water consumed by tcs in fy 2016-17, 46% came from municipal sources, 38% from
tankers, 15% from borewells, and 1% was bottled water. consistent water efficiency measures have helped us
reduce fresh water consumption by 15% over baseline year fy 2007-08. however, our reported consumption
figures increased marginally over the past year due to the inclusion of new sites through m&a activity.

recycling:

to reduce the load on fresh water sources, all new tcs campuses are equipped with sewage treatment plants
designed for 100% recycling of the treated sewage. sewage is treated using state-of-the-art technologies and
recycled for use in hvac cooling towers, flush tanks, and irrigation (in that order of preference). newer tcs
facilities are designed for zero water discharge and have significantly boosted overall recycling levels. hence,
total treated sewage recycled as a percentage of the total fresh water consumed has gone up from 44% in
fy 2015-16 to 53% in fy 2016-17.

                                          rainwater harvesting:

                                          we intend to return to nature the water we draw from it, using rainwater harvesting within our campuses.
                                          accordingly, our premises feature rainwater harvesting infrastructure, including rooftop collection systems,
                                          collection and storage tanks, mechanism for recharging of bore wells, trenches, and pits, and, in some cases,
                                          water bodies for storing rainwater. there was a 25% increase in the rainwater harvesting potential at tcs sites in
                                          fy 2016-17 over the previous year. our current rainwater harvesting potential offsets 100% of the total
                                          groundwater used across tcs facilities.


                                          waste management
                                          for an it services and consulting organization like tcs, emissions and wastes are limited, and primarily come from
                                          our office operations – there are no process wastes or emissions. municipal solid waste is the predominant type of
                                          waste generated, along with electronic and electrical waste (e-waste), and relatively small amounts of hazardous
                                          waste like lead-acid batteries and waste lube oil.

                                          tcs’ 3r waste management model is based on reduction, reuse and recycling. reduction at source is the most
                                          important lever, and we are pursuing this by raising employee awareness and encouraging responsible
                                          consumption. in fy 2016-17, we generated 141 tons of paper waste, 1,969 tons of dry waste, and 3,192 tons of
                                          canteen waste, all adding up to 21.7 kg/fte/annum of waste. ¹¹




                                          exhibit 23: this notice board put up at a canteen at tcs bangalore very effectively drove home the message to
                                          employees. the image itself went viral on social media and introduced the issue of food wastage into the national
                                          discourse.

                                          biodegradable waste is subjected to onsite treatment for biogas recovery through bio-digesters or compost pits;
                                          or disposed of as feed to piggeries, or to the municipal waste collection system. the choice is based on the space
                                          available and the estimated food waste generated. in fy 2016-17, 27.4% of the total wet waste generated was
                                          treated through onsite composting. approximately 185.6 ton of compost was generated from garden waste the
                                          same fiscal. this compost serves as an excellent bio-fertilizer that helps avoid the use of chemical fertilizers, and
                                          resultant soil and groundwater pollution.

                                          continuous efforts to reduce paper usage at source has translated into a specific paper consumption of 38
                                          reams/1000 fte/month in fy 2016-17, an 83.57% reduction over the baseline year. much of this reduction can be
                                          attributed to the awareness created among employees, and the enforcement of printing discipline through
                                          automated and manual administrative means. paper waste is carefully segregated, shredded, recycled. in some
                                          cases, it is sent to ngos, which supply stationery items made from recycled paper back to us. in fy 2016-17,
                                          tcs continued to achieve 100% recycling of total paper waste.¹⁰

e-waste management

in fy 2016-17, 26,428 scrapped it assets were disposed of through government authorized handlers or recyclers,
in accordance with the regulations of each country.¹² to ensure that electronic waste is recycled appropriately,
our e-waste recycling service providers undergo a stringent due-diligence audit process to ensure compliance
with health, safety, and environment (hse)-related regulations and follow good onsite handling practices. a
desktop review is followed by a detailed site audit to verify adherence to hse practices, thereby extending 'duty
of care' to the supply chain. the e-waste management processes followed are in line with the waste electrical and
electronic equipment (weee) directive, government of india's e-waste (management and handling) rules, 2011,
and other country-level regulations.

hazardous waste management

for india operations, hazardous waste (as defined by applicable regulations) is handled and disposed of as per
hazardous and other waste (management and transboundary movement) rules, 2016, only through
government-authorized vendors. all used printer cartridges and photocopier toner bottles are sent back to the
manufacturers for proper disposal. in fy 2016-17, 30,177 liters of lube oil from diesel generator sets and
10,414 batteries from ups systems were disposed of through government authorized recyclers. ¹³


employee engagement
our employees play a critical role in helping us achieve our sustainability objectives. we engage them through
different channels and during campaigns spread out across the year. as part of tcs' 'step up the earth hour'
campaign, launched in may 2016, all non-essential and non-critical lights and electrical equipment were turned
off on the last saturday of each month, without compromising business operations. this initiative was a huge
success, and helped us avoid generation of more than 185 ton of co2 equivalent.

since its inception in 2014, the tata group campaign, 'tata sustainability month' has grown in terms of both
outreach and impact. in june 2016, the theme for this initiative was the sustainability development goals. over
160,000 employees participated in both online and onsite activities.


supply chain sustainability
in keeping with the tata group philosophy, we expect our key suppliers and supply chain partners to incorporate
socially and environmentally responsible practices in their businesses. we strive to integrate sustainability
considerations in our vendor selection and engagement process (see exhibit 24).




¹²data for all geographies.
  g4-en24. there were no reported spills in fy 2016-17.
¹³in all geographies, we follow local regulations. since most of the facilities outside india are typically smaller, and leased and operated by landlords, the generation of such waste is
  marginal and is appropriately handled through the landlords or facility managers.

             compliance to legal requirements is set as the minimum requirement, while additional elements include
             mandatory sign-offs on tcs’ supplier code of conduct and contractor hse requirements, assessments and audits
             for high-risk vendors, integration of sustainability metrics in vendor reviews, and training and capacity building.
             site or process audits are conducted for high-risk vendors with direct impact on tcs, while desktop assessments
             are conducted for those whose impact on tcs is indirect. together, all these efforts illustrate tcs’ overarching
             commitment to environmental sustainability.


                                                     green stationery at tcs hungary

                       tcs hungary rolled out a green stationery catalogue to make stationery procurement more
                    sustainable. the sustainability criteria were defined based on the material they were made out of,
                   packaging, reusability factor, and transportation involved. green alternatives were then sought from
                   vendors, a catalogue created and shared with employees to create awareness. the logistics process
                                         was also streamlined to reduce wastage and save energy.
