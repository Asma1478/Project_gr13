     the coverage of energy and associated ghg disclosure is 98% of gla owned and under operative control. the figures are based on measured consumption, estimates are not used.


     1)	citycon’s reported energy consumption covers shopping centres and other retail properties where citycon’s share of ownership is at least 50% and where citycon has operational control. kista galleria's
         environmental data is included in its entirety for 2014and 2015. kista galleria’s environmental data is not included for previous years. figures include citycon norway entire year data 2015.
     2)	citycon also reports the tenants' electricity consumption in cases where citycon is responsible for electricity procurement. when energy procurement is on tenant’s responsibility, it has been excluded
         from reporting.
     3)	energy used for heating and cooling is reported in its entirety.
     4)	in terms of intensity figures, citycon has limited the reported electricity consumption to common areas, where it can directly influence. this includes the electricity used for general lighting, ventilation
         and cooling, as well as lifts and escalators and other building technical systems.
     5)	excl. fruängen centrum, högdalen centrum, myllypuro, heikintori, glasshuspassasjen, krokstad senter and lade where amount of visitors is not collected
     6)	the reported consumption includes the headquarters and citycon norway office, other offices are integrated into shopping centres. headquarters’ heating, water and waste amounts are excluded
         from reporting as they are included in the rent and not reported separately to citycon.
     7) fuels include oil, gas and biofuel. biofuel (renewable) represents <2% of fuel consumption.
     8) baseline corrected intensity includes citycon norway data 2014, in addition the intensity is calculated with weather corrected heating consumption.

           epra initial yields decreased mostly due to fair value change during the year, resulting from

           in the completed property portfolio either (such as property disposals, and started/completed
