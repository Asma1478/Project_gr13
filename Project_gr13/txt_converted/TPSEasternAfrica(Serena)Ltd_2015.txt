corporate governance statement
the board of directors of tps eastern africa limited (tpseal/ “the company” ) is responsible for formulation of the company’s policies
and oversight of implementation of those policies, overall management of company’s operations, strategic direction, and governance
of tpseal and its subsidiaries (“tps group”). the board is accountable to the group’s shareholders for ensuring that the company
complies with the provisions of the law. the tps group has built its business on very strong corporate governance principles based on
the application of high and consistent ethical standards in its relationship with its clients, employees, and other stakeholders, at large.
this is consistent with the tps group’s core values of effective corporate governance that has led to a strong commitment to conduct
business in accordance with the best business practices based on the principles of accountability, responsibility, sound risk management,
and compliance with relevant laws and regulations, appropriate checks and balances and delivery on commitment to all stakeholders.
the company has complied with nairobi securities exchange (nse) requirements under the continuing listing obligations and the
guidelines on good corporate governance practices by public listed companies in kenya as issued by the capital markets authority
(cma) (the cma guidelines). in this respect, the directors of the company have committed the board to ensuring that the integrity of
internal systems remains a key pillar to enhancement of the group’s financial performance and sustainability.
the board of directors
as at 31 december, 2014, the board consisted of 11 substantive directors and 2 alternate directors. the chairman is a non-executive
director. a majority of the directors are non-executive and independent. there are two executive directors, i.e. the managing director and
the finance director. re-election and appointment of directors are subject to the provisions of the company’s articles of association and
cma guidelines. the directors have a wide range of business and professional skills and experience and each contributes independently
to the board’s deliberations. in terms of the board charter, the directors meet at least four (4) times a year.
in reference to the period under review, (four) 4 scheduled board meetings were held. special board meetings are held to deliberate on
urgent issues of strategic importance, or as required under the statute, or in compliance with the requirements of regulatory authorities.
management gives the directors adequate notice for meetings and timely information so that they can contribute constructively and
knowledgeably at board meetings. this enables them to maintain effective oversight and control over strategic, financial, operational, and
compliance issues. the separation of the board’s non-executive, independent chairman’s role from that of the group’s management has
obviated the possibility of conflict between the functions of the chairman and the executive managing director. in turn, this separation
has resulted in creating in-built checks and balances. by assuming an active leadership role, the board aims to maximize shareholders’
value and ensure long-term sustainability of the tps group as a whole.
at the last annual general meeting held on 28th may, 2014, mrs. teddy mapunda, mr. guedi ainache, mr. ameer kassim-lakha and mr.
jack jacob kisa were re-elected to the tpseal board.
on 30th july, 2014, mr. mahmood manji was appointed to join the tpseal board. mr. manji had previously served on the tpseal board
and had resigned as a director of the company to avoid a possible conflict of interest as he was, at the same time, a director of the cma
board.
the directors’ attendance of the (four) 4 board meetings held during 2014 was as follows:
                                                                                                             no: of board meetings

oversight role of the board of directors
as noted above, the board primarily provides direction on the general policy and oversight in respect of the group’s overall internal
controls, strategy, finance, operations, budgets and compliance issues in order to provide sustainable returns to the shareholders. reviews
are done periodically to compare actual performance against set targets and corrective measures, if any, taken so as to ensure that the
business performance is on budget.
committees of the board
the board has set up two main committees and has delegated specific mandates to each one of them. the two committees, namely, board
audit committee and board nomination and remuneration committee, have been established under formal written terms of reference
(tor) as set out by the board. the number of committees and the respective tor are reviewed from time to time so as to respond to
the dynamic business environment and comply with the ever-changing legislation and regulations. the committees meet regularly as
provided in their respective tor.
board audit committee
members of this committee comprised of mr. ameer kassim-lakha (chairman), mr. jean-louis vinciguerra, mr. guedi ainache, and
mr. mahmood manji. the committee works closely with the internal audit department and external auditors. it plays a critical role in
reviewing financial information and ensuring that the system of internal controls is effectively administered and reviewed as appropriate.
during the year under review, the committee reviewed significant audit findings identified by the group’s internal and external auditors
and followed up implementation of necessary actions.
the board authorized the committee, within its tor, to directly seek from company’s employees any information on any matters and to
seek independent professional advice whenever necessary. the board also reviewed the membership of the board audit committee
during the year under review in accordance with cma guidelines as well as the committee’s own tor. during the period under review,
the tpseal board nominated mr. mahmood manji to join the board audit committee thus bringing the membership of the committee
to a total of four (4). the committee held two (2) meetings during the year under review. the external auditors and executive directors
attended the committee’s meetings as required. every year the board audit committee meets the external auditors in the absence of the
executive directors and members of the management team.

corporate governance statement (continued)
the committee initiated the strengthening of the group’s risk assessment processes aimed at mitigating and reducing the various business
risks. the ultimate aim was to finalize the enterprise risk management policy which the board is to adopt formally in due course. the
exercise is aimed at harmonizing and aligning the policy to address the increasingly risk prone current dynamic business environment.
nomination and remuneration committee
the committee’s membership consists of mr. jack kisa (chairman), mr. guedi ainache, dr. ramadhani dau, mr. mahmood manji, and
mrs. teddy mapunda. by its own tor, the committee is mandated to consult experts, where necessary, to scrutinize the company’s
organizational structure and staff establishments and to recommend to the board appropriate human resources policies and capacity
enhancement. the committee held two (2) scheduled meetings during 2014. in 2014, the tpseal board nominated mr. mahmood manji
and mrs. teddy mapunda to join the nomination and remuneration committee thus bringing the total membership of the committee to
five (5).
the board mandated the committee to propose nominees for appointment to the board as may be required from time to time, and
to assess the effectiveness of the board as a whole, committees of the board, as well as each individual director and make necessary
recommendations to the board for enhancing the overall effectiveness of the board.
the committee conducts a performance evaluation exercise after every two years aimed at evaluating the performance of the board, the
chairman, the managing director and individual directors. any weaknesses revealed by the results are addressed with a view to improving
the board’s overall performance.
internal controls
the company has a well-defined organizational structure with appropriate segregation of duties and responsibilities. this is complemented
by detailed policy and procedure manuals, which provide an operational framework for the management team. the company update
periodically policy and procedures manuals to incorporate any subsequent changes and ensure that they remain relevant to the group’s
operational requirements. in 2014, the company carried out a comprehensive review of the financial, and information & communication
technology policies and procedures manuals in view of the changing business dynamics. to this end, the company held monthly review
meetings, monthly credit control, sales and marketing, and finance review meetings focusing on critical aspects of the company’s operations.
the internal control function is largely complemented by the internal audit function, which is an independent appraisal and review
function whose recommendations are discussed and adopted where necessary. in 2014, the company invested in an audit programme
– ‘teammate audit management system’ which helped in leveraging the existing audit expertise, harmonizing and strengthening risk
management, and effectiveness of internal control processes across the group.
communication with shareholders and stakeholders
the company is committed to ensuring that management provides shareholders, securities & bond markets, and other stakeholders with
accurate and timely information on the company’s performance. this is done through the distribution of the tpseal annual report
at least 21 days before the annual general meeting, release of half-year and end-year financial results through the print media and
regulatory bodies, and issuance of monthly disclosures of shareholding statistics to the nairobi securities exchange (nse) and the capital
markets authority (cma).
shareholders and other stakeholders have a direct access to the company’s information through the internet and management responds
to all enquiries in a timely manner. management also updates regularly the serena website so as to provide current information on
the company’s affairs. in this regard, during the period under review the company also complied with its obligations under the nse
continuing listing rules and the cma act.
by maintaining an open-door policy in terms of communication both at board and management levels, the company ensures that enquiries
from shareholders and other stakeholders are addressed expeditiously.

notes to the financial statements
1 general information
   tps eastern africa limited is incorporated in kenya under the companies act as a public limited liability company and is domiciled in
   kenya. the address of its registered office is:
   		
   williamson house
   4th ngong avenue
   po box 48690
   00100 nairobi
   kenya

   the company’s shares are listed on the nairobi securities exchange.
   for the kenya companies act reporting purposes, the balance sheet is represented by the statement of financial position and profit and
   loss account by the income statement in these financial statements.

2 summary of significant accounting policies
    the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. these policies have been
    consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
(a) basis of preparation
    the financial statements are prepared in compliance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs). the measurement
    basis applied is the historical cost basis, except where otherwise stated in the accounting policies below. the financial statements are
    presented in kenya shillings (shs), rounded to the nearest thousands, except where otherwise indicated.

   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. it also requires
   management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies. the areas involving a higher degree
   of judgement or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.

changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(a) new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the group
   the following standards have been adopted by the group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 january 2014
   and have a material impact on the group:

   amendment to ias 32, ‘financial instruments: presentation’ on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. this amendment
   clarifies that the right of set-off must not be contingent on a future event. it must also be legally enforceable for all counterparties in
   the normal course of business, as well as in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy. the amendment also considers settlement
   mechanisms. the amendment did not have a significant effect on the group financial statements.

   amendments to ias 36, ‘impairment of assets’, on the recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets. this amendment
   removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of cgus which had been included in ias36 by the issue of ifrs 13.

notes to the financial statements (continued)

2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(a) basis of preparation (continued)
changes in accounting policy and disclosures (continued)
(a) new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the group (continued)
   amendment to ias 39, ‘financial instruments: recognition and measurement’ on the novation of derivatives and the continuation of
   hedge accounting. this amendment considers legislative changes to ‘over-the-counter’ derivatives and the establishment of central
   counterparties. under ias 39 novation of derivatives to central counterparties would result in discontinuance of hedge accounting. the
   amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument meets specified criteria. the
   group has applied the amendment and there has been no significant impact on the group financial statements as a result.

   ifric 21, ‘levies’, sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of ias 37 ‘provisions’. the
   interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognised. the group
   is not currently subjected to significant levies so the impact on the group is not material.

   other standards, amendments and interpretations which are effective for the financial year beginning on 1 january, 2014 are not
   material to the group.

(b) new standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
   a number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1
   january 2014, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. none of these is expected to have a
   significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group, except the following set out below:

   ifrs 9, ‘financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
   the complete version of ifrs 9 was issued in july, 2014. it replaces the guidance in ias 39 that relates to the classification and
   measurement of financial instruments. ifrs 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary
   measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through oci and fair value through p&l. the basis of
   classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. investments
   in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception present
   changes in fair value in oci not recycling. there is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment
   model used in ias 39.

   for financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit
   risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. ifrs 9 relaxes the requirements for
   hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. it requires an economic relationship between the hedged
   item and hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management
   purposes.
   contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under ias 39. the standard is effective for
   accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018. early adoption is permitted. the group is yet to assess ifrs 9’s full impact.

notes to the financial statements (continued)
2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

   ifrs 15, ‘revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful
   information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
   from an entity’s contracts with customers. revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has
   the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. the standard replaces ias 18 ‘revenue’ and ias 11
   ‘construction contracts’ and related interpretations. the standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2017
   and earlier application is permitted. the group is assessing the impact of ifrs 15.

    there are no other ifrss or ifric interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the
    group.
(b) consolidation
(i) subsidiaries
   subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. the group controls an entity when the
   group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
   through its power over the entity. subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. they
   are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

   the group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. the consideration transferred for the acquisition of
   a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity
   interests issued by the group. the consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
   consideration arrangement. identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
   measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. the group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an
   acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts
   of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

   acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
   if the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in
   the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised
   in profit or loss.

   	any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. subsequent changes to
   the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with ias 39 either
   in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured,
   and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

   inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. unrealised losses
   are also eliminated. when necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the group’s accounting
   policies.

notes to the financial statements (continued)
2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(b) consolidation (continued)
(i) subsidiaries (continued)
     acquisition of entities under common control is accounted for using predecessor accounting.
(ii) changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
     transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, as
     transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. the difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant
     share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling
     interests are also recorded in equity.
(iii) disposal of subsidiaries
    when the group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is
    lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. the fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of
    subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. in addition, any amounts previously
    recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related
    assets or liabilities. this may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(iv) associates
   associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of
   between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. under
   the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the
   investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. the group’s investment in associates includes goodwill
   identified on acquisition.

   if the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts
   previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.

   the group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements
   in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount
   of the investment. when the group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other
   unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made
   payments on behalf of the associate.

   the group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired.
   if this is the case, the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate
   and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of associates in the income statement.

   profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the group and its associate are recognised in the
   group’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the associates. unrealised losses are eliminated

notes to the financial statements (continued)

2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(b) consolidation (continued)
(iv) associates (continued)
   unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. accounting policies of associates have been changed
   where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group. dilution gains and losses arising in investments in
   associates are recognised in the income statement.
(v) joint arrangements
  the group applies ifrs 11 to all joint arrangements. under ifrs 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint
  operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor. ifrs gaap plc has assessed the nature
  of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

  under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise
  the group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.

  when the group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term
  interests that, in substance, form part of the group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the group does not recognise further losses,
  unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

   unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the
   joint ventures. unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
   accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the
   group.
(vi) separate financial statements
   in the separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted for at cost less impairment. cost is
   adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments. cost also includes direct attributable
   costs of investment.

   dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(c) functional currency and translation of foreign currencies
(i) functional and presentation currency
   items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
   environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). the consolidated financial statements are presented in kenya
   shillings, which is the company’s functional and presentation currency.		
(ii) transactions and balances
   foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions
   or valuation where items are re-measured. foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and
   from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in
   the income statement.

notes to the financial statements (continued)
2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(c) functional currency and translation of foreign currencies (continued)
(ii) transactions and balances (continued)
   foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in the income statement within ‘finance income or cost’. all
   other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within ‘other operating income’ or ‘other expenses’.

   translation differences related to changes in amortised cost are recognised in the income statement, and other changes in carrying
   amount are recognised in other comprehensive income.

     translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are
     recognised in the income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss. translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such
     as equities classified as available-for-sale financial assets, are included in other comprehensive income.		
(iii) group companies
   the results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have
   a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

  (i) assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting
        period;
  (ii) income and expenses for each income statement amount are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not
        a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and
        expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and
  (iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the currency translation reserve.

   on consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to other
   comprehensive income. when a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that are recorded in equity are
   recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

    goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
    entity and translated at the closing rate.
(d) segment reporting
    operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker
    (codm). the codm who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments has been
    identified as the managing director who makes strategic decisions.
(e) revenue recognition
    revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course
    of the group’s activities. revenue is shown net of value-added tax (vat), returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales
    within the group. the group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future
    economic benefits will flow to the group and when specific criteria have been met for each of the group’s activities as described below.

    the group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the
    specifics of each arrangement.
    revenue is recognised as follows:
    (i) sales of goods are recognised in the period in which the group has delivered products to the customer, and there is no unfulfilled
          obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. delivery does not occur until the products have been
          accepted by the customer.
    (ii) sales of services are recognised in the period in which the services are rendered, by reference to completion of the specific
          transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a percentage of the total services to be provided.
    (iii) interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
    (iv) dividends are recognised as income in the period in which the right to receive payment is established.

(f) property, plant and equipment
    all categories of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. land and buildings are subsequently shown at fair value,
    based on periodic, but at least every five year, valuations by external independent valuers, less subsequent depreciation for buildings.
    all other property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. historical cost includes expenditure that is
    directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

   subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable
   that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. all
   other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

   increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation are credited to a revaluation surplus reserve in equity. decreases that offset
   previous increases of the same asset are charged against the revaluation surplus; all other decreases are charged to profit or loss. each
   year the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset (the depreciation charged to profit or loss)
   and depreciation based on the asset’s original cost is transferred from the revaluation surplus to retained earnings.

   depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight line method to write down their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values
   over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

                                                 useful life                                   residual values
    land and buildings                           over the period of the lease                  35%
    computers                                    3-4 years                                     -
    motor vehicles                               4 years                                       -
    furniture and fittings                       10 years                                      25%
    lift installations                           10 years                                      25%
    laundry equipment                            10 years                                      25%

   the assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(f) property, plant and equipment (continued)
    on opening of a new unit, initial purchases of operating equipment, such as crockery and beddings are capitalised at cost and subsequent
    replacements to maintain operating equipment at par stock level are expensed in the year of purchase. carrying values are validated
    every three years.
   an asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater
   than its estimated recoverable amount.
   gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are included
   in profit or loss. on disposal of revalued assets, amounts in the revaluation surplus relating to that asset are transferred to retained
   earnings.
(g) intangible assets
    goodwill
    	goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and represents the excess of the consideration
    transferred over the company’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
    acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree.

   for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cgus, or groups of
   cgus, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated
   represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. goodwill is
   monitored at the operating segment level.

    goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential
    impairment. the carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair
    value less costs to sell. any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
(h) impairment of non-financial assets
    	assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use- are not subject to amortisation
    and are tested annually for impairment. assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognised for the amount
    by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value
    less costs to sell and value in use.
   for the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
   (cash-generating units). non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the
   impairment at each reporting date.
(i) financial assets		
(i) classification
  the group classifies its financial assets under loans and receivables. the classification depends on the purpose for which the financial
  assets were acquired. management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates such
  designation periodically.

2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(i) financial assets (continued)
loans and receivables
   loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value (plus transaction costs) and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
   effective interest method. they are included in current assets, loans and receivables are included in receivables and prepayments in
   the statement of financial position.
(ii) offsetting financial instruments
   financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally
   enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the
   liability simultaneously.
(iii) impairment of financial assets
   assets carried at amortised cost
   the group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
   assets is impaired. a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is
   objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’)
   and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that
   can be reliably estimated.

   	evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty,
   default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation,
   and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears
   or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.

    for loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the
    present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial
    asset’s original effective interest rate. the carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit
    or loss. if a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest
    rate determined under the contract. as a practical expedient, the group and company may measure impairment on the basis of an
    instrument’s fair value using an observable market price.
(j) accounting for leases
    leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
    payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

    the group leases certain property, plant and equipment. leases of property, plant and equipment where the group has substantially
    all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at
    the lower of the fair value of the lease property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
(k) inventories
    inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. cost is determined by the weighted average method and computed
    as the cost of purchase plus any incidental costs incurred in bringing inventory items to their present location. net realisable value
    is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses. inventories
    mainly comprise hotel consumables, food and beverage items.

2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(l) receivables
   trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. if
   collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are a classified as current
   assets. if not, they are presented as non-current assets.

   trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
   method, less provision for impairment (note i).

   receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from financial assets has expired or where the company has
   transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
(m) payables
   trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
   accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the
   business if longer). if not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

    payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
    payables are derecognised when extinguished.
(n) share capital
    ordinary shares are classified as ‘share capital’ in equity. any premium received over and above the par value of the shares is classified
    as ‘share premium’ in equity.
(o) cash and cash equivalents
    in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other
    short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. bank overdrafts are shown
    within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of financial position.
(p) employee benefits
(i) retirement benefit obligations
   for unionised employees, the group has an unfunded obligation to pay terminal gratuities under its collective bargaining agreement
   with the union. employees who resign after serving for periods of between five years and ten years, receive eighteen days salary and
   house allowance for each completed year of service at the rate of pay applicable at the date of resigning. those who resign after serving
   for more than ten years receive twenty four days salary and house allowance for each completed year of service. the defined benefit
   obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.

   the group in kenya operates a defined contribution post-employment benefit scheme for all its permanent employees after their first
   year of employment. the assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund, which is funded by contributions from
   both the group and the employees. the group and all its permanent employees also contribute to the statutory national social security

   funds, which are defined contribution schemes. the group’s contributions to both these defined contribution schemes are charged to
   the income statement in the year in which they fall due. the group has no further obligation once the contributions have been paid.

   the estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the reporting date is recognised as an expense
   accrual.

2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(p) employee benefits (continued)
(ii) termination benefits
    termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal retirement date, or whenever
    an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. the group recognises termination benefits when it
    is demonstrably committed to a termination when the entity has a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current
    employees without possibility of withdrawal. in the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits
    are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end
    of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
(q) current and deferred income tax
    the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. tax is recognised in the income statement except to the
    extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. in this case, the tax is also recognised
    in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

   the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. management
   periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to
   interpretation. it establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
   		
   deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
   liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements. however, if the deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they
   arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or
   liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable
   profit or loss. deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
   reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax liability is settled.

   deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
   which the temporary differences can be utilised.

   deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the
   timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
   reverse in the foreseeable future.

    deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current
    tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on
    either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
(r) borrowings
    borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised
    cost using the effective interest method; any differences between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
    recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.

   borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at
   least 12 months after the reporting date.

2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(s) dividend distribution
    dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared. dividends
    are declared upon approval at the annual general meeting. proposed dividends are disclosed separately within equity until declared.
(t) comparatives
    where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation in the current year.

3 critical accounting estimates and judgements
    	estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including experience of
    future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
(i) critical accounting estimates and assumptions
   the group and company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. the resulting accounting estimates will, by
   definition, seldom equal the related actual results. the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
   adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
   impairment of goodwill
   the group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note
   2(h). the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. these calculations
   require the use of estimates (note 20).
   income taxes
   the group is subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. significant judgement is required in determining the group’s provision
   for income taxes. there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the
   ordinary course of business. the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional
   taxes will be due. where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such
   differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
   gratuity scheme obligations
   the present value of the gratuity obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number
   of assumptions. the assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) for gratuity include the discount rate and future salary
   increases. any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of gratuity obligations.

     the group relies on an independent actuary to determine the appropriate discount rate at the end of the year. this is the interest rate
     that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension
     obligations.
     		
     other key assumptions for gratuity obligations are based in part on current market conditions. additional information is disclosed in
     note 16.
(ii) critical judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies
   in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, management has made judgements in determining:
   • the classification of financial assets and leases
   • whether financial and non-financial assets are impaired.

4 financial risk management		
   the group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including credit risk and the effects of changes in debt and equity
   market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. the group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the
   unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.

     financial risk management is carried out by the board of directors under the guidance of management. board of directors identifies,
     evaluates and hedges financial risks. the board of directors provides guidance on principles for overall risk management covering
     specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments
     and investment of excess liquidity.
     		
market risk
(i) foreign exchange risk
   the group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with
   respect to the us dollar. foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net
   investments in foreign operations.
   		
   the group aims to minimise volatility arising from fluctuations in exchange rates by adopting natural hedges such as holding cash
   balances in foreign currencies to hedge against any foreign currency denominated amounts payable. 		

     the group manages foreign exchange risk by converting its foreign currency collections into local currency on an ongoing basis to
     cater for its operational requirements. as a result, the group does not hold large amounts of foreign currency deposits. in addition, the
     group receives its collections in foreign currency and therefore any future foreign currency commercial transactions are settled in the
     same currency to avoid the effect of swinging currency exchange rates.
     		
     currency exposure arising from the net assets of foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the
     relevant foreign currencies.
     		
     at 31 december 2014, if the shilling had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the us dollar with all other variables held constant,
     consolidated post tax profit for the year would have been shs 7,863,939 (2013: shs 14,724,043 ) higher/lower, mainly as a result of
     us dollar receivables, payables and bank balances.
(ii) price risk
     the group does not have any assets subject to price risk as at 31 december 2014 (2013: nil).
(iii) cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
   the group has borrowings at variable rates. the group does not hedge itself against interest rate risk. no limits are placed on the ratio
   of variable rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing. at 31 december 2014, an increase/decrease of 10% on interest rate would have
   resulted in an increase/decrease in consolidated post tax profit of shs 22,746,492 (2013: 14,774,186).
credit risk
   credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposures to
   customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its
   contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group.

2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
credit risk (continued)
   the credit controller is responsible for managing and analysing credit risk for each new customer before standard payment and delivery
   terms are offered. credit risk arises from cash at bank and short term deposits with banks, as well as trade and other receivables. the
   group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk.
   for banks and financial institutions, only reputable well established financial institutions are accepted. for trade receivables, the
   credit controller assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
   the utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
   the maximum exposure for credit risk equals the amounts disclosed on the statement of financial position in 2014 and 2013.
   related party and other receivables are neither past due nor impaired. the group’s bankers are reputable and sound financial
   institutions.
   there were no assets that are past due or impaired except for the following amounts in trade receivables (which are due within 30 days
   of the end of the month in which they are invoiced):

liquidity risk
  prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash securities, and the availability of funding from an adequate
  amount of committed credit facilities. due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, management maintains flexibility in
  funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines. management monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity reserve
  on the basis of expected cash flows.
 the table below analyses the group’s and the company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining
 period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity date. the amounts disclosed in the table below are the contractual undiscounted
 cash flows. balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances, as the impact of discounting is not significant.

capital risk management
 the group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
 returns for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. in order to maintain or adjust the
 capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new capital or sell assets to reduce debt.
 during 2014 the group’s strategy, which was unchanged from 2013, was to maintain a gearing ratio between 25% and 40%. the
 gearing ratios at 31 december 2014 and 2013 as follows:
                                                                                                                   2014               2013

5 segment information
  management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the managing director that are used to make
  strategic decisions.
 the managing director considers the business from both a geographic and product perspective. geographically, management considers
 the performance in kenya, uganda and tanzania. kenya is further segregated into hotels and lodges.
 the reportable operating segments derive their revenue primarily from accommodation, food and beverage sales.
 the managing director assesses the performance of the operating segments based on profits before depreciation and amortisation,
 interest and tax, which is a measure of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda). the measure also
 excludes the effects of unrealised gains/losses on financial instruments. interest income and expenditure are not allocated to segments,
 as this type of activity is driven by the central treasury function, which manages the cash position of the group.
 the segment information provided to the managing director for the reportable segments for the year ended 31 december 2014 is as
 follows:
                                                               kenya        kenya      tanzania      uganda         all other

10 earnings per share
basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
                                                                                                                    2014                  2013

the carrying amounts of short-term borrowings approximate to their fair value. fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a
discount rate based upon the borrowing rate that directors expect would be available to the group at the balance sheet date.
it is impracticable to assign fair values to the group’s long term liabilities due to inability to forecast interest rate and foreign exchange
rate changes.
none of the above borrowings was in default at any time in the year.

under ias 19 revised, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the other comprehensive income. consistent with prior year, actuarial
losses have been charged to income statement on the basis of materiality.
assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice, published statistics and experience in the industry.
the directors do not anticipate variation of the assumptions to impact the obligations significantly. in the opinion of the directors, the
provision for gratuity entitlement for employees fairly reflects the group’s future obligation under the terms of the collective bargaining
agreement.
the scheme has no dedicated assets.
the kenyan company ceased operating the unfunded gratuity scheme and transferred the amount held to a pension scheme.

services (kenya) limited, tourism promotion services (tanzania) limited & tourism promotion services (zanzibar) limited were all
revalued on 31 december 2010 by independent professional valuers, c.p.robertson-dunn for kenya and h & r consultancy limited in
tanzania. valuations were made on the basis of earnings for existing use.
the book values of the properties were adjusted to the revaluations and the resultant surplus net of deferred income tax was credited to
the revaluation surplus in shareholders’ equity.
capital work in progress is mainly in relation to capital projects being undertaken with respect to kenyan and tanzanian lodges.

a summary of the segment level goodwill allocation is presented in note 5.
the recoverable amount of an operating segment is determined based on value-in-use calculations. these calculations use cash flow
projections based on financial projections approved by management covering a five-year period. cash flows beyond the five-year period
are extrapolated using estimated growth rates. the growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the respective
businesses in which the operating segments operate.
key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations:
                                                                                        kenya             tanzania            zanzibar

notes to the financial statements (continued)
30 contingent liabilities
at 31 december 2014, tourism promotion services (kenya) limited had given guarantees amounting to shs 7,800,000 (2013: shs
7,320,000) to banks on behalf of third parties for supply of goods and services.
tourism promotion services (kenya) limited is a defendant in various legal actions and claims made by third parties. in the opinion of the
directors, after taking appropriate legal and other advice, no material liabilities are expected to crystallise from these claims. consequently
no provision has been set against the claims in the books of accounts.
there are some open tax issues with tax authorities in respect of a subsidiary and an associate. the view of directors is that no additional
liabilities will arise from these matter.
