message from the director
for over 50 years, pnnl has advanced the frontiers of science and
addressed some of the most challenging problems in energy, the
environment and national security. powered by the creativity and
innovation of nearly 4,300 exceptional scientists, engineers and support professionals, pnnl provides
international leadership in deepening our understanding of climate science, inventing the future power
grid, preventing nuclear proliferation and speeding environmental remediation.
pnnl’s leadership requires not only creativity and innovation, but also an unwavering commitment to
our stakeholders – our sponsors, our employees and our community. by striving for excellence in envi-
ronmental, social and economic performance, we aim to meet their needs while positioning the lab
for long-term sustainability. our annual sustainability report provides an integrated view of triple-bot-
tom-line performance and focuses on topics that are material to our stakeholders and our operations.
we have ambitious long-term environmental goals to reduce water and energy consumption. invest-
ments in water efficiency continued to drive down our potable water use, exceeding our goals. our
greatest challenge lies in reducing building energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions, as fulfilling
our research mission drives us to expand into new laboratory- and computing- intensive facilities. to
offset these impacts, we are committed to building facilities that meet the guiding principles for
high-performance sustainable buildings, and to using our facilities as a living laboratory to explore
issues that affect not only our campus but also are challenges throughout doe.
we also leverage our science to create a more sustainable world by training the problem-solvers of the
future. through nearly 1,000 interns, fellows and research associates that we hosted in fy2014 and the
stem education programs we support, we have been fostering the next generation of scientists and
engineers as well as developing a stem-literate community for decades. the local stem high school
spearheaded by battelle, delta, has graduated two classes, secured funding for a new facility and
out-performed others on state assessments. these efforts haven’t gone unnoticed, as the washington
office of the superintendent of public instruction recognized battelle for its thought leadership in
stem education.
our economic performance in fy2014 was strong overall, and with an operating budget of just over $1
billion, our business practices represent a significant opportunity for impact. among our accomplishments,
we exceeded our goals to support small and socio-economically disadvantaged businesses with our pro-
curement spending.
we have the human capital, research facilities and expertise to enhance global sustainability through
our efforts to advance clean energy production, and energy efficient buildings, transportation and infra-
structure. we believe that our commitment to sustainable operations and the investment we make in our
staff, facilities and capabilities position pnnl and the surrounding community for long-term prosperity.

pnnl overview
located in richland, washington, pacific northwest national laboratory is one of 17 u.s. department
of energy national laboratories and one of ten overseen by doe’s office of science. interdisciplinary
teams at pnnl address many of america’s most pressing issues in energy, the environment, and
national security through advances in basic and applied science. in addition to work for doe, pnnl
conducts research for other government agencies including the u.s. department of defense and the
national institutes of health, as well as private industry. at the end of fy2014, pnnl employed 4,308
people and had a budget of over $1 billion. pnnl has been managed for doe by ohio-based battelle
since the laboratory’s inception in 1965.


about this report
this is pnnl’s sixth sustainability
report and was prepared “in accor-
dance” with the comprehensive
option of the global reporting ini-
tiative’s (gri) g4 guidelines. the
gri is a globally recognized sustain-
ability reporting framework that
enables organizations of all types to
assess and share their triple-bottom-
line performance in a similar way.
the g4 guidelines require that sus-
tainability reports reflect the organi-
zation’s significant economic,
environmental and social impacts,
and the topics that substantively
influence assessments and decisions
of its stakeholders.
this pdf summary report and con-
tent on our website pertain to
pnnl’s 12 sustainability focus areas,
associated goals, and performance
against those goals during fy2014.
this information is summarized in
the honeycomb graphic to the right,
and in the sustainability perfor-
mance scorecard (p. 3). the website
includes examples of actions pnnl
takes to drive toward sustainable
operations and actions employees
are empowered to take as well. the

sible through the 2014 gri report

                   in an effort to align gri reporting boundaries with those established by the department of energy for the pnnl campus.

                   1. beginning in 2014, pnnl began reducing scope 2 ghg emissions by the quantity of ghgs avoided from purchasing renewable
                      energy certificates to be consistent with federal ghg reporting guidelines.
                   2. reported per 200,000 employee hours worked.
                   3. philanthropic investments are distributed by a committee of employees from battelle’s pacific northwest division.
                      at least 50 percent of giving is directed to stem education.
