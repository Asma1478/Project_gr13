       the group has established the new mid-term management plan suzuki next 100 - strengthening of its
     management base toward the 100th anniversary of foundation and the next 100 years -, a five-year plan
     from 2015. the fiscal year marked the second year of the new mid-term management plan. the company
     is making steady progress for achieving the 2019 fiscal year goals of 3,700 billion yen and maintaining an
     operating income margin of 7%.
       also, due to changes in the environment surrounding automobiles and to increasingly severe market
     competition, it has become necessary to focus on r&d for environmental performance and safety, and on
     growth investment with a focus on india. amidst such conditions, the company is addressing the following
     issues in order to achieve the new mid-term management plan.

       <compliance>
       in response to the discovery of improper activities that were inconsistent with national regulations
     with regards to fuel consumption and gas emission testing of the company’s automobiles, the company
     immediately implemented measures which included strengthening the legal education and compliance
     training, clarifying the responsibility of certification duties, strengthening internal check systems, etc. the
     entire company shall continue to work to strengthen compliance.

        <quality>
        the company will make the customers’ safety and security its top priority, develop and produce high-quality
     products which the customers can use securely, and provide after services. in the future, while accurately
     ascertaining the quality needs of customers, the company will maintain a high level of quality awareness in
     all departments and will continue to make the utmost effort to ensure the safety and security of customers.

       <products and r&d>
       today, all corporations are expected to consider the environment. in the automotive industry, there is the
     need for environmental technology, low fuel consumption technology, etc. the environment surrounding
     automobiles continues to change. in addition to safety technology, it is now necessary to implement it, etc.
     the group will continue to provide products which are required by customers and which can be used safely
     and securely.

       <production>
       domestically, the group shall work to obtain personnel necessary for achieving production plans. globally,
     while strengthening education, installation of safety facilities, etc. necessary for achieving “safety first”
     factories, the group shall work to improve product quality and to construct an optimal global production
     system.

       <automobile business>
       in the domestic automobile market, the company succeeded in selling 100,000 standard and small vehicles
     for the first time ever. in response to strong demand in india, new gujarat plant began operation. furthermore,
     we are planning the constructing of gujarat plant no. 2 and the engine & transmission plant with the aim
     of beginning operation in 2019. in addition to further strengthening the domestic automobile business
     and indian automobile business which are the two pillars of the group, we will strengthen our automobile
     business in regions such as asean, europe, and pakistan. this will enable us to diversify our income sources
     and to carry forward the all grip structure reformation.

       <motorcycle business>
       while focussing on the 150cc and up, backbone, and sport categories, the group will strengthen the
     consistency of the suzuki brand by ranging the series from large engine displacement motorcycles to small
     engine displacement motorcycles. in the fiscal year, the group focussed on reducing fixed expenses and
     reducing costs. new models including the gsx-r1000 and gsx-r150 were released at the end of the year.
     moving forward, in addition to promoting sales of these new models, the group will achieve a profitable
     structure through management reforms.

       <outboard motor business>
       in addition to focussing on strengthening sales in the american market, the group will proceed the
     development of the asian market and make “the ultimate 4-stroke outboard” its new brand slogan and
     aim at creating the world top 4-stroke outboard motors brand.

       in the fiscal year, the company continued to engage in various social service activities for environmental
     conservation in close cooperation with the local community, as well as to promote our solar energy project in
     order to suppress global warming and to support disaster affected areas. in addition, the company is engaged
     in the research promotion and the scholarship assistance through suzuki foundation and suzuki education
     and culture foundation. in the future, the company shall actively address human rights issues which are
     becoming increasingly prevalent internationally, and shall work to address the domestic issue of reforming
     work styles.

       by balancing between investments for growth and strengthening of its management base, the group will

   corporate philosophy
     basic policy for company management
        the group has been placing “develop products of superior value by focussing on the customer” as the first paragraph of
     the mission statement. we will constantly make the best effort to create truly valuable products that satisfy our customers.
        under the slogan “small cars for a big future”, we will work toward manufacture of “small cars” and “environmentally-
     friendly products” which are wanted by our customers. we will also work on lean, efficient and sound management by
     emphasising the “smaller, fewer, lighter, shorter, and neater” concept in all areas.
        our executive officers and employees will strictly adhere to all statutes, social norms, and in-house rules, etc., act fairly
     and with sincerity.


     mission statement
        in 1962, suzuki established the “mission statement” which indicates the
     corporate policy of suzuki. it sets goals to strive for accomplishing corporation’s
     social missions, for the corporate organisation that the one belongs to, and for the
     one’s own self.

   csr policy
     structure for promoting csr

     concerned, issues, policies, and measures concerning csr activities are discussed. along with the management, the
     company as a whole, aims to promote viable csr activities.



     materiality in csr activities

     striving to accomplish “suzuki environmental plan 2015” for environmental conservation activities from 2012 to 2015
     based on “suzuki global environment charter”. we then established “suzuki environmental plan 2020” for continuous
     environmental conservation activities from fy2016 to fy2020 to clearly present the direction and actions of suzuki’s
     business operations in relation to environment.
      we believe that our most importation task is to seriously recognise effects to environment generated from our business
     operations, develop products that carefully consider environment and promote business operations that reduce
     environmental effects. to accomplish this, we will work on “suzuki environmental plan 2020” with “team suzuki” involving
     domestic and overseas affiliates to build the base for 2020, which is the 100th anniversary of foundation, and for the next
     100 years, following the 4 themes listed below.




                                                                      we will promote development of vehicles with the top-class low fuel
                                                                      consumption and next-generation vehicles in order to reduce co₂ emission,
                                                                      which is regarded as the cause for global warming.
                                                                      in addition, for business operations, we will thoroughly conduct energy-saving

      suzuki is promoting introduction of “environmental management systems” including iso14001 as part of environmental
     conservation activities by its domestic plants and the group’s domestic manufacturing companies.
      the iso14001 is an international standard of environmental management system. by obtaining the iso14001 certificate,
     suzuki intends to follow the relevant regulations and reduce the environmental impact substances. also, through periodical
     environmental audits, we verify the effectiveness of our environmental management system.

     introduction situation in domestic plants and group companies
      all domestic plants already acquired the iso14001 certificate before march 2003. as for the group’s manufacturing
     companies, three manufacturing plants (a plant of suzuki autoparts toyama mfg co., ltd., suzuki autoparts akita mfg
     co., ltd. and suzuki auto parts mfg co., ltd.) and two plants of snic co., ltd. have been certified (as of 1 april 2016). we
     are also promoting to have two uncertified plants (hamakita trim plant and sagara plant) of snic co., ltd. to acquire
     certification. we plan to promote environmental preservation activities throughout the suzuki group as a whole by
     promoting to have non-manufacturing departments such as engineering department to acquire iso14001.

     ●environmental audit
      at suzuki’s domestic plants and the group manufacturing companies, an external audit is conducted once every year by
     an external auditing agent. in addition, an internal audit is conducted to double-check our environmental management
     system.

     external audit
      auditing of documents and on-site auditing are carried out by third party organisation in regard to the validity and
     adequacy of our environmental management system, to determine whether or not measures are being properly
     implemented. auditing results are corrected and countermeasures are put into place for continuous improvement, and they
     are shared among domestic plants and group manufacturing companies to enhance environmental management level.


     internal audit
      for internal audits, two kinds of audits are conducted: one is an overall                                  improvement process through internal audit
     audit, and the other is a local audit. we select auditors that have no direct

     environmental management is being properly carried out or not. all
     auditing results are addressed for continuous improvement.                                                           request for improvement of

     measures for domestic sales distributors
      in order to roll out actions concerning environment in business operations to group companies, we introduced the suzuki
     environmental management system from april 2017 to affiliate automobile sales distributors in japan. this environmental
     management system unique to suzuki is part of our initiative in reducing environmental load (energy consumption and
     amount of wastes) and complying with environmental laws/regulations through pdca recycling. sales distributor that
     introduced this system is progressively promoting the activity centreing on the designated environment manager and
     office.



     emergency training
      we look for locations and operations that have potential of causing an environmental accident* and hold emergency drills
     with employees and other related suppliers at domestic plants and die plants.
     * “environmental accident” refers to accidents that may affect environment such as leakage of chemicals.

     environmental accidents, etc.
      there was no administrative guidance or payment of penalty due to the accidents and complaints in fy2016. there were
     13 environmental accidents and five complaints that were reported to the administration, which were appropriately taken
     care of.
      we will make efforts in preventing accidents through check, improvement, and update of environment-related facilities.

   control of global warming
     we will promote development of vehicles with the top-class low fuel consumption and next-generation vehicles in order to
     reduce co₂ emission, which is regarded as the cause for global warming. in addition, we will thoroughly conduct energy-
     saving in production and distribution, and promote efficient business operations.




     efforts for climate change
      problems with global environment are the big theme for sustainable development of human, and suzuki believes that
     we must cope with these problems as a global enterprise. in particular, we must work on global warming as an important
     theme.


     suzuki’s responsibilities and efforts for global warming
      discussions on global warming have been promoted
     internationally and the international rule to reduce the use of
     fossil fuel that causes co₂ emissions, “paris agreement” was
     established.
      in addition, the suzuki global environment charter
     determines “environmental concept” as “in order to hand over
     the beautiful earth and affluent society to next generations,
     we must all realise that the actions of each and every one of
     us have a great effect on our earth’s future, so we must make
     every effort to preserve our environment.”
      suzuki has an important task that we must be always aware
     of that we manufacture products using fossil fuel and emit
     co₂ also during our business operations, and have to make
     efforts to reduce co₂ emissions.

                                                                                       changes in sales mix in japan

     disclosure of ghg emissions occurred in the entire value chain
      suzuki believes that for reducing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions released through the overall business activities including
     procurement of materials/parts, manufacturing of vehicles and sale of final products, it is important to know and disclose the
     amount of emission from those activities. therefore, we have been making efforts to quantify the emissions of greenhouse
     gases not only resulting from major business activities, but also from a wider scope of the value chain*1 since fy2013.
      the amount of co₂ emissions generated through the entire value chain during fy2016 stood at 72.59 million tons, of which
     the emissions falling under scope 3 (other indirect emissions than those classified into scope 2)*1 were 71.47 million tons that
     include 61.49 million tons of co₂ emissions classified into “category 11 (use of products sold by suzuki)”*2 accounting for as
     much as 84.7% of the total emissions through the overall value chain.                       breakdown of fy2016 ghg emissions

     development of engine
     ●newly developed a 1.0l direct-injection turbo engine that realises both fuel efficiency and power
      the displacement is as small as 1.0l, but direct-injection and turbo charger realise
     high output and high torque equivalent to 1.6l naturally aspirated (na) engine. in
     addition, rigidity is improved as increase in output, and excellent silence is realised by
     taking the countermeasures for vibration and noise in a 3-cylinder engine, this engine
     is easily operable and shows excellent performance in a wide variety of scenes from
     driving in cities to high-speed driving.

     ●direct-injection technologies
      we adopt the direct-injection engine that directly injects fuel to the cylinders. fuel
     consumption is regulated by optimally controlling the quantity of fuel injection,
     timing and fuel pressure, and ensuring effective combustion. in addition, cooling
     effects realised by injecting fuel directly into cylinders improve the anti-knocking
     performance.

             adoption of 6-hole side injection and variable fuel pressure control
      in order to further stringently and constantly control fuel injection, we adopt
     the side injection type for which multi-hole injectors having 6 injection holes are
     arranged in a row.
      in addition, high atomisation of spray is promoted by raising fuel pressure with the                             image of direct-injection in cylinder
     high-pressure fuel pump. the optimum air-fuel mixture is formed and combustion
     efficiency is improved.


     ●waste gate valve normal open control
      we adopt the waste gate valve normal open control for control of turbo charging pressure. the valve is opened during
     constant-speed traveling and closed during acceleration or high-speed traveling to adjust the inflow of exhaust gas. turbo
     charging pressure is finely controlled to realise both power performance and fuel efficiency.




     ●countermeasures for vibration and noise
      vibration and noise prevention performance is sufficiently secured by optimising the flywheel inertia and crank shaft
     balancer weight and improving rigidity of the cylinder block, crank shaft, etc.




                                                                          ●    24 ●

     improvement of transmission
     ●improvement in fuel efficiency through adoption of cvt (continuously variable transmission) with an auxiliary
      gearbox, and its expanded adoption
      cvt with an auxiliary gearbox, which covers a wide range of transmission gear ratio, was first adopted on the palette
     launched in september 2009, and is now installed on all of suzuki’s mini passenger vehicles and compact passenger
     vehicles of 1.0l to 1.6l classes.
      cvt friction was reduced by employing low viscosity cvt fluid and using a ball bearing for the cvt differential side bearing
     since november 2011. then, since the new alto launched in december 2014, we used an allowance of driving force
     generated by weight reduction of the vehicle to heighten the final drive ratio and improved fuel efficiency.


     ●expanded adoption of auto gear shift (ags) for domestic minivehicles
      since it was first adopted on celerio launched in india in february 2014, the auto gear shift has been widely adopted in
     domestic minivehicles, such as carry, alto, every, alto turbo rs and alto works step by step. auto gear shift has both the
     convenience of automatic transmission and the fun of operating manual transmission, and has the same basic mechanism
     as the lightweight and high efficiency manual transmission. plus, it incorporates a computer-aided gear change system
     for optimum operational control thereby ensuring higher levels of fuel efficiency than conventional automatic or manual
     transmissions.




     development of eco-cool, an air-conditioning system
      suzuki developed an air-conditioning system with freezable substance “eco-cool”, which is designed to satisfy both
     comfort and fuel efficiency requirements by freezing the substance with the cold air emitted from the air-conditioner
     during running, and blowing the cool air through the frozen substance with a fan during idle-stop. this system has been
     installed in wagonr, spacia, hustler, alto, alto lapin, swift, solio, and ignis.
                                                                                       operation image of eco-cool

     weight reduction by adopting new platform heartect
      suzuki adopts new platforms one after another.
      the rigidity for the current underbody is ensured by using reinforcement materials for each section. however, the new
     underbody is designed to be a smooth shape that receives and disperses input from the outside, avoiding corners where
     forces are concentrated as much as possible. this design reduces reinforcement materials and realises weight reduction.
      the rigidity of the body is improved with smaller quantity of materials, as well as the steel sheet thickness itself is
     reduced by making the optimum shape.

     weight reduction by adopting ultra high tensile steel sheet
      we frequently use ultra high-tensile steel sheet to sections related
     to deformation upon collision in order to satisfy the target collision
     performance, while uisng thinner sheet with reduced weight.
      we achieved “light weight index” of which smaller value means that the
     body is highly rigid and lightweight of 3.03 (improved by 13% compared to
     the previous swift).

     weight reduction of engine
      compared to k12b type engine, k12c type dualjet engine is made compact by
     reducing the tilt angle from 15° to 5°. in addition, weight is reduced by approximately 4%
     by employing the intake manifold structured with integrated egr pipe and changing the
     shapes of the crank shaft and cylinder block.




     ●use of tailored blanks
      tailored blank is a manufacturing method by which steel parts having different thicknesses or materials (high-tensile steel
     plate, plated steel sheet, etc.) are welded in advance with laser welding, etc., and then pressed. by applying this method to
     various panel components, it is possible to partially reinforce specific portions of the same component, without adding any
     part, thus avoiding weight increase.

     ●extensive use of high-tensile steel plate
      by adopting high-tensile steel plate with excellent strength, the number of reinforcement parts and the entire weight
     are reduced, and the body strength is enhanced. we started using super high-tensile steel plate with ts* of 980mpa for
     wagonr from its third generation model launched in september 2003, and also adopted a higher tensile type (ts of 1180-
     mpa class) to the floor side member of the spacia launched in march 2013. for the wagonr launched in february 2017, we
     expanded the use of super high-tensile steel plate and realised further weight saving, while ensuring the same or greater
     level of collision energy absorption capability than the previous model.

     lightweight index, evidence of high rigidity and lightweight body, is 4.16

     reduction of air resistance
      swift realised excellent aerodynamic performance while paying
     attention to design that has the image of compact and brisk
     driving. computer simulation was fully utilised from the design
     phase, and a wind tunnel test was thoroughly conducted using
     a clay model or prototype vehicle in pursuing aerodynamic
     performance. in particular, ideal wind flow is made by smoothly
     flowing the stream from the front to the rear, and suppressing
     the wind flow in the rear. in addition, we optimised the shape
     of the strake that prevents wind against tires and of the engine
     under cover to rectify the entire air flow under the floor. this
     reduced air resistance and improved fuel efficiency.




     installation of eco-drive supporting devices
     ●installing fuel efficiency indicator
      suzuki has been increasing the number of
     vehicles equipped with eco-drive supporting
     devices, such as a fuel efficiency indicator.
     in fy2016, such devices were installed in 13
     out of 16 types of vehicles

     ●adoption of status information lamp, etc.
      in fy2016, the eco-drive indicator or eco-drive assisting light or status information lamp has been incorporated in 10
     types of vehicles. when the accelerator movement indicates proper driving state for fuel economy, the eco-drive indicator
     located in the meter panel lights up and stays on or the light on the meter turns from blue to green. the driver can
     recognise eco-driving at a glance and fuel efficiency can be improved.

     in addition, the average score for one driving is shown when the
     ignition is off.

     adopting roller rocker
      the cylinder head adopts roller type rocker arms that minimise friction loss.


     optimising piston rings
      thin, low tension piston rings were adopted to reduce friction.


     optimising cylinder processing
      the honing pattern used for the cylinder barrels maintains lubrication for the
      pistons in a manner that helps minimise any loss of performance due to friction.


     optimising oil pump
      optimisation of the oil pump reduces friction loss and contributes to an increase
      in engine output and improvement in fuel economy.


     adopting projected spark plugs
      adopting the use of projected tip spark plugs speeds up the rate of combustion.
      this improves response, especially when the throttle is not open far, and also
      improves fuel economy.

     greenhouse gas emissions from business operations
      “paris agreement” which is the new international framework for reducing greenhouse gas and regulating global warming
     was enforced, and governments and companies are globally promoting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas in order to
     suppress the rise of global average temperature to “less than 2°c”.
        suzuki has been making efforts to reduce co₂ emissions at our locations in japan (plants, experiment facilities, offices,
     etc.) according to “suzuki environmental plan 2015” in order to reduce greenhouse gas that we generate through our
     business operations.
      global emissions of greenhouse gas including our subsidiaries in fy2016 was 560,000t-co₂ for direct emissions (scope 1),
     560,000t-co₂ for indirect emissions (scope 2), and 1,120,000t-co₂ in total. when classifying the emissions to those from
     plant and from locations other than plants (experiment facilities, offices, sales dealers, etc.), the emission from the plant
     was 88.8% (fy2016) of the total emission. in addition, the ratio of the emissions overseas is 54.2% (fy2016) of the whole.
      therefore, suzuki recognises that it is important to globally promote reduction of co₂ emissions at plants in order to
     reduce greenhouse gas in “suzuki environmental plan 2020”, and will continue improvement activities.

    ［production, distribution］reduction of co₂ emission for manufacturing activity

     co₂ emissions amount per global production units
      the target of reduction of co₂ emissions used to be reduction of the total emissions from domestic offices by 15%
     in fy2015 regarding fy2005 as the base year (achieved the target with 16.9% reduction as the result). however, since
     fy2016, regarding the global production volume (converted to the number of automobiles) of domestic and oversesas
     suzuki group manufacutirng companies as the denominator of basic unit and fy2010 as the base year, we determined to
     reduce the co₂ emission basic unit by 10% by fy2020 as our target.
      the total emission of energy-derived co₂ from suzuki and its domestic group manufacturing companies was up by 5.6%
     from the previous fiscal year to 397,000 tons in fy2016, and the total emission of energy-derived co₂ from overseas group
     manufacturing companies was up by 8.6% from the previous fiscal year to 595,000 tons in fy2016. the total co₂ emission
     per global production units (converted to the number of automobiles) was up by 2.6% from the previous fiscal year and
     down by 1.3% compared to fy2010, to 0.311 ton per unit.
      in india, where public electric service is not so good, almost all power used in the plant needs to be supplied through in-
     house power generation, and about 70% of co₂ emissions come from the power generation equipment. however, efforts
     are made to reduce co₂ emissions by using natural gas which generates less co₂ for power generation and by adopting
     solar energy generation and combined cycle power generation that can generate electricity from the vapor coming from
     the exhaust gas emitted from the power generation equipment.

     energy-saving activities at plant
      large energy-saving effects were acquired by remodeling various processes according to production volume, such as
     consolidation of assembly plants of kosai plant (from 3 plants to 2 plants), reduction of machine downtime rate per
     operation in the cast process and machining process, and reduction of steam sending pressure (from 0.58mpa to 0.56
     mpa).
      also, when upgrading the deteriorated production equipment or introducing new equipment for production of new
     models, we promote to build a more effective energy-saving plant by utilising gravity, downsizing and reducing weight of
     equipment, and adopting high-efficient devices such as led light and top-runner devices (motors, transformers).
      besides energy-saving countermeasures requiring equipment investments, all workers perform steady activities such as
     reducing air leakage and turning off the light during break time.
     *“reduction of air leakage” is an activity to reduce leakage of compressed air from hose etc. used in the plant by appropriate maintenance etc.

    ［production, distribution］reduction of co₂ emission from non-manufacturing activity

     energy saving efforts at data center
      at suzuki’s data center, the following efforts and activities have been implemented to reduce the yearly increasing power
     consumption.


     ●integration of servers
      previously, individual departments procured servers respectively. as a result, a lot of similar servers exist in the data
     center. in fy2015, procurement of servers by individual departments was stopped, and all arrangements are now done by
     the global it. a large server called “integrated server” is installed and segmented with the use of “virtual technique”, and
     necessary server functions are distributed according to the requests from individual departments.
      at the same time, the existing servers are being integrated into the integrated server step by step.
      we will conduct this measure continuously.

                            base            the “integrated server” has been installed and used according to the
                                            individual purposes as an application server, file server, or data base server.




     ●transition to ups* shared by data center
      we found that small ups’s were installed in individual racks although a large common ups was installed in the data
     center, and this wastes electricity. so, we are trying to reduce power consumption by removing all of small ups’s from the
     racks and completely transferring the functions to the ups shared in the center.
     *ups: uninterruptible power supply



     ●adoption of task-ambient air conditioning
      recently, densification and high integration is promoted for servers. in particular, we can see this clearly in servers
     related to engineering. therefore, suzuki strive to save energy by installing the task-type air conditioning system for a
     high temperature generating element such as the cae* server and combining it with the conventional package-type air
     conditioning system installed near the wall.
     *cae: computer aided engineering



     ●other efforts
      we are trying to make more efficient energy-saving measures by actively adopting the energy-saving diagnosis by a local
     government or professional vendor to clarify problems.
      we also examine to introduce the automatic air-conditioning control system for the data center.




                                                                             ●   37 ●

      we determined the standard of employee behaviour in fy2008, and all of our employees are getting together to promote
     energy saving at offices and reduction of co₂ emissions. in addition, we put the progress of each activity in relation to
     the standard of employee behaviour on the in-house homepage so that individual employee can check the result of their
     activities.

     ●standard of employee behaviour
      we have established a standard of employee behaviour (for in-house cost cutting activities), which covers a wide range
     of activities, for the purpose of promoting energy saving and co₂ reduction by individual employees.
                                     [standard of behaviour for in-house cost cutting activities (excerpt)]
           ①follow the predetermined temperature settings of air                  ④implement eco-drive.

           ③save electricity of electric appliances.



     ●visualisation of energy consumption specified in the standard of employee behaviour
      to allow individual employees to check the effect of energy saving activities, we put the changes in electric consumption
     at each of major offices and plant buildings, consumption of printing paper, and energy consumption specified in the
     standard of behaviour on our in-house homepage.


     ●introduction of energy saving facilities
     we are promoting introduction of led lighting since fy2012 to
     promote energy saving at offices.
     we changed up to approximately 77% of the light in offices to led in fy2016.

    ［production, distribution］co₂ reduction in domestic transportation

     enhancement of transportation efficiency by reviewing transportation route and packing style
     ●shortening transportation distance (automobile engines)
      until july 2015, for assembling compact cars at kosai plant, a part of the engines manufactured at sagara plant were
     transported approximately 80km to kosai plant. from august 2015, assembling of compact cars was moved to sagara
     plant. by doing so, manufacturing of engines and assembling of compact cars are both conducted at sagara plant, thus
     shortening transportation distance.

                until july 2015                                                     from august 2015

     ●enhancement of transportation efficiency (motorcycle)
      for efficient product transportation from production plants to dealers, distribution bases have been centralised in a
     large consuming region. also, for transportation from the distribution bases to dealers, cooperative transport with other
     companies is conducted to increase transportation efficiency.


     ●enhancing fuel efficiency of tranportation vehicles and
       promoting modal shift
      for domestic transportation of automobiles, suzuki
     uses two types of transportation methods: by land using
     trucks and by sea using ships. for land transportation,
     we are working on improving average fuel consumption
     by promoting eco-drive at consigned transportation
     companies and switching to new vehicles. approximately
     one third of completed automobiles for the domestic
     market are currently transported by sea. we will continue
     to review ways of distribution as needed and promote
     improving transportation efficiency such as by modal
     shift.


     ●co₂ reduction in domestic transportation
      we are trying to reduce transportation                               trends in co₂ emissions from domestic transportation

     for exhaust-gas purification. we optimise the design of                                     section, and platinum (pt) which is
     precious metal and rare earth used for catalysts, and                                       effective in purification of nitrogen
     concentrate precious metal effective for the performance                                    oxides generated during high-speed

     such zone-coated catalyst is adopted for strict emission
     control regulations in japan, europe, etc. in addition,
     we also adopt a thin-wall, high-cell-density catalyst
     excellent for purification of cold engines, and hexagonal
     cell catalyst that performs excellent purification during
     high-speed driving, etc. in order to clean exhaust gas all
     over the world.

     reducing voc (volatile organic compounds)*1 in car interior
      in order to further improve interior environment, we will continue to
     make efforts to reduce the amount of voc by reviewing the materials,
     bonding agents, painting methods for interior parts, etc. for all new
     domestic automobile models sold since january 2006, we have
     successfully achieved lower cabin voc levels than the target set by
     the ministry of health, labour and welfare, which is deemed as the
     automobile industry’s voluntary goal*2. in fy2016, we achieved the
     target for the new wagonr and swift.
      in addition to reduction of voc that has concentration guideline, we
     are making efforts in producing more comfortable cabin environment for
     customers by setting goals for cabin odour and trying to minimise the odour.

     reducing exhaust gas
      we are working on reinforcement of purifying
     performance as exhasut gas reduction technology to
     meet the 2016 exhaust gas restriction in japan.

     improvement in catalyst (tandem honeycomb)
      tandem honeycom was adopted for the v-strom
     650 launched in may 2017. purifying performance is
     reinforced by changing from the coventional single
     honeycomb to a tandem honeycom structure, in which
     two honeycombs are positioned inline with space in rear
     between the two honeycombs.                        honeycomb

     preventing the leakage of sewage
      for the purpose of water quality management and maintenance, our analysis
     department periodically conducts analysis on plant effluent, groundwater,
     water used in factory processes, and industrial water to check the possibility
     of sewage leaking from any plant. if any abnormality should be found in the
     water quality, the relevant section will be immediately informed, and proper
     measures will be systematically carried out.
      we were registered as the “environmental measurement certification
     business (concentration)” of the measurement act in fy1994. since then,
     we have continued to conduct field measurements and verify the measured
     industrial wastewater/wastes, while promoting the group-wide activities for
     prevention of contaminant outflow.

                                                                                                                                                          analysis

     soil and groundwater protection
     ●efforts for prevention of the proliferation of soil contamination
      we are making efforts in purifying and removing contamination appropriately when soil contamination is found. in
     fy2016, we conducted soil survey 5 times in plants in japan, and no soil contamination was found. in addition, our group
     manufacturing companies in japan investigated geography and history in order to record the information about risks
     of soil contamination due to chemical substances etc. used in the past, and are completed at all 16 plants and group
     manufacturing companies.

     ●efforts for cleanup of groundwater
      since the organic chlorine compounds (trichloroethylene and cis-1, 2-dichloroethylen) were discovered in the
     groundwater at takatsuka plant in january of 1999, we have continued the groundwater cleanup efforts and have
     conducted measurements along the plant’s site boundaries. in addition, we started a biological remediation in march
     2015 for groundwater cleanup by using microorganisms to complete the sanitisation as early as possible. groundwater
     is being cleaned up owing to the effect of this bio-remediation. we will aim to complete the cleanup of organic chlorine
     compounds by continuing the bio-remediation.

     reducing noise
     ●vehicle exterior noise
      we are trying to reduce noise generated from automobiles in order to solve road traffic noise which is one of
     environmental problems. as for concrete actions, we are reducing various kinds of noises from the noise source in
     an automobile such as the engine, transmission, air-intake and exhaust systems, and tyres. at the same time, we are
     optimising the design of the sound insulation cover that is used to prevent the inside noises from being released to the
     outside of vehicle.
      we are taking actions for the vehicle exterior noise regulations in japan and other countries on all automobiles
     manufactured and sold by suzuki.
      the company also meets the new exterior noise restriction (r51-03) introduced in october 2016 in japan for all of our
     new models.

     reduction of odour and noise
      although we strictly follow the relevant regulations or laws, the odour and
     noise released from our plants may make local residents uncomfortable.
     compliance with the laws and regulations is the minimum required csr
     (corporate social responsibility). aiming to be fully trusted by the local
     community, we will continuously promote necessary measures for prevention
     of noise and odour and elimination of the potential sources of them.

     purchasing new substances
      before our domestic plants adopt new materials of paints, oil, detergents, etc., the environmental management section
     examines the toxicity of chemical substances contained in the materials and the planned amount of use, as well as how to
     use and store them, and determines whether they are allowed to be used or not. the data collected through the research
     are managed as the pollutant release and transfer register (prtr) data, which will be used for reducing the volume of
     those materials. also, for raw materials, our sds* is kept up-to-date to provide the latest chemical data.

   promoting the 3rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle)
     we will promote business operations considering 3rs when disposing of end-of-life vehicles (elv), as well as in the
     development/design and production phases.
     we will contribute to realisation of sustainable recycling-oriented society by carefully using resources throughout the
     process.



     consideration to recycling

       automobiles

     continuation of design aimed for reducing materials
        among 3rs, the first priority should be “reducing (emission reduction)”. under the policy of making parts smaller,
     fewer, lighter, shorter, and neater, suzuki is promoting reduction of emission by thoroughly reducing materials to be used
     and weight saving.
      for example, the front and rear bumpers and radiator grille of swift launched in january 2017 have been slimmed.


                                                                                thinning of radiator grille

     expanding adoption of thermoplastic resin parts
     ●recyclable design
        recyclable vehicle design is an important factor to allow for easy recycling of end-of-life cars.
      suzuki always tries to produce eco-friendly vehicles by employing easy-to-recycle materials for exterior and interior resin
     parts.

       *1 thermoset resin
          this is a resin material that will not be softened or melted after being hardened by heat and pressure even when reheated.
       *2 thermoplastic resin
          this type of resin material can be softened or melted by reheating even after being formed, and will be solidified by cooling. it is reusable
          through repetitive melting and solidifying.

     recyclable design
      recyclable design is an important factor to allow for easy recycling of                  major components using recyclable resinous
     end-of-life outboard motor. suzuki always tries to produce eco-friendly                       parts (example: df150ap exterior)
     outboard motors by employing easily recyclable materials for covers and
     other components and increasing the use of easily-disassembled tapping
     screws.

     promotion of voluntary recycling efforts
     ●efforts for recycling of bumpers
      in an effort to use resources more effectively, we have been collecting and recycling used bumpers that have been
     removed from automobiles by distributors at the time of repair or replacement.
      initially, used bumpers were collected from distributors in the original form. since 2000, however, they have been
     collected after being shredded by a shredding machine, which has been installed in almost all of our distributors (with
     some exception). additional bumper shredding machine were introduced or added in fy2012.
      as a result, the cubic volume of the (shredded) bumpers for transportation was reduced to 1/6 of the previous volume,
     allowing for reduction of co₂ emission during transportation due to efficient transfer and handling of the downsized
     materials.
      the collected bumpers are recycled and reused to produce such automotive parts as side deck insulator cover, fuel filler
     hose cover, battery holder, engine undercover, foot rest, etc.

     recycling of batteries
     ●collection and recycling of used lithium-ion batteries in japan
      lithium-ion batteries are employed by the low fuel consumption technologies of ene-charge, s-ene charge, mild hybrid,
     and hybrid which are introduced in wagonr, spacia, alto, hustler, solio, swift, etc. suzuki has established and is operating
     a system to collect and properly dispose of the used lithium-ion batteries when disposing of those vehicles at the end of
     their lives.
      for more details of collection and recycling of the used lithium-ion battery, access the following website.
      (only in japanese language)
      http://www.suzuki.co.jp/about/csr/recycle/battery/index.html


     ●collecting and recycling of used lithium-ion batteries in europe
      we launched the baleno equipped with shvs mild hybrid system installed with the lithium-ion battery in europe in april
     2016, and subsequently launched the ignis and the swift. mainly by local importers (distributors), we are trying to build the
     network for collecting used lithium-ion batteries according to the eu “directives for used batteries (2006/66/ec)” and local
     laws/regulations.


     rebuilt parts (reused parts) for repair*
      for effective use of natural resources and reduction of customers’ economic burden, suzuki deals in rebuilt parts for
     automatic transmission (including cvt).
     * rebuilt parts are the aftermarket parts that are removed and collected at the time of repair, reproduced with the damaged or worn portions replaced,
        and finally inspected.

     promotion of recycling abroad
      in the european union, according to the end-of-life vehicle directive (elv directive: 2000/53/ec), which came into effect
     in 2000, automobile manufacturers and importers are required to establish a proper system for collecting and disposing
     of disused automobiles (elvs). suzuki is now organising the worldwide elv collection networks that are designed to be
     suitable for internal conditions of individual countries, with local importers (dealers) taking a leading role.
      in addition, we are obliged to provide disposal companies with the dismantling information on new model automobiles,
     and we give such information through the international information system idis (international dismantling information
     system) jointly organised with other automobile manufacturers.
      moreover, in accordance with the rrr (reusability, recyclability, and recoverability) directive 2005/64/ec, it is required
     that new vehicles shall be reusable and/or recoverable to a minimum of 95% by weight as a condition for receiving
     the type approval of motor vehicles in the european union. to satisfy that condition, we were audited by an authorised
     auditing agency on our systems for collecting material data and verifying environmental impact substances. as a result,
     we acquired the certificate of conformance (cocom) in august 2008 and the whole vehicle type approval based on the
     rrr directive for all of our vehicles sold in europe. then, due to the revision of european rrr directive (2009/1/ec), we
     were audited again by another authorised organisation and obtained a new cocom in october 2013, which was updated in
     october 2013 and october 2015, and our new models have received the type approval based on the revised directive.

     reduction of packaging materials
     ●use of returnable containers <reduction in weight of packaging materials such as corrugated cardboard used for
     shipment of spare parts>
      we are pursuing the use of returnable containers in our domestic shipping of spare parts. in fy2016, returnable containers
     were used in 24% of the whole shipping, which reduced approximately 120t of corrugated cardboard.

     ●promotion of using returnable containers for packaging materials
        <reduction in weight of disposal packaging material used for shipment of kd components>
      we are promoting the use of returnable rack for shipment of kd components. in fy2016, approximately 61% of the total
     deliveries were transported with returnable racks, reducing 3,938t of disposable steel materials.
      for fy2017, we will actively introduce the use of returnable racks in unused destinations with the target of 80% of the
     whole shipment.
      we are also promoting to make resin trays returnable. in fy2016, we newly used these returnable resin trays for cylinder
     blocks and cylinder heads, which reduced 8.9t of disposable corrugated cardboard.


     ●reuse of disposal materials                                             reuse of disposal mirror mat
      in order to prevent damages to spare
     parts during transportation, we reuse
     disposal material produced in plants to
     make cushioning materials. we reused
     approximately 1.8t of disposal mirror mat in
     fy2016.

     ●reduction of landfill amount
      the amounts of landfill of wastes from suzuki plants and group manufacturing companies plants in japan are 0t, both of
     which consecutively indicate the zero level*1. the global quantity of landfill*2 (including japan) was 61t (down 17.6% from
     the previous year). also, in maruti suzuki india, wastewater treatment sludge and other wastes from the plants used to
     be kept at a managed landfill within the company’s premises according to the india’s waste disposal law. but from 2010,
     as a result of making efforts in making sludge and other wastes into cement materials, landfill keeping ended with 324t
     of landfill as the final waste in fy2013. zero landfill has been continued since fy2014, and wastes kept from the past are
     gradually sent to cement company. as for domestic group manufacturing companies, as a result of promoting recycling
     such as making into cement materials, we were able to make landfill amount to 0t, with landfill of 0.04t in fy2015 as the
     final amount.
     *1 definition of the zero level
        plants and die plant in japan: the total amount of landfill is less than 1% of the amount in 1990 (24,675t).
        group manufacturing plants in japan: the total amount of landfill is less than 1% of the amount in 2002 (1,370t).
     *2 data of major overseas plants is provided for fy2013 and later.

     early disposal plan of pcb (polychlorinated biphenyl)
      the act on special measures concerning promotion of proper treatment of pcb wastes requires appropriately disposing of
     pcb wastes contained in old capacitors etc. by 31 march 2027.
      in order to completely dispose of pcb wastes now stored in house as soon as possible, suzuki has made a waste disposal
     consignment contract with a waste disposer authorised by the ministry of the environment. at suzuki’s domestic plants,
     pcb wastes equivalent to 527 units of vehicles have been disposed by the end of march 2017.


     reduction of wastes from offices
      under the policy of making parts smaller, fewer, lighter, shorter, and neater, suzuki is making efforts for paper reduction
     and material recycling.


     ●paper reduction
      for the purpose of reducing the amount of paper used, suzuki has been aggressively conducting company-wide paperless
     and paper reduction activities by promoting computerisation of various documentary forms, duplex printing, use of backing
     paper, and reduction of documents used at meetings.

     ●promotion of material recycling of paper waste
      at suzuki head office, paper wastes were previously burnt for thermal recycling (reused as heat energy). since july 2005,
     however, material recycling has been conducted, instead of the thermal recycling, through separate collection of office
     documents, newspapers and magazines, cardboard boxes, etc. in fy2016, 900 tons of paper wastes were recycled.

     thorough water-saving at offices and employee dormitories
      in order to aggressively reduce water usage, we are making efforts in awareness of water-saving such as by announcing
     detailed measures, in addition to posting water-saving awareness posters in toilets and kitchens. we are also making
     efforts in reducing water usage such as by automating faucets and introducing water-saving models in toilets.

   reinforcement of environmental management
     we will globally establish the environmental control system and improve it continuously in order to promote actions
     concerning environment in business operations in the entire suzuki group. we, as a member of the society, will develop the
     society harmonised with natural environment by promoting environmental communications with various stakeholders.




     reinforcement of environmental management

     management of substances of concern
      based on the imds (international material data system) we introduced in 2003, which is an automobile industry-related
     material data collection system, we have established an in-house management system concerning substances of concern
     (see the chart below). this system enables us to control not only the four heavy-metal substances (lead, mercury,
     hexavalent chromium, and cadmium) targeted by european elv directive, but also substances of very high concern (svhc*)
     specified in the reach regulation (registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals). also, recyclability
     for receiving type approval of motor vehicles in the european union is calculated by using this system.
      so far, we have identified compliance with laws and regulations related to substances of concern on all products
     produced by domestic plants and magyar suzuki (hungary), some products
     of maruti suzuki india ltd. and suzuki motor (thailand) co., ltd., and some
     motorcycles of p.t. suzuki indomobile motor (indonesia) by using this system.
     through such efforts, we verified the compliance with laws and regulations
     related to substances of concern on additional 18 models of automobiles,
     motorcycles, and outboard motors in fy2016.
      we will promote reduction management of substances of concern through
     applying the system for automobiles sold and motorcycles manufactured in
     india.
     *svhc: substance of very high concern

     strengthening thorough prohibition of use of asbestos in suzuki group
      the use of asbestos is thoroughly prohibited in the suzuki’s standards, but we established the new “asbestos control
     rules” in order to enhance prohibition of the use of asbestos in all of our production bases in the world. in the system
     based on this new rule, imported products that may contain asbestos (brake pad, gasket, etc.) are not allowed to proceed
     to the development stage and prototype vehicles using those products are not allowed to be imported to japan unless it is
     proved that no asbestos is contained by the asbestos non-inclusion certificate etc.

     conformance to regulations concerning chemical substances in japan and overseas
      we are promoting the shift to materials that do not contain decabromodiphenyl ether (decabde: brominated flame
     retardants) specified as an additional abolition substance in the pops convention and phthalate type plasticiser specified
     as a limited substance in reach (eu) under cooperation with our suppliers.
      in japan, we are also making efforts for the act to prevent mercury contamination on environment and to show chemicals
     (mainly grease, oil, etc.) on labels according to the revision of the industrial safety and health law.




     promotion of establishment of the system to control substances of concerns in overseas bases
      we have established suzuki green procurement guideline and started its operation accordingly at major overseas
     production bases since 2011 in order to promote establishment of the system to manage substances of concerns.

     promotion of green procurement
      we have established “suzuki green procurement guideline” that indicates our policy to purchase eco-friendly parts and
     materials from suppliers who agree to our guideline and submit “suzuki green procurement promotion agreement” to us.
      we partially revised this guideline in october 2013 to phrase the matter related to establishment of the substances of
     concern control system of partner companies, and prepared/added the self-check sheet for substances of concern control
     system. (we are requesting new and existing suppliers to submit check sheets thereafter. more than 50% of suppliers of
     production parts have attained outside certifications including iso14001.)
      also, we are going hand-in-hand with our suppliers to conform to not only existing regulations, such as european elv
     directive and european regulation concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals
     (reach), but also various future environmental laws and regulations.

     expansion of environmental communication

     efforts for biodiversity
      suzuki introduced the environmental brand suzuki green to realise the philosophy of suzuki global environment charter
     and announced the suzuki biodiversity protection guidelines as the environmental policy in the charter.
      suzuki biodiversity protection guidelines will be the guiding principle for us to recognise the possibility of business
     activities etc. giving unavoidable influences to biodiversity, which has provided our life with enormous natural blessings
     (ecosystem service) since the birth of human, as well as for us to try to reduce such influences, and make efforts to
     ensure sustainable usage.
      suzuki has conducted many actions to reduce influences to biodiversity in our business or social contribution activities,
     and participated in japan business & biodiversity partnership*.
      through the release of the guidelines, we aim to raise awareness about the biodiversity throughout the entire suzuki
     group, and to develop a sustainable society that can coexist with the nature, while keeping good relations with our
     customers and the local communities.
     *partnership that wide varieties of companies mainly from the economic world make efforts voluntarily for conservation and sustainable usage of
       biodiversity and share related information in order to accomplish the purpose of the convention of biological diversity

      the marine & power products operations of suzuki always acknowledges that both of our lives and our outboard motor
     business are made up of water, and our employees voluntarily clean rivers, sea, lakes, etc. where outboard motors are
     used.
      such clean-up activities were first held in december 2010 at sanaru lake, and it will be the 7th in this year.
      since the 2nd time, we expanded the clean-up activities to the world as “clean-up the world campaign”, called for our
     overseas dealers and held the campaign 5 times (6 times for cleaning activities at the headquarters) by fy2016.
      at the headquarters, in fy2016, we conducted the clean-up activity at enshu-nada kaihin park/nakatajima seashore
     (minami-ku, hamamatsu city) with 85 participants. in addition, those activities were conducted also at sales bases in
     japan and overseas dealers, and 91 employees of 11 sales bases in japan and 1400 employees of overseas dealers in 23
     countries participated.
      the 6th clean-up the world campaign is also planned from june to october in fy2017, and already implemented at
     12 locations including the headquarters in japan. in other countries, the campaign has been already implemented in 3
     countries and is planned in 17 countries.
      we will develop these activities further and contribute to local communities in all over the world through cleaning in
     waterfront areas.

     participation to the tree planting project at storm surge barrier in coastal zone of hamamatsu city
      on 29 november 2015, members of the suzuki green club
     participated in the storm surge barrier tree planting project in
     coastal zone of hamamatsu city held by shizuoka prefecture
     and hamamatsu city. total of 4 activities were held by fy2016
     with 178 participants, and 630 nursery trees of pine trees,

     forest of suzuki shimokawa proving grounds (hokkaido)
      suzuki proving grounds is located in shimokawa town (kamikawa county) on
     the north of hokkaido, where the forest accounts for about 90% of the total
     land area. in 2003, the shimokawa town acquired the international fsc®* 1
     forest management certificate (fsc®c015134) as the first forestry cooperative
     in hokkaido, and in 2011, it was designated as an environmental future city*2
     featuring effective utilisation of abundant natural resources. now it aims to
     become a “future city with best harmonisation between people and forests”
     (fsc® c015134).
      moreover, a 303-ha forest located in the suzuki shimokawa proving grounds
     was also recognised to satisfy the strict forest stewardship standards according
     to the fsc® certification program, so the area was additionally registered in the
     fsc® forest group certificate for shimokawa town in 2006.
      at the same time, suzuki will continuously promote co-existence and co-
     prosperity with the local society who takes great care of the nature through
     participation of events and sales of agricultural products.

     participation in “corporate forest preservation program” (hokkaido)
      as part of environmental preservation and social action programs, we cooperate in silvicultural environment protection
     by participating in “corporate forest preservation program”, which is conducted under the profit-sharing afforestation
     agreement with the government (forestry agency) for the period from 1996 to 2028.
      for approximately 4.3-ha national forest (containing approximately 3,000 trees) in shimokawa town, we conduct the
     profit-sharing afforestation by entrusting the work to the local forestry cooperative through hokkaido regional forest
     office. also, for many years, we have contributed to preservation of national land through watershed conservation,
     sediment discharge prevention and co₂ absorption and fixation. the shared profits coming from the program will be used
     for further afforestation activities.

     ●education according to managerial hierarchy
      as part of our employee education program, we provide new employees with awareness-raising workshops concerning
     such basic environmental subjects as suzuki's environmental philosophy, policy, issues, and eco-drive concept. also, we
     provide other employees with environmental training according to their job functions. in addition, training is provided
     to management level employees. in our domestic plants and die plants, special educational programs to prevent
     environmental accidents are carried out especially for employees working in environmentally-important processes. also
     various kinds of environment-related educational programs are provided to new employees, management level employees,
     and all factory employees.

     ●education to obtain special qualifications
      we also encourage employees to obtain some environment-related qualifications. the company holds employees with
     such qualifications such as, 154 employees as pollution prevention managers, 37 as energy managers, and 97 as internal
     environment system auditors.




     promotion of eco-driving
     ●eco-drive education for employees
      it was in fy2007 that we started the eco-drive education as part of our environmental education programs. and since
     fy2009, we have held special seminars focussing on eco-drive at the headquarters and each plant/office on an as needed
     basis. so far, 5,312 persons in total participated in the seminar. apart from the education, we always try to replace vehicles
     used for our daily work with more fuel-efficient ones, and as a result, the fuel efficiency of the vehicles for our in-house
     use in fy2016 has been improved by 0.6km/l compared to fy2015.




     participation in light down campaign
      we participated in “co₂ reduction / light down campaign” held by the ministry of environment.
     we participated as a group and turned off the light of light-up facilities all over the country
     together with households that assented to this campaign on 21 june and 7 july 2016 for
     enlightenment of prevention of global warming.

             if the vehicle speed is in a range from about 5km/h to less than 50km/h (for pedestrian, from about 5km/h to less than 30km/h) at the time of its activation, there is
             a high possibility that you can avoid the collision. depending on circumstances and movements of surrounding objects, only a warning may be issued without
             activation of the automatic brake. or, in other situations, both the warning and the automatic brake may be activated at the same time.

            *when the automatic brake function is activated, a strong braking force is applied. so make sure that every passenger properly wears a seat belt beforehand.
            *after the activation of automatic brake function, the vehicle moves forward due to the creep phenomenon. so be sure step on the brake pedal after the activation.

       to p i c s                 suzuki achieves top rating of asv++ rating in jncap preventive safety performance assessment

      suzuki is launching models that achieved top rating of asv++*1 in fy2016 jncap*2 preventive
     safety performance assessment.
      ignis and solio compact cars and spacia and hustler minicars equipped with dual camera brake
     support (dcbs), a stereo camera type collision-mitigating system, as well as swift compact car
     and wagonr minicar equipped with dual sensor brake support (dsbs), a monocular camera and
     infrared laser radar device, have achieved this top rating as vehicles equipped with excellent
     preventive safety technologies.
      the preventive safety performance assessment is an institution in which the japan’s ministry
     of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism and the national agency for automotive safety &
     victims’ aid (nasva) assess and disclose a result of a vehicle’s advanced safety technologies. the
     assessment for fy2016 involves testing of the following four systems: the frontal autonomous emergency braking system
     (aebs) for vehicles, the lane departure warning system (ldws), the system that provides the driver with information
     captured by rear-facing cameras, and the frontal aebs for pedestrians. assessment points are given based on these tests,
     with the highest possible score of 71 points. if a vehicle achieves at least twelve points, advanced safety vehicle + (asv+)
     rating is approved, and asv++ is approved if it achieves at least 46 points.
      in fy2016 about 60% of passenger cars (minivehicles and standard and small vehicles) sold by suzuki were fitted
     with a collision-mitigating brake including one of the above brake supports. suzuki will continue to enhance our safety
     technologies going forward as we work on improving the safety of our vehicles.

     activities on safety and crime-prevention in cooperation with motorcycle industry
      as a member of japan motorcycle promotion & safety association, suzuki sends some instructors to various motorcycle
     safe riding schools and holds safe driving seminars such as "good rider meeting", in cooperation with motorcycle safe
     riding promotion committee. also, we are promoting the “good rider anti-theft registration” activity for registration of
     motorcycles to prevent theft.
      we cooperate for training of trainers and promotion of "motorcycle safe riding trainer training session" and "centralised
     training workshop for special trainers" organised by japan traffic safety association (jtsa) by sending instructors. in
     addition, we are also involved in the annual "national motorcycle safe riding competition" organised by jtsa by sending
     judges and motorcycles for the competition in order to widely enlighten safety for motorcycles.
      on august 19 determined as "the day of motorcycle" according to the way of reading "819 (bike)" in japanese, we hold
     events for appealing enjoyment of riding motorcycles and traffic safety in cooperation with motorcycle industry such as
     japan automobile manufacturers association, inc. (jama).




     suzuki safety school
      since fy2008, we hold suzuki safety school periodically at the motorcycle school area in ryuyo proving ground to teach
     users of suzuki motorcycles how to enjoy riding safely.
      we accept a broad range of participants including beginners, return riders (who didn't ride their motorcycles for a long
     time), and experienced riders (who want to learn new traffic rules).
      we hold this school as a practical event enabling people to learn, with fun, not only such basic techniques as “how to run,
     turn and stop”, but also "hazard anticipation" and "driving on highways". we held this school seven times in fy2016.

   with our business partners
     suzuki intends to make a social contribution under the first paragraph of the mission statement: “develop products of
     superior value by focussing on the customer”. in creating such valuable products, we believe that the procurement section’s
     role is to work in mutual cooperation with our business partners so that both parties may prosper. those business partners
     are selected through an impartial procedure based on quality, cost, deadline delivery, and technical development capabilities.
     and we have an open door policy, which offers the chance of teaming up with suzuki regardless of size or track record.




     sustainable relationships
      in creating trusting relationships with our business partners we aim to establish sustainable relationships. for that
     purpose, we regard the mutual communications as the most important factor, so that we encourage the sharing of ideas
     not only between the top and middle managements, but also between managements and individuals responsible for daily
     business operations.




     global procurement
      we will accelerate global procurement activities by working with worldwide manufacturing bases. previously, procurement
     activities were carried out mainly on individual local bases, but we have shifted to a more global-basis approach to obtain
     the most suitable parts at competitive prices. that benefits not only suzuki, but also our business partners who can stably
     receive orders and accumulate various technologies. by sharing those merits we can build more confident relationships.




     business continuity plan
      in addition to earthquake-proof reinforcing of individual office buildings, we have started compilation of a business
     continuity plan (bcp). we regard the preparation for earthquakes, tsunami and other wide-scale disasters as part of our
     responsibility to customers and local community. we also recognise our responsibility to local communities, our business
     partners and customers for being prepared for large-scale disasters, including earthquakes, and recommend disaster
     measures such as quakeproofing to our partners located in areas that are likely to experience heavy damage. we are also
     prepared to aid our business partners in their recovery if they should fall victim to such disaster.

     efforts for compliance with laws and regulations, respect for human rights and
     environmental conservation
      suzuki is complying with laws and regulations of each country and region (for example, compliance with “act against
     delay in payment of subcontract proceeds, etc. to subcontractors” and business operations according to the five principles
     for procurement in “automotive industry appropriate transaction guidelines” in japan), respect for human rights and
     environmental conservation.
      also we establish suzuki csr guidelines for suppliers and request our business partners to practice efforts for compliance
     with laws and regulations, respect for human rights and environmental conservation.


     ●suzuki csr guidelines for our business partners
      stakeholders including business partners of suzuki are getting multinationalised and
     diversified as our business activities are developed globally. so, we are expected to fulfill
     social responsibilities with due considerations to other cultures and histories, as well as to
     follow legal and social norms of various countries.
      based on such social requests, we complied basic concept and practices of social
     responsibilities that we should accomplish with our business partners as “suzuki csr
     guidelines for suppliers”.
      we kindly request our business partners to understand the purpose and cooperate with us
     to promote csr activities together.

   with our employees
      under the mission statement “develop products of superior value by focussing on the customer”, suzuki takes actions to
     accomplish the mission that our every single employee thinks and acts by themselves and provides customers with products
     that will enrich their life.
      we give the first priority to assurance of stable employment. also, we try to improve work conditions in order to build healthy
     and a better working environment. employees mutually help each other and try to be a person who can contribute to the
     society with the spirit of “team suzuki”, and the management and employees band together and build a refreshing and
     innovative company.
      in addition, we strive to create systems and environments, focussing on the following points, in order to cultivate the

     efforts for safety, health and traffic safety

     safety and health
      suzuki is promoting the safety and health management activities through our basic safety concept.


                                                                basic safety concept
           ●make safety as first priority. (safety first)
             the basis of corporate activities is “human”.
             the first priority must be always given to safety that protects “human”.


           ●all accidents are preventable.
             managers must lead the workplace, having the strong belief “all labour accidents can be prevented”.


           ●safety is everyone's responsibility.
             while the corporate conducts what they should do, every single person must take responsible actions to
             protect themselves.
             let’s make the climate where everyone follows the rules and mutually warns each other in the workplace.

     health management
      starting from april 1995, we require that all employees 40 years and older have medical and dental checkups for early
     detection and rapid cure of illness. as a follow up to health checks, we regularly carry out health education, nutrition
     instruction, etc.
      we also provide the following programs as measurements for stress and mental health problems, which have been on the
     rise in recent years.

       ●conduct “stress check” based on revised industrial safety and health act

       ●in addition to self-care education, conduct line care education for newly-positioned employees.




     traffic safety
      to encourage each and every employee to set an example in their driving that befits that of a member of an automobile
     and motorcycle manufacturer, we have implemented a number of programs like those described below, that are aimed at
     preventing traffic accidents that could occur not only on the job, but also off the job.

     efforts for career advancement

      suzuki feels that setting high goals is an excellent way to grow one’s self and that such trial itself is the dna of suzuki.
     in order to cope with rapid changes in the market environment, every single employee must set higher goals and strive to
     acquire higher technical capabilities. suzuki implements the rich human resource development program that supports such
     individual challenging spirit.

     but voluntarily setting and striving for the goal in terms of accomplishment of the work. our goal challenge system is
     introduced to allow employees to set and achieve higher goals. in this system, employees confer with their supervisors
     every half period and set specific goals to be achieved over the course of six months. through this process, employees
     can clarify their own goals and improve motivation toward them. in addition, their supervisors can appropriately evaluate
     their goal attainment levels and recognise the training points required to further improve their capabilities.
      suzuki’s personnel system places greater emphasis on occupational ability than seniority. intended to develop
     professional human resources who will lead suzuki’s further growth, it is based on an objective and fair personnel
     evaluation system according to types of work, roles, responsibilities and results of individual employees. the performance-
     based personnel system and the goal setting system motivate employees’ intentions to step up each rung of the corporate
     ladder.




     self-assessment system
      this system is to grant employees opportunities to review their work and capabilities once a year, reconfirm their
     own strength and weakness, and lead them to further improvement in capabilities. in addition, they can clarify jobs
     and departments that they want to try as the career plan, and submit it to their supervisors and the human resources
     department. the submitted contents are effectively utilised as the basic data for development and optimal assignment of
     human resources.




     rotation system
      suzuki implements systematic rotations of human resources by preparing the companywide personnel change plan
     in order to improve employees’ knowledge and technical skills and activate our organisations. the goal we set in this
     system is to have all young employees of technical jobs, office jobs and sales jobs experience the transfer to different
     department(s) within 10 years after entering the company.




     international training program
      we have implemented “2-year training rotations” and “6-month (short) expatriate” that send young employees to
     overseas affiliates since 2015 in order to develop global human resources.




     foreign language training program
      in order to improve language skills of employees, we have introduced the system to allow young employees up to 7th
     year at the company to set the target score of toeic and to take a toeic test for free (examination fees are paid by the
     company).
      in addition, we support improvement in language skills by introducing correspondence courses provided by external
     educational organisations, as well as opening in-house language seminars of english, spanish, chinese, thai, indonesian,
     etc. before and after work hours by inviting external teachers to the company. suzuki provides employees who have
     completed such programs with a subsidy for a part of the expenses. 699 employees took the program in fy2016.

     secure and comfortable working environment

      we are pursuing a working environment where employees who bear business activities can maximise their motivations
     and abilities in a mentally and physically fulfilling condition. various assistant systems are employed to help employees
     work actively through positively adaptating to diversifying working environment. also, a comfortable working environment
     will improve employee’s motivation to increase productivity.



     child-care shortening hours system
      we have adopted a system to shorten daily working hours based on self-application by employees who need child-
     care for children in the third grade or younger. in fy2016, 179 employees used this system. the employees applying for
     this system may be exempted from overtime work in principle. also, they can use the dedicated company's parking area,
     allowing them to use cars for easy pick-up of their children.
      this system enabling employees with small children to choose from various working styles creates a working environment
     where employees with motivation and ability can keep working. we are enhancing awareness of child-care support in the
     entire workplace and promoting "employee-friendly working atmosphere" which can support those short-time workers.




     child-care and family-care leave system
      we provide a variety of leave of absence programs including child-care leaves and family-care leave to employees who,
     due to personal reasons such as child-care, nursing care, have difficulty in working even though they have the will and
     ability to work. this system is used by many employees regardless of gender (74 employees used this system in fy2016).
      the child care leave available after the maternity leave till the day before the child becomes 1 year old (the first birthday)
     can be extended for up to 6 months if there is an avoidable reason such as the child cannot enter any nursery schools.
      employees are allowed to take family care leave for up to 365 days in total per subject family member. besides paid
     vacations, we have introduced the family and medical leave system applicable when caring for parents and children since
     april 2015.

     re-employment system
      since july 1991, far earlier than the revision of the law concerning stabilisation of employment of the older persons in
     april 2006, we have adopted a re-employment system for hiring people after the mandatory retirement age of 60 years old.
     this system offers employment to the people who are willing and able to work after retirement age of 60 years old. now,
     they are using their abundant experience and acquired skills in each working place.




     consultation service, etc.
      as a consultation service that specialises in human resources matters and consultations relating to safety, health,
     and mental health, the “human resources and administration consultation service” is open. plus, in addition to the
     consultation service, an “improvement proposal box” is located at worksite cafeterias and offices, allowing every employee
     to easily make a proposal on work improvement or request for consultation.
      we also have “mental consultation room” with psychiatrist and psychotherapist.




     countermeasure for falling birthrate
      in the society with declining birthrate, suzuki actively supports employees who strive to balance the demands of work
     and parenting.
      for example, we introduced the child-care shortening hours system for those who engage in child care (described above)
     and “child support allowance” applicable to children of up to 6 years old in april 2015.
      in addition, because sudden actions may be needed during daily child care, suzuki allows employees to take paid half-day
     off up to 40 times per year.




     employment of people with disabilities
      suzuki strives to create a working environment where people with disabilities can work for long time at their ease. we
     allocate the dedicated person in charge of employment of people with disabilities in the human resources department to
     provide individual consultations periodically and assign a consultant also to each workplace for caring for their problems.


     ●deployment of an affiliate “suzuki support”

     actions to promote participation by women
      suzuki established the action plan related to promotion of participation by women in order to realise the society where
     women can demonstrate their abilities and work successfully more. according to this action plan, we will increase hiring of

     employee relations

      through mutual confidence, we have developed a good relationship with the suzuki labour union, which represents suzuki
     employees. among the labour union’s goals are stable employment and maintaining and improvement of work conditions. in
     order to meet these conditions, stable development of the company is required. when negotiating salaries, bonuses, labour
     hours, etc. as distributions of the results of corporate activities, we do share the same basic vector, which aims to stable
     development of the company while having discussions from different standpoints: the company and labour union.
      the number of the labour union members is 15,987 as of the end of fy2016, and the unionisation rate of full-time
     employees (excluding managers and non-union members defined in the labour agreement) is 100%.



     employee communication
      we arrange frequent labour-management consultations to ensure that employee ideas are reflected in all of our
     departments, such as research and development, design, manufacturing, sales, etc.
      in addition to discussing requirements (salaries, bonuses, labour hours, etc.) we hold monthly discussions that regularly
     cover a wide range of issues such as management policies, production planning, working hours, welfare, safety and health,
     etc., and earnestly exchange ideas on what suzuki and the labour
     union can do to deliver quality products to the customer.
                                                                                                                    frequency
                                                                            central labour-management consultation monthly



     building a stable relationship with the labour union in the suzuki group
      the suzuki group has 136 member companies (manufacturers, non-manufacturers, sales companies) at home and abroad.
     it is our hope that those 136 member companies are individually trusted by the local residents, society, and customers.
      at suzuki, seminars are given to union officials and human resource management personnel of overseas companies
     to make them understand the importance of cooperative relationship and smooth communication between labour
     and management, as well as the need for a fair and equal personnel management system, etc. we also work with the
     labour union to promote global personnel exchanges both domestically and abroad, and we strive to establish a work
     climate which allows our 63,000 employees in 136 companies to enjoy working with a highly creative and stable labour-
     management relationship.


     ●initiatives by maruti suzuki india limited
      for the development of the company through labour-management cooperation, maruti suzuki is working to establish
     healthy labour-management relationship based on discussions with the union. the company is making efforts in
     continuously strengthening mutual labour-management communication, such as by periodically holding meetings between
     the union and the president, plant managers, human resource managers, and other managers. also, the company organises
     various events jointly with unions such as arrangement of plant tour for family members, sports meet, family day and many
     other events where all employees take part.

     corporate in 1920 as a loom manufacturer, we have been devoted
     ourselves to customer-oriented “monozukuri” based on the word “valuable
     products for customers”. our enthusiasm for “monozukuri” does not
     change even today that we manufacture and sell products all over the
     world.
      the suzuki plaza is an exhibition facility opened in april 2009 to introduce
     suzuki's history and manufacturing spirit to the public. visitors can see
     a lot of our products since our foundation including looms, motorcycles,
     and automobiles that had been developed with the times, and the current
     automobile manufacturing process from development to production.

     manufacturing event
      we hold events for children as an opportunity to enhance our relationship with the local community and to have them
     interested in "manufacturing". those events are related to the history and manufacturing spirit of suzuki, allowing children
     to enjoy learning through experiencing in a different way from textbook-oriented study.




                                               various manufacturing events


      the suzuki plaza will continue to hold such events to stimulate children's interest in "manufacturing". we hope that we
     can help children deepen their knowledge of the automobile industry by accepting field trips of many elementary schools.
     and, we will continue to do our best to become the institution that makes local people happy.

           coupled with today's worsening problems with energy, global warming, etc., the need for automobiles that save
          energy and reduce environmental loads is growing. accordingly, the compact car industry is at the stage of further
          progress by satisfying such need of the time. in such situation, we believe that the compact car industry must
          make more efforts to quickly respond to the public need. for that purpose, further development of the related
          mechanical industries and cultivation of engineers are very important. the suzuki foundation was established
          with collaboration from ministry of economy, trade and industry and other various organisations to continuously
          support and finance those mechanical industries related to compact cars for promoting technological
          development and attracting young people to this industry. (the suzuki foundation was established in 1980,
          commemorating the 60th anniversary of suzuki’s founding, with the funds deposited with affiliated companies,

     protecting personal information
        we fully recognise that personal information (information regarding our customers, business partners, shareholders,
     investors, employees, etc.) is a valued asset that we receive from individuals, and it is our obligation under the law and our
     accountability to society, to handle this information properly and with care. in response to this, we establish the “basic
     policy on protection of personal information” and work hard for protection of personal information. details of handling of
     personal information are released on our public website: http://www.suzuki.co.jp/privacy_statement/index.html (in japanese
     language only)
        we establish the in-house rules and revise them as required according to revision of related laws etc. in order to handle
     personal information appropriately. to familiarise our employees with these rules, suzuki provides education through
     employee seminars or enlightenment from the in-house homepage so that all employees thoroughly become aware
     of protection and appropriate handling of personal information. in addition, the “basic policy on protection of personal
     information” is followed also at member companies of the suzuki group to thoroughly ensure protection of personal
     information. we will continuously review and improve the personal information protection system.




     activities on information security
        as described in the section “protecting personal information”, suzuki prepares codes related to protection of personal
     information and those related to information control in order to manage information useful for the company including
     those provided by other companies.
        in addition, we thoroughly ensure appropriate handling of confidential information by prescribing proper handling and
     leakage prevention of confidential information in the suzuki group code of conduct for employees.
        as for information security, we promote improvement in work by introducing the information system and network, and
     determine the concept and rules to build, manage and operate such information system and network in order to prevent
     information leakage and unauthorised access, while improving availability of information.
        servers which may cause severe influence if it stops and those that save data important for security such as personal
     information are installed in the lockable server room with seismic countermeasure taken by seismic isolators etc.
        suzuki organises the confidential information control promotion committee and reinforces the information control
     system of the entire suzuki group.

     disaster measures by suzuki
      suzuki takes various measures for natural disasters including great earthquake along the nankai trough to minimise
     influence of damages, giving top priority to “protecting employees’ lives” and “quickly restoring ourselves for our
     customers”. for example, we have taken various preventive measures such as earthquake-resistant measures for buildings
     and facilities, fire prevention measures, establishment of the disaster action manual and business continuity plan (bcp)
     that include establishment of the disaster response organisation, and purchases of earthquake insurances.



     disaster prevention
      while the group has been taking various measures to prevent anticipated damage caused by great earthquake along
     the nankai trough, after experiencing the great east japan earthquake, it has diversified production and research sites
     including overseas. firstly, it is relocating plants and facilities to miyakoda district in northern part of hamamatsu city from
     ryuyo region in iwata city, shizuoka prefecture since massive tsunami damages are anticipated in the region. the group
     decided to found the test course of the motorcycle in the aoya district of tenryu-ku, hamamatsu city. also, the group has
     diversified its production of engine for minivehicle, which was concentrated to sagara plant, to kosai plant to mitigate
     risk. further, the group is expanding its research facilities in india partly in order to mitigate risk concerning product
     development facility for automobile in sagara test course. the group will continue to enhance its preparedness against
     natural disasters.


     measures against earthquakes and tsunami taken by suzuki for local residents
      a part of suzuki’s facilities is registered as an emergency shelter for local residents when a disaster occurs. we have a
     system for an earthquake to deploy watchmen on the roof of the headquarters, let them check occurrence of tsunami,
     and sound a siren to notify residents when tsunami is found. manual and electric sirens are installed on the roof of the
     headquarters. the electric siren is designed to be operated even with the dedicated electricity generator in case of a
     power failure.


     measures against earthquakes and tsunami taken by suzuki for employees
      aimed to protect the lives of our employees, earthquake early warning systems are installed at the headquarters and
     each plant. earthquake and tsunami evacuation drills are repetitively conducted with all employees participating. in this
     drill, when the earthquake early warning system alerts, the employees secure their safety and the employees at offices
     with risk of tsunami evacuate to safe places where the water of tsunami cannot reach. we have a system to confirm safety
     of employees immediately when a disaster occurs via satellite telephones set at each plant and sales distributors all over
     japan as an emergency communication tool. we conduct a drill for satellite telephones every month to be ready for an
     emergency.
      in addition, relief method trainings are conducted by retired fire fighters in all offices, and repetitive trainings are
     continuously carried out regularly twice a week. this enables our employees to arrest bleeding or treat injuries and convey
     in stretcher on their own upon large-scale disasters.
      furthermore, in order to confirm safety of off-duty employees, we introduce the "safety information system" in case an
     earthquake or tsunami occurs. in order to confirm safety of employees and their family, this system automatically sends
     “safety inquiry e-mail” to e-mail addresses that each employee has registered and those who receive the e-mail send a
     reply about their own safety situation.




                      tsunami evacuation training                                           first-aid training

     measures for fire disasters
      at the headquarters and each plant, all unpredictable fires are treated as fire disaster. regardless of how small the size of
     the fire, we conduct an initiative to find out the real cause of fire and thoroughly carry out effective measures. all cases of
     fire are shared throughout the company in an effort to cross-functionally take measures in preventing familiar disasters. a
     fire drill using fire extinguishers and fire hydrant is conducted at plants so that everyone in a worksite can perform first-aid
     firefighting to minimise damage caused by fire.
      also, water discharge drills by fire engine or small transportable pump are performed for promoting individual disaster
     prevention activities by the private fire brigade. above all, the premises of headquarters, kosai plant, iwata plant, osuka
     plant, and toyokawa plant are certified as cooperative business entities for local fire brigades by hamamatsu city, kosai
     city, iwata city, kakegawa city, and toyokawa city, respectively because of their contribution to reinforcement of local
     fire-fighting and disaster-prevention system etc.




     contribution to construction of storm surge barrier in coastal zone of hamamatsu city
      suzuki contributed 500 million yen by fy2014 to "hamamatsu city tsunami protection measure fund" that hamamatsu
     city founded for constructing the storm surge barrier as a measure for tsunami caused by an earthquake.
      the suzuki suppliers association organised by suzuki's associated companies also decided to contribute 39.06 million
     yen in total for five years.
      the company also contributed 270 million yen in total to neighbouring eight cities and towns for disaster measures such
     as earthquakes and tsunami by fy2016.
      in addition, a total of 500 million yen was contributed to "hamamatsu city sports facility align fund" by fy2014 to
     cooperate with construction of a sports facility which has both tsunami evacuation base and urgent relief heliport
     functions in the accident.

     (note 1) fuel consumption rate is values taken under the specified test conditions. the rates vary according to various conditions such as the actual conditions of
              use (weather, traffic, etc.) by customers, driving situations, vehicle conditions (equipment, specifications, etc.), and maintenance conditions.
     (note 2) the steady state fuel efficiency is the fuel consumption rate based on actual measurement taken when a vehicle runs at the constant speed.
     (note 3) the value in wmtc mode is a value calculated based on the emission gas test results measured in the international standard driving mode
              including starting, acceleration, and stoppage. the driving mode class is categorised according to displacement and maximum speed.

              use (weather, traffic, etc.) by customers, driving situations, vehicle conditions (equipment, specifications, etc.), and maintenance conditions.
     (note 2) the steady state fuel efficiency is the fuel consumption rate based on actual measurement taken when a vehicle runs at the constant speed.
     (note 3) the value in wmtc mode is a value calculated based on the emission gas test results measured in the international standard driving mode
              including starting, acceleration, and stoppage. the driving mode class is categorised according to displacement and maximum speed.
