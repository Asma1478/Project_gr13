csr at hasbro
corporate social responsibility at hasbro is powered by a simple
belief that every day is a chance to be better. the things we love
most about play — joy, creativity and problem solving — inspire us
to make a positive and enduring difference in the world. thinking
and acting responsibly guides us toward smarter ways of doing
business. it unlocks new opportunities to improve how we design,
create, make and market our iconic brands.

our deep commitment to csr reflects our desire to help build a
safer, more sustainable world for future generations. as we grow
our business and our social and environmental challenges evolve,
so do our csr programs and practices. we view csr as a journey of
continuous improvement and our approach is guided by three key
csr priorities that influence the decisions we make every day:

our csr commitments also extend to other important areas including:
maintaining strong governance and ethical conduct, supporting
the well-being of our employees, and marketing our products
responsibly. additionally, hasbro is committed to helping children
in need around the world through our philanthropic efforts to
empower childhood by bringing hope, play and service into the
lives of children worldwide.

performance highlights
hasbro continued to see steady improvement in its
csr program in 2015. we view our social and
environmental advancements as points of departure,
rather than points of arrival, as we challenge ourselves
to be better.


   1     product safety


at hasbro, quality and safety are closely aligned. we incorporate
safety into product design, reinforced by a strict testing protocol. our
rigorous quality assurance process guides our path from product
design and material selection to engineering and manufacturing. we
focus on producing strong safety outcomes. in 2015, we had zero
consumer product recalls and no product safety fines.

more information about hasbro’s product safety program is
available on our csr website.



engaging for chemical safety reform

hasbro government affairs worked collaboratively with
u.s. congress and non-governmental organization (ngo)
partners to encourage development of one uniform
national standard for chemical safety. this led in 2016 to
the passage of the chemical safety improvement act
(csia), which was the first substantial revision to chemical
laws in the u.s. since 1976. the csia is designed to provide
a unified, national approach to chemicals management,
ensuring that products are uniformly safe for children
across all 50 states.

    2 environmental sustainability

environmental sustainability is core to how we manage our business.
we are committed to reducing our environmental footprint in
our operations and supply chain and reducing the impacts of
our products and packaging. in 2015, we continued to advance
our industry leadership in sustainable packaging, formalized our
commitment to climate change and renewable energy use, and
made strides in reducing our operational footprint.

more information about hasbro’s sustainability efforts is available
on our csr website.

 3      human rights and ethical sourcing


hasbro believes that when consumers choose our toys and games, it’s
an act of trust that our products are manufactured safely, under fair labor
conditions and without ethical compromises. we work in partnership
with third-party vendors to identify industry best practices, engage in
strategic partnerships, and regularly monitor our third-party factories
to enhance the safety, well-being and dignity of workers.

achieving compliance by third-party factories is an ongoing process
and requires deep engagement and oversight. as we move toward a
more global sourcing strategy, this is becoming increasingly important
for our business.

in 2015, hasbro continued to pursue high ethical standards in factories
that manufacture hasbro products.

more information about hasbro’s commitment to human rights and
ethical sourcing program is available on our csr website.




strengthening our ethical
sourcing standards

in 2015, hasbro strengthened its global business
ethics principles — our ethical sourcing standards and
requirements for our vendors, suppliers and licensees —
to address modern forms of slavery as well as to
reinforce that freedom of association also includes the
right to collective bargaining.




partnering with vendors to pilot
worker collaboration tool

in 2015, working with key vendors in china, we
partnered to pilot a mobile phone survey tool in four
vendor factories to collect information and further
understand the opinions of workers. while most
factories saw some improvements in worker opinions
on increased job satisfaction, improved worker/
management relationships, and reduced worker stress,
we will continue to partner with our vendors and
explore tools that increase outreach capabilities and
foster workplace improvements in vendor factories.

2015 challenges and
looking to the future
people and the planet are core to our purpose of making the world
a better place for children and their families. this is why we continue
to make csr a business priority and have long been committed to
doing the right thing for our employees, our consumers and the
communities in which we serve.

we believe csr is a journey of continuous improvement — one that
is guided towards points of departure, rather than points of arrival —
full of challenges and key learnings. this ultimately deepens our
understanding of the complex issues of the world in which we operate
and inspires us to raise the bar and strive to be better. as we work
to elevate our csr efforts in the future, we feel it’s important to
reflect on the challenges we faced in 2015 and share how we
are looking to improve in 2016 and beyond.




engaging stakeholders through
a materiality assessment

hasbro began its formal csr practice in 2011 and, at our five
year anniversary, we find it appropriate to both reflect on
our journey and to gather insight on the relative importance
of csr issues, including key environmental, social and
governance topics. in 2016 we will conduct a materiality
assessment and evolve our csr strategy accordingly.



resetting our operational
environment goals

in 2015, hasbro sold its two owned and operated manufac-
turing facilities3 which significantly reduced our operational
footprint and affected our progress in meeting some of our
2020 environmental goals. to address this, we are creating
new goals in 2016 and restating our baseline. one of the
challenges we will face in defining future goals is identifying
significant reduction opportunities given that, since 2002,
we have made considerable improvements in conserving
energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions at our
owned and operated facilities.

ethical sourcing
in 2015, as part of our ethical sourcing program, all our third-party factories located in china
were required to maintain a seal of compliance from the icti care program. the following
chart provides a breakdown of the seal levels4 for the 53 factories in china that account for
approximately 85 percent of hasbro’s toy and game production in 20155. in 2016, hasbro joined
the electronic industry citizenship coalition (eicc) and began transitioning third-party factories
 globally to become audited to eicc standards.
