                                                         in fiscal 2014 we succeeded in posting
                                                         increases in both sales and income, with
                                                         recurring profit reaching 174.2 billion yen.
                                                         and while the year-on-year increase
                                                         in recurring profit over fiscal 2013 was
                                                         attributable to some degree to changes in the

                                                         yen, for example – i believe our growth in profit
                                                         owes greatly to the shift to full production
                                                         at taganito hpal and steady progress in
                                                         implementing our business strategies: cost-
                                                         reduction measures and so on.
                                                              not everything went smoothly, however,
                                                         and as might be expected we still have areas
                                                         where further improvements in terms of
                                                         management are needed. so going forward,
                                                         instead of contenting ourselves with the
                                                         positive results posted in fiscal 2014, we will
                                                         continue to pursue realization of our long-

     pioneering initiatives in the expanding
     market for automotive lithium-ion
     secondary batteries
     lithium-ion secondary batteries have become
     familiar parts of our lives through devices such as
     smartphones and home appliances. within this
     market, rapid expansion is predicted in the area of
     automotive applications. smm is taking a pioneering
     lead in lithium nickel oxide, the positive electrode
     material that holds the key to these automotive
     batteries, and is establishing
     a competitive advantage.

     together with the rapidly expanding ev
     market
     in recent years, demand for electric vehicles (evs)
     has shown marked growth, and the automotive
     lithium-ion secondary battery market is expected to
     grow accordingly.
          one key element in lithium-ion secondary batteries
     is the positive electrode material. major automobile
     manufacturers have so far adopted manganese-
     based positive electrode material for use in their evs,
     but these present issues including short single-charge
     driving range. lithium nickel oxide (nca) has garnered
     attention as the next-generation positive electrode
     material to break through these barriers. u.s.-based
     tesla motors has adopted batteries using nca, and is
     manufacturing and selling evs with a driving range of
     about 500 km.

                        smm’s csr activities are promoted by the csr committee, which convenes at least
                        once a year and comprises the president, as chairman, and the heads of the business
                        and head office. attached to the csr committee are three working groups—
                        the compliance, risk management, and quality assurance working groups—and
                        six subcommittees overseeing the following areas: efficient resource utilization,
                        environmental preservation, corporate citizenship, human rights and human resources
                        development, occupational health and safety, and communication. each of these six
                        subcommittees, which correspond to the smm group’s “six key csr areas,” works
                        toward annual plans and targets in the quest to realize the “vision for 2020.” csr
                        activities consistent with these annual plans and targets are advanced principally
                        through initiatives at business sites and group companies. actual implementation
                        is carried out by all officers and employees according to their individual roles. the
                        csr committee reviews the activities of each area based on reports from working
                        groups and subcommittees. reviews include activity progress reports and activity
                        plans for the next fiscal year, evaluations of the company’s environmental, social, and
                        economic performance, the execution of corrective measures where necessary, and
                        the implementation of our pdca (plan-do-check-act) cycle.

the company’s responsibility
the company is responsible for the preparation of the indicators in accordance with its own reporting criteria (the “company’s reporting criteria”), as described in the report,
which are derived, among others, from the g4 guidelines and environmental reporting guidelines of japan’s ministry of the environment; self-declaring that the report
is prepared in accordance with the criteria stipulated in the g4 guidelines; reporting on the alignment of the company’s policies to the icmm’s 10 sd principles and the
applicable mandatory requirements set out in icmm position statements; reporting on the company’s identification and prioritization of material issues; reporting on the
company’s approach and management of its material issues; and including the material sustainability information defined in the ’sustainability reporting assurance and
registration criteria’ of the japanese association of assurance organizations for sustainability information (“j-sus”) in the report.

our responsibility
our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the indicators based on the procedures we have performed. we conducted our engagement in accordance
with ’international standard on assurance engagements (isae) 3000, assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information’, ’isae 3410,
assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements’, issued by the international auditing and assurance standards board, and the ’practical guidelines for the assurance
of sustainability information’ of j-sus. the limited assurance engagement consisted of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information
presented in the report, and applying analytical and other procedures, and the procedures performed vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance
engagement. the level of assurance provided is thus not as high as that provided by a reasonable assurance engagement. our assurance procedures included:
l interviewing with the company’s responsible personnel to obtain an understanding of its policy for the preparation of the report and reviewing the company’s reporting criteria.
l inquiring about the design of the systems and methods used to collect and process the indicators.
l performing analytical reviews of the indicators.
l examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the generation, aggregation and reporting of the indicators in conformity with the company’s reporting criteria, and also
  recalculating the indicators.
l visiting to the tochigi factory of sumitomo metal mining siporex co., ltd. selected on the basis of a risk analysis.
l evaluating the overall statement in which the indicators are expressed.
l evaluating the company’s self-declaration that the report is prepared in accordance with the g4 guidelines at a core level against the criteria stipulated in the g4
  guidelines.
l assessing the alignment of the company’s policies to the icmm’s 10 sd principles and the applicable mandatory requirements set out in icmm position statements through
  documentation reviews and interviews.
l interviewing with the company’s responsible personnel and reviewing documents with respect to the company’s process of identifying and prioritizing its material issues
  and its approach to and management of its material issues.
l assessment of whether or not all the material sustainability information defined by j-sus is included in the report.

conclusion
based on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that:
l the indicators in the report are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the company’s reporting criteria as described in the report;
l the company’s self-declaration that the report is prepared in accordance with the g4 guidelines at a core level does not conform to the criteria stipulated in the g4 guidelines;
l the company’s policies are not aligned to the icmm’s 10 sd principles and the applicable mandatory requirements set out in icmm position statements as described on page 65;
l the company has not identified and prioritized its material issues as described on pages 2 and 21 to 24;
l the company has not approached and managed its material issues as described on pages 31 to 38; and
l all the material sustainability information defined by j-sus is not included in the report.
