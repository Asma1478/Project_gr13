                               changes made to the 2012 registration document filed with the
                            autorite des marches financiers (amf – the french securities regulator)
                                        on 27 february 2013 under the number d.13-0085



this registration document, prepared on 26 april 2013 under the responsibility of the chairman and chief executive officer, supersedes
the version filed with the french securities regulator (amf) under the number d.13-0085 on 27 february 2013. that version contained an
error in note 15.2 to the consolidated financial statements relating to the financial information on companies accounted for under the
equity method. the error was not identified until after approval of the financial statements by the shareholders’ general meeting on 16
april 2013. contrary to what was shown under contracting and vinci immobilier in the second table of the note in question, net financial
debt of companies accounted for under the equity method was €651.1 million (not €174.7 million) in 2012. with the exception of this cla-
rification, which has been added as a footnote, no other change has been made to the registration document.



below is the table as it now appears on page 229 of the 2012 registration document available on vinci’s website at www.vinci.com

    operators receive six weeks of
    classroom instruction provided
    by local training organisations,
    followed by four weeks of
    practical training focused
    mainly on equipment
    operation, which includes
    70 hours of practice on a
    several-hectare site specially
    developed at each training hub
    to simulate worksite condi-
    tions. during practice, trainees
    are supervised by a profes-
    sional instructor and a mentor
    from one of the consortium
    companies. beyond preparing
    employees to work on this
    project, the extensive training
    effort will have a lasting impact
    on the regions.

                     message from the chairman and ceo

                                vinci enjoyed another vigorous year in 2012. our growth strategy
                                passed an important milestone at the end of the year with the plan to
                                acquire the portuguese airports previously managed by the state,
                                including the lisbon hub. we expect to close the deal sometime in the
                                middle of 2013. vinci airports thus now emerges as a front-rank
                                international player in a market stimulated by constant growth in air
                                traffic. the move also represents another major step forward in the
                                group’s expanding concessions business, seven years after becoming
                                europe’s number one motorway operator with the formation of vinci
                                autoroutes.
                                   key figures for 2012 once again show how sturdy our model is, with
                                revenue up 4.5%, and a slight increase in operating income and net
                                income despite tough business conditions, in europe especially.
                                   in france, the pace of work is quickening on the sea tours–bordeaux
                                high-speed rail link, and is set to reach full speed in 2013, confirming our
                                group’s outstanding capacity to harness its resources and extract
                                synergies from all its business lines. on our motorways, we illustrated our
                                role as an investor serving the public interest via the hundreds of
                                environmental projects making up the green motorway package and by
                                completing the a89 near lyon. meanwhile, the operational synergies
                                between our different motorway networks allowed us to go on improving
                                profitability even though traffic growth was flat.
                                   in our contracting business, our companies held up well overall in
                                france and the rest of europe, even though economic conditions were
                                tougher than in 2011. they expanded in markets outside europe thanks
                                to a combination of dynamic local networks and significant new
                                contracts for major projects.
                                   while expanding in concessions and pursuing our strategy of
                                balancing growth between our two main businesses, we have continued
                                to make acquisitions in the contracting business. the takeover of

                                                     strategy and outlook

combining growth
and resilience
the key to vinci’s strategy is the three-way
fit between its concessions business and its
contracting business (the latter comprising
energy, roads and construction), in terms of:
– operating cycles: long in concessions, and
short to medium term in contracting;
– financial considerations: concessions are
capital intensive and generate recurring
revenues, whereas contracting requires
relatively little capital but is structurally cash
positive;
– mutually reinforcing expertise: programme
organisation and financing, and project
management during construction and
operation in concessions; and the capacity to
design, build and maintain complex
structures in contracting.
    this strategic model has served vinci well
since its inception, underpinning its
expansion in times of economic growth and
providing resilience in a cyclical downturn.
    vinci’s managerial culture combines
decentralisation and autonomy for its
operating subsidiaries with empowerment
for its managers and a networked approach
to operations. these underlying principles
encourage individuals and groups to
perform to their best, while making vinci
companies exceptionally responsive to
market conditions.
    in today’s uncertain economic climate,
vinci’s first priority is to consolidate the         01
fundamentals underpinning its strategic
model. its deployment across a broad array of
business activities and a growing number of
markets and regions is making it sturdier
than ever. moreover, the medium-term
visibility afforded by the contracting
business’s order book allows these business
lines to adjust swiftly to cyclical shifts.
in turn, this responsiveness allows the group
to anticipate market developments.
rigorously applied principles now hard-wired
into the group’s managerial reflexes
– starting with selective order-taking, tight
control of overheads and a ceaseless quest
for productivity gains – will preserve the                                                     construction; of etf (rail sector works) and

                                    in january 2013, the last section of the a89 motorway leading
                                    in to the lyon urban area was inaugurated. this transversal
                                    artery on which construction began in 1990 puts lyon just five
                                    hours and 15 minutes from bordeaux and establishes a link
                                    between areas determined to develop their potential, such as
                                    le roannais.

                                    the a89 has established a direct motorway link between
                                    bordeaux, clermont ferrand and lyon. what are the benefits it
                                    brings to an area like le roannais?
                                    roanne flourished in the first half of the 20th century because of its location as
                                    a double hub, on the n7 express road link and the paris–lyon–mediterranean
                                    rail line. in the 1960-1980 period, the routing of the a6 motorway and then
                                    the tgv high-speed rail line through mâcon weakened its position. during
                                    this period, the city also had to undertake an industrial reconversion against
                                    the backdrop of crisis in the textile and mechanical engineering sectors, and
                                    the phenomenon of globalisation. roanne has now found a new balance
                                    for its activities, which have been diversified and strengthened. the over-
                                    concentration on industry has been corrected by the arrival of service activities
                                    and roanne companies have gained in value-added by focusing on the top end
                                    of their markets. but the problem of accessibility remained. to legitimately
                                    claim its position as the western gateway to the lyon urban area, roanne
                                    needed an effective transport link. the a89 motorway gives it just that, with a
                                    magnificent, fluid and reliable road layout.

                                    what immediate and medium-term impacts is the new road
                                    link expected to have on the area’s economic fabric?
                                    companies in the area will be more easily able to attract executives, which
                                    will help consolidate its service-sector reconversion. our universities will also
                                    benefit from better mobility and the road layout has revealed the charm of
                                    our landscapes. tourist activity – coupled with our gastronomic tradition – is
                                    bound to take advantage of the new situation. for the lyon area, the a89 opens
                                    up opportunities to the west that it struggled to exploit given inadequate
                                    infrastructure. it will help the establishment of decentralised entities in the
                                    roannais area’s attractive land base.

                                    the a89 is often described as the “consultation” motorway.
                                    would you agree with this?
                                    the term strikes me as absolutely justified. first, there was close consultation
                                    between political decision-makers, the chamber of commerce network and
                                    companies in the area. in le roannais, all the stakeholders, including environ-
                                    mental protection non-profits, believed that the motorway would be a genuine
                                    asset if well designed and built. secondly, asf played a major role by doing
                                    the work required to really bring the area together and take all its aspects into
                                    account so that all the parties would adhere to the project.

     vinci park and buzzcar have joined forces to promote
     sustainable car use. the innovative community platform
     buzzcar, launched initially in lille and tourcoing and
     currently being extended to other large cities in france,
     brings car owners and drivers together around a simple,
     secure car-rental service between private individuals.
     you advise committees set up to promote innovation and tech-
     nologies in a number of big cities around the globe on the issue
     of transport. what do you think will be the main characteristics
     of the mobility of the future?
     it will be multimodal. most people in the rich countries walk out of their
     homes and immediately climb into a car. however, they are increasingly
     tending to live in urban areas where the car is not always the most effective
     – or the fastest – way of getting around. conversely, it is definitely the most
     expensive: running a car costs around €6,000 a year and this cost is con-
     stantly rising. in future, we will be able to choose our mode of transport
     depending on the nature of the trip: walking, cycling, metro, bus, train and,
     from time to time, the car, which we will pay for only when we use it. in
     addition, the size and characteristics of the vehicle will depend on the
     purpose of the trip: a one- or six-seater, a van or scooter.

     over 10 years ago, you founded zipcar, a pioneering car-
     sharing service company, in the united states. what is the
     connection between it and the buzzcar service in france?
     with zipcar, car-sharing is organised around rental of vehicles belonging to a
     fleet. when we created this service, customers often asked us: “why can’t
     i have the convenience of a car near my home, in my neighbourhood, in my
     city?” it was an economic problem: we couldn’t guarantee a large enough
     return on investment per vehicle to be able to offer this service everywhere.
     with buzzcar, individual car owners rent out their own car, so we’re capitalis-
     ing on the excess capacity of cars belonging to other people. a private car is
     unused 95% of the time on average. if a neighbour rents it once a month, it’s
     a straightforward profit for the owner. car-sharing can be organised every-
     where, in the city or elsewhere. as for choosing france to introduce this
     solution, it reflects the fact that france is ahead of the usa as far as
     multimodal transport is concerned.

     you have joined forces with vinci park to develop buzzcar. why
     did you make this choice?
     vinci park car parks are everywhere – and they’re full of cars just sitting
     there. so it was logical to think of vinci park in connection with a car-rental
     plan. i also liked the fact that vinci park had already begun thinking about
     developing services based on the new mobility solutions that are starting to
     emerge. very few big companies in the automobile sector share my forward-
     looking vision of transport. and lastly, i must admit that i was very impressed
     by the quality of customer reception and service in their car parks!

     how would you sum up efforts to improve the safety of
     french nuclear facilities in the wake of fukushima and the
     aging of the power plants?
     most of our nuclear power plants are approaching the 30-year mark, an
     age at which a number of components must be renovated or replaced
     even when they have undergone regular maintenance. this is what is we
     call a major refit. clearly it would not be prudent to invest in such a large
     operation if it is only to extend the lifespan of the fleet for 10 years, so we
     will be aiming for 20 to 30 years. we have therefore identified – and this
     was done before fukushima – the safety improvements needed at power
     plants when they reach the age of about 40, including the addition of a
     third set of electrical circuits and an additional water supply system.
     these changes will bring us close to a number of safety objectives
     specific to third-generation reactors.
     in light of the lessons learned from fukushima and the recommendations
     of the french nuclear safety authority, these changes will have to be
     brought forward and scheduled by 2018, in parallel with the major refit
     operations to be carried out on a substantial part of the facilities during
     the 2012-2025 period. we are preparing for this work. we cannot do it
     alone, of course. we need the support of a solid industrial fabric and have
     presented a number of projections to all our partners, including the vinci
     group.

     against that backdrop, how are edf’s requirements
     expected to change?
     edf’s technical requirements will remain unchanged. the real challenge
     will be to cope with the retirement of a substantial portion of the
     workforce that built the power plants. we will have to cope with the
     generational transition at a time of intensive work. edf and its partners
     will have an equal need to renew skills and we will all have to work
     together intelligently to meet this challenge. from that point of view,
     vinci energies is an important partner, though its name is less familiar in
     the power plants than the names of such companies as cegelec, tunzini
     and kellal. vinci energies has the capacity to set up and coordinate
     responsive, hands-on teams and to provide the strong support they will
     need if they are to expand at a time when activity is sharply increasing, as
     it will be shortly.

     what role do you think a group like vinci can play in build-
     ing new-generation power plants and decommissioning the
     oldest facilities?
     the set of core competencies in maintenance operations and upgrades
     that vinci is developing for the major refit are the same as the ones that

     the london borough of hounslow awarded a consortium
     comprising vinci concessions and ringway, eurovia’s uk
     subsidiary, the upgrade, repair and maintenance of its
     highways network for a period of 25 years. the consortium
     will invest €125 million in the project.


     what is the aim of this contract? what is special about it?
     our streets are generally in poor condition as we’ve made other investments
     over the last 20 to 30 years. our purpose is to make the streets of hounslow fit
     for the 21st century. it’s a quite complex contract and a long-term investment
     based on a private finance initiative (pfi). our partner, vinci concessions and
     ringway, will be borrowing €125 million, with the majority invested in the first
     five years of the contract. this investment puts the borough in a very strong
     position to be able to improve almost all of the streets in hounslow for the
     benefit of our 250,000 residents. during this core investment period, vinci
     concessions and ringway will be upgrading the entire street infrastructure:
     roads, footpaths, streetlights, signs, trees, and so on. beyond the initial period,
     vinci concessions and ringway will then be maintaining everything for
     another 20 years up to the required standards.

     how can the london borough of hounslow council measure
     these standards?
     under the contract, there are about 300 indicators on which the performance of
     vinci concessions and ringway is judged during 25 years. they concern the whole
     range of services such as the condition of the highways and pavements, condition
     of the street lighting, which has to be brought up to standard, the removal of
     graffiti, the cutting of the grass verges along the streets, and so on. during the first
     five years, there are a number of milestones that vinci concessions and ringway
     will have to achieve, and we are confident that they will meet these standards
     following an exhaustive process to agree the contract.

     what criteria influenced your decision in favour of vinci
     concessions and ringway?
     we went through a very rigorous procurement exercise, choosing vinci
     concessions and ringway as our partner for several reasons. firstly, the quality of
     the bid they made. in particular, they bring their know-how and experience. they
     also bring innovation in terms of use of materials that will greatly improve the
     appearance of our streets. they have also been involved with this local authority
     for a long time, as they have been working on a contract with hounslow for over
     20 years. the council very much liked the quality and the ideas they brought to
     the project. although they are a multinational company, we appreciated their
     understanding both of the kind of service we provide our local communities and
     of what the people want out of a local highways service.

     the millennium challenge corporation, a us government
     agency, funds poverty reduction programmes in low- and
     middle-income countries engaged in a process of sustai-
     nable economic development. in 2006, mcc signed a
     $307 million compact with benin. some of the funds went
     towards financing the rehabilitation of the port of cotonou,
     a project in which a consortium of vinci companies took
     part.

     what sets the mcc model apart? what, for example, are the
     main criteria used in the selection process?
     mcc encourages candidate countries to carry out reforms to strengthen
     governance, economic freedom and investment in human capital. it uses a
     selection process based on performance, as measured by some 20 indicators,
     and identifies priorities and projects to be carried out by the recipient
     countries themselves, which are responsible for implementation. eligible
     countries must continue the reform process, which is assessed annually, and
     maintain or improve their overall performance as measured by the mcc-de-
     fined indicators.

     what criteria did the benin millennium challenge account
     apply in the selection of the vinci consortium to carry out
     the port of cotonou extension project?
     the tender documents included environmental, employment, and occupatio-
     nal health and safety clauses. the bid submitted by sogea-satom and its
     partners, judged technically sound with the best financial conditions, met
     these requirements. the work was carried out without a single serious
     accident. the environmental clauses were also complied with. for example,
     for the extension of the sand trap, about 375,000 tonnes of rock were safely
     transported in compliance with local regulations over a distance of 150 km.
     this involved about 12,000 truck round trips and 20 trainloads. since the
     structure was handed over six and a half months ahead of schedule,
     mca-benin asked the vinci consortium to carry out other works in the port
     of cotonou (zoning, rail line, car park, lighting, etc.).

     benin is eligible for a second mcc programme, for which you
     are currently developing the content. under what conditions
     will this new compact be signed? what kinds of companies
     do you think best suited to support you in implementing this
     second contract?
     the award will depend on the close-out of the first programme, the conti-
     nued success of the projects already completed and the way in which the
     eligibility criteria are met. to implement the second programme, companies
     should have a profile corresponding to the projects selected between now
     and the end of 2013. obviously their expertise, reliability, professionalism
     and experience will be major factors in the selection process.

              vinci turned in a robust performance in 2012, with further growth in revenue and net income despite a difficult economic climate, particularly
              in europe.

              this achievement reflects the soundness of the group’s fundamentals: the complementary nature and resilience of its two core businesses
              (concessions and contracting), growth focusing on high value-added activities outside france and prudent financial management.
              vinci’s consolidated revenue rose 4.5% to €38.6 billion. this represents 1.5% organic growth, a 0.8% positive currency effect and 2.3% growth
              from acquisitions. the main acquisitions, made by contracting entities, were outside france. in 2012, 37% of total revenue was generated
              outside france (42% in contracting).

              cash flow from operations before tax and financing costs (ebitda) amounted to €5.4 billion (+1%) and equal to 14.0% of revenue. vinci autoroutes’
              ebitda margin improved slightly, from 69.5% in 2012 (69.4% in 2011).

              operating income from ordinary activities (ebit) was €3.7 billion, up 0.3% and representing 9.5% of revenue, compared with 9.9% in 2011. in
              contracting, the ebit margin was 4.2%, against 4.6% in 2011. the decline is attributable mainly to non-recurring items at eurovia and vinci
              construction.

              operating income, which reflects the impact of ifrs 2 share-based payment expense, impairment charges and the group’s share of income
              or loss from companies accounted for under the equity method, was €3.7 billion (+1.4% compared with 2011).
              net income attributable to owners of the parent was €1,197 million, representing 0.7% growth compared with 2011. earnings per share
              increased 1.6% to €3.54, partly due to the group’s purchases of its own shares during 2012.

              net financial debt was €12.5 billion at 31 december 2012, slightly down relative to end-december 2011. operating cash flow amounted to
              €3.1 billion in 2012 and covered all investments by vinci autoroutes (€1.1 billion), 2012 acquisitions(€0.7 billion) and dividends paid
              (€1.1 billion).

              vinci’s credit ratings were confirmed by standard & poor’s (bbb+) and moody’s (baa1), both with stable outlook.

              the group obtained excellent terms for several bond issues and placements totalling more than €1.5 billion, at an average interest rate of
              3.66%, to refinance its debt in advance. vinci continued to benefit from good access to credit and was able to renew for five years a bank
              credit facility granted to asf for €1.8 billion.

              at 31 december 2012, the group’s liquidity was very high at €11.5 billion. it comprises €5.0 billion net cash managed and €6.5 billion medium-
              term bank credit facilities maturing in 2016 and 2017.

              contracting maintained its good business momentum throughout 2012, especially outside france. at 31 december 2012, its order book stood
              at €31.3 billion (up more than 2% relative to end-2011), of which 45% is outside france. the international order book is up 12% over 12 months.

1.1.2   financing operations
        new corporate financing
        as part of its €3 billion emtn programme, vinci sa carried out several bond issues and placements in the first half of 2012 to refinance its
        debt:
        ˇˇ january 2012:

        ˇˇ in june, july and september, asf carried out three private placements – for 11, 12 and 10 years, respectively – amounting to €170 million
        in total as part of its emtn programme.
        ˇˇ in june 2012, cfe issued €100 million of six-year bonds with a coupon of 4.75%.


        debt repayments
        in january 2012, vinci made an early repayment of €750 million to reimburse the remainder of the loan taken out in 2006 to finance the
        acquisition of asf.
        in late june 2012, asf holding repaid a €1,080 million syndicated loan arranged in december 2006 and due to expire in the fourth quarter of
        2013.
        in october, asf repaid €406 million of loans from the cna (caisse nationale des autoroutes).

        after these transactions, the average maturity of the group’s financial debt was 6.1 years at 31 december 2012.

        renewal of asf’s medium-term bank credit facility
        in july, asf agreed a five-year €1.8 billion syndicated credit facility with a consortium of banks, replacing the previous €2 billion facility due to
        expire in december 2013.

        long-term financing granted for infrastructure projects under concession or public-private partnerships
        in 2012, vinci signed long-term project financing agreements, without recourse to shareholders, totalling around €350 million. they concerned
        mainly pfi (private finance initiative) contracts for road maintenance in hounslow (£88 million, 24.5 years) and the isle of wight (£95 million,
        up to 24.5 years) in the uk, and the dunkerque arena (€69 million, 27 years and eight months) in france.


1.2     revenue
        vinci’s 2012 consolidated revenue amounted to nearly €38.6 billion, up 4.5% compared with 2011. this reflects organic growth of 1.5% and
        a 0.8% positive exchange rate effect, along with 2.3% from the acquisitions made by eurovia (napc in india and carmacks in canada) and
        vinci energies (ga gruppe in germany) in 2012, and by soletanche freyssinet in turkey and the uk at the end of 2011.

        concessions revenue rose 1.1% (0.9% on a comparable structure basis) to almost €5.4 billion, with a 0.7% increase at vinci autoroutes and
        strong growth at vinci airports.

        contracting revenue (vinci energies, eurovia, vinci construction) was €33.1 billion, up 5.1%, or 1.5% on a comparable structure basis.

        in france, revenue totalled €24.3 billion, an increase of 3.2% (3.0% on a constant structure basis). concessions revenue grew 0.9%, while that
        of contracting increased 3.9%.

        outside france, revenue rose 6.8% to €14.3 billion, although this represents a decrease of 1.1% on a constant structure and exchange rate
        basis. in 2012, 37% of vinci’s total revenue was generated outside france (42% in contracting).

        concessions

        vinci autoroutes (asf, escota, cofiroute and arcour): revenue rose 0.7% to €4,439 million. toll revenue increased 0.6% despite a 1.7% decrease
        in traffic on a stable network (light vehicles down 1.4%; heavy vehicles down 3.5%), but this decline was offset by the ramp-up of the a86
        duplex (+0.2%) and higher toll prices.

        vinci concessions generated revenue of €915 million, up 3.1% (1.8% on a comparable structure basis). vinci airports recorded strong growth
        (18%) due to growing traffic levels at nantes-atlantique airport and those of cambodia airports. vinci park posted slight growth in revenue
        to €615 million (up 2.6% on an actual basis or 1.5% on a comparable structure basis, including 1.3% in france and 2.2% internationally).

        contracting

        vinci energies: €9,017 million (+4.0% actual; +0.9% on a comparable structure basis)
        in france, revenue was €5,486 million (-0.4% actual; stable on a constant structure basis). business levels remained strong in telecommunica-
        tions with the ramp-up of the gsm-r project, and in energy infrastructure, but they were adversely affected by weaker photovoltaic business.
        the industrial sector was resilient in an unfavourable economic environment. however, activity in the tertiary sector was less robust, despite
        firm growth at vinci facilities (+5.6%).

        outside france, revenue totalled €3,531 million (+11.7% actual; +2.7% on a comparable structure basis). the situation varied geographically. in
        europe, business levels fell sharply in spain and portugal, grew slightly in switzerland and germany (on a comparable structure basis), with
        more pronounced growth in belgium, the netherlands and sweden. strong growth was recorded in emerging-market countries such as
        indonesia, morocco and brazil.

        eurovia: €8,747 million (+0.3% actual; -4.5% on a comparable structure basis)
        in france, revenue was €5,159 million, up 1.2% on an actual basis (0.5% on a constant structure basis). roadworks business taking place through
        regional entities was stable, with a fall in volumes of around 4% offset by higher prices for oil products. specialist businesses like demolition,
        industrial activities and rail sector works posted growth of over 9% (almost 5% on a comparable structure basis).

        outside france, revenue totalled €3,588 million, down 1.0% (-11.4% on a comparable structure basis). there was firm growth in the uk, chile,
        the usa and canada. however, central european countries posted significant declines in activity due to the end of major projects (the
        r1 expressway in slovakia and a fall in investment in poland after the euro 2012 football tournament) and a difficult economic environment
        in the czech republic. business levels in germany remained stable.

        vinci construction: €15,327 million (+8.6% actual; +5.5% on a comparable structure basis)
        in france, revenue amounted to €8,410 million, up 8.8% actual or 8.5% on a constant structure basis. this reflects the ramp-up of the tours–
        bordeaux high-speed rail line project, which accounted for revenue of more than €550 million in 2012, along with ongoing steady growth in
        residential and non-residential building activity. french overseas territories posted a good performance.

        outside france, revenue was €6,917 million, up 8.5% (+2.1% on a comparable structure basis). the change on a comparable structure basis
        reflects rapid growth at sogea-satom in africa, which offset the contraction seen by central european subsidiaries. business levels in other
        divisions (benelux and the uk) were stable overall.

        vinci immobilier

        revenue rose 16.2% to €811 million in 2012. this growth was driven by residential property after work began on a significant number of units
        in late 2011, and by several large business property projects.

      in concessions, ebit was €2,159 million, up 0.5% compared with 2011 (€2,149 million). it represented 40.3% of revenue, close to the level
      achieved the previous year (40.6% of revenue).

      at vinci autoroutes, ebit was stable at €2,019 million (€2,018 million in 2011). despite slight growth in revenue in 2012 and firm control over
      operating expenses, ebit margin declined from 45.8% to 45.5% in 2012. this was attributable to an increase in special concession amortisation
      expense following the commissioning of contractual investments, particularly in relation to the green motorway package and road widening
      works carried out on the a63.

      at vinci concessions, ebit was €139 million (€130 million in 2011). ebit margin improved from 14.7% in 2011 to 15.2% in 2012, driven mainly
      by vinci airports’ strong performance.

      contracting posted a 2.2% fall in ebit to €1,403 million (€1,435 million in 2011). as a proportion of revenue, it fell from 4.6% in 2011 to 4.2%
      in 2012.

      at vinci energies, ebit rose 4.0% to €502 million (€483 million in 2011) and ebit margin was 5.6%, the same as in 2011.

      at eurovia, ebit was €277 million, down 14% from €322 million in 2011. as a proportion of revenue, it declined from 3.7% in 2011 to 3.2% in
      2012 due mainly to losses in poland as a result of low business levels following the euro 2012 football tournament and write-downs of work
      in progress.

              change reflects provisions taken at vinci construction grands projets following an unfavourable court decision in the usa.

              ˇˇ share-based payment expense, which reflects the benefits granted to employees under performance share plans, share option plans and
              the group savings scheme. it amounted to €94 million in 2012 (€101 million in 2011).
              ˇˇ goodwill impairment charges, which amounted to €8 million in 2012, the same as in 2011.

              the cost of net financial debt was €638 million, compared with €647 million in 2011.
              the group’s policy of converting fixed rate debt to floating rate enabled it to benefit from lower interest rates and this completely offset the
              fall in returns from investments and the current higher costs of refinancing.
              the average interest rate on long-term financial debt at 31 december 2012 was 3.63%, (3.93% at 31 december 2011).

              other financial income and expense resulted in a net expense of €19 million, compared with net income of €25 million in 2011. for 2012, this
              item includes capitalised borrowing costs on current investments, mainly at asf and escota, in the amount of €71 million, compared with
              €61 million in 2011. it also includes the negative impact of the cost of discounting retirement benefit obligations and provisions for the obliga-
              tion to maintain the condition of concession intangible assets – due to lower interest rates – in the amount of €91 million, compared with
              €47 million in 2011. capital gains on disposals of securities and receivables amounted to €1 million (€3 million in 2011). dividends received
              from unconsolidated entities totalled €17 million in 2012, versus €16 million in 2011.

              income tax expense for the year was €969 million (€984 million in 2011), resulting in an effective tax rate of 33.3% in 2012 (33.6% in 2011).
              this change reflects taxation of some foreign subsidiaries at lower rates.

              non-controlling interests amounted to €109 million (€92 million in 2011) and consisted mainly of the share of cofiroute and cfe income that
              is not attributable to the owners of the parent.


1.5           cash flow from operations
              cash flow from operations before tax and financing costs (ebitda) totalled €5,418 million in 2012, up slightly relative to the €5,366 million

1.6   other cash flows
      the net change in the operating working capital requirement and current provisions resulted in an outflow of €37 million in 2012, compared
      with an inflow of €93 million in 2011. this change is due mainly to an increase in the working capital requirement of eurovia’s activities in
      central europe (completion of major projects in slovakia and poland) and draw downs of project advances in construction.

      interest paid decreased €48 million to €595 million in 2012 (€643 million in 2011). income taxes paid rose €42 million to €979 million
      (€936 million in 2011) due to the increase in tax payments on account required by french subsidiaries and the payment of french dividend tax.

      cash flow from operating activities (*) was €3,865 million, down €73 million compared with 2011 (€3,938 million).

      after accounting for operating investments net of disposals of €742 million, up 11% relative to 2011 (€668 million), operating cash flow (**) was
      €3,123 million, close to that of the previous year (€3,270 million).

      growth investments in concessions and ppps totalled €1,140 million (€1,135 million in 2011). they included €1,046 million invested by vinci
      autoroutes in france under the motorway operators’ master plans and the green motorway package (€1,017 million in 2011). in particular,
      investments made by the asf group remained very high, increasing from €841 million in 2011 to €861 million in 2012, of which almost 30%
      related to completion of construction of the lyon–balbigny section of the a89.

      free cash flow before financial investments amounted to €1,983 million (€2,134 million in 2011), including €841 million generated by
      concessions and €738 million by contracting (€766 million and €1,130 million respectively in 2011).

      financial investments net of disposals, including the net debt of acquired companies, represented €598 million, compared with €172 million
      in 2011. acquisitions included carmacks in canada and napc in india by eurovia, ga gruppe in germany by vinci energies and the increase
      in entrepose contracting’s stake in geostock from 25% to 90%.

      disposals of shares amounted to €7 million in 2012 (€40 million in 2011).

      there was also the buy-out of non-controlling interests in entrepose contracting (€102 million). this transaction is presented under an item
      related to “capital transactions” in the cash flow statement since it did not result in a change of control and is therefore regarded as a transac-
      tion between shareholders.

      dividends paid in 2012 totalled €1,057 million (€1,036 million in 2011). this includes €979 million paid by vinci sa, comprising the final divi-
      dend in respect of 2011 (€653 million), the interim dividend in respect of 2012 paid in november 2012 (€295 million) and the coupon on the
      perpetual subordinated bonds issued in 2006 (€31 million). the remainder comprises dividends paid to minority shareholders by some sub-
      sidiaries, mainly cofiroute.

      capital increases totalled €336 million in 2012, including €275 million relating to group savings plans and €61 million relating to the exercise
      of share options.

      vinci also pursued its share buy-back programme, purchasing 17.7 million shares in the market for a total investment of €647 million, which
      more than offset capital increases.

      as a result of these cash flows, there was a €63 million reduction in net financial debt during the year ended 31 december 2012.

      (*) cash flow from operating activities: cash flow from operations adjusted for changes in operating working capital requirement and current provisions, interest paid, income taxes paid, and divi-
      dends received from companies accounted for under the equity method.
      (**) operating cash flow: cash flow from operating activities adjusted for net investments in operating assets (excluding growth investments in concessions and ppps).

              consolidated non-current assets amounted to €35.4 billion at 31 december 2012 (€34.8 billion at 31 december 2011).
              they consisted for the most part of concession assets (€26.5 billion). after taking account of a working capital surplus of €6.7 billion (attribut-
              able mainly to the contracting business), down €120 million compared with 31 december 2011, consolidated capital employed was €28.7 billion
              at 31 december 2012 (€28.0 billion at the end of 2011).
              the concessions business accounted for 87% of total capital employed (90% at 31 december 2011).

              the group’s equity increased from €13.6 billion at 31 december 2011 to €14.1 billion at 31 december 2012. this figure includes €735 million
              relating to non-controlling interests (€725 million at end-2011).
              the number of shares, excluding treasury shares, was 536,245,294 at 31 december 2012 (540,255,171 at 31 december 2011).

              consolidated net financial debt was €12.5 billion at 31 december 2012 (€12.6 billion at 31 december 2011).
              for the concessions business, including holding companies, net financial debt stood at €18.1 billion, down more than €800 million relative to
              31 december 2011. the contracting business generated a net cash surplus of €2.1 billion in 2012 (€2.9 billion at the end of 2011), the decline
              being due mainly to acquisitions in 2012. the holding companies posted a net financial surplus of €3.5 billion at 31 december 2012, stable
              overall relative to 31 december 2011.
              the ratio of net financial debt to equity was 0.9 at 31 december 2012, in line with the end-2011 figure. the financial debt-to-ebitda ratio stood
              at 2.3, stable compared with that at 31 december 2011.

              the group’s liquidity remained very high at €11.5 billion at 31 december 2012. this comprises €5.0 billion of net cash managed and €6.5 bil-
              lion of unused confirmed credit facilities, including €1.1 billion expiring in 2016 and €5.3 billion expiring in 2017.

2.    parent company financial statements
      vinci’s parent company financial statements show revenue of €11.8 million for 2012, compared with €12.7 million in 2011, consisting mainly
      of services invoiced by the holding company to subsidiaries.

      the parent company’s net income was €256 million in 2012, compared with €2,997 million in 2011. this includes €324 million of dividends
      received from group subsidiaries (€3,006 million in 2011). expenses referred to in article 39.4 of the french general tax code amounted to
      €64,675 in 2012.

      note c.10 to the parent company financial statements contains the disclosures relating to suppliers’ payment terms required by france’s lme
      act on modernising the country’s economy and article l.441-6-1 of the french commercial code.



3.    dividends
      the board of directors has decided to propose to the shareholders’ general meeting on 16 april 2013 that the amount of the dividend for
      2012 be set at €1.77 per share, the same as for 2011.
      taking account of the interim dividend of €0.55 per share paid in november 2012, a final dividend of €1.22 will be paid on 22 may 2013 if
      approved. it will also be proposed that shareholders be given the option of being paid the final dividend in new shares. the ex-date is set at
      23 april 2013.

1.2   vinci selected to acquire ana, the portuguese airport concession company
      on 27 december 2012, vinci concessions was selected by the portuguese government to acquire ana, the company that holds a 50-year
      concession contract for the country’s 10 airports: lisbon, porto, faro and beja on the mainland; ponta delgada, horta, flores and santa maria
      in the azores; and funchal and porto santo in madeira.
      ana constitutes a group of high quality airports that handled 30 million passengers in 2011 and has a large proportion of international busi-
      ness. passenger numbers have increased at an annual average of more than 4% over the past 10 years. the lisbon hub handles a quarter of
      all traffic between europe and brazil, while traffic to portuguese-speaking africa (angola and mozambique) is seeing strong growth. in addition
      to managing airport facilities, ana’s operations include retail activities, ground handling services, and safety and security.

      through the acquisition of ana, vinci concessions subsidiary vinci airports will become a significant international player in airport conces-
      sions, with 23 airports managed in portugal, france and cambodia. these airports handle 40 million passengers a year, including an international
      hub in lisbon with over 15 million passengers. vinci airports should have revenue of around €600 million and ebitda of more than
      €270 million.

      the transaction, which is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2013, will be submitted for prior approval by the european competi-
      tion authorities.

2.            information on trends
2.1           outcome in 2012
              when publishing its quarterly results in october 2012, vinci set its targets as follows:
              “the good activity during the third quarter of 2012 combined with recent external growth transactions should lead to an approximate 4%
              increase in the group’s full-year 2012 top line.
              “in terms of operating and net incomes, despite the margin pressure being felt in some sectors and countries, vinci was targeting levels close
              to those reached in 2011 before taking into account the new tax and social charges being considered in france.
              “ongoing discussions surrounding the proposed 2013 french finance law (le projet de loi de finances 2013) imply that these new charges could
              negatively impact vlncl’s 2012 net income, which could be down by 3% to 4% compared to its 2011 level.”

              vinci exceeded the above targets, particularly following adjustments made to parts of the draft 2013 budget applicable in 2012.


2.2           trends in 2013
              at 31 december 2012, the order book of the contracting business lines (vinci energies, eurovia and vinci construction) stood at €31.3 billion.
              this represents a 2% increase year on year (down 5% in france; up 12% outside france) and equals more than 11 months of average business
              activity. about two-thirds of the orders are to be executed in 2013.

              vinci energies’ order book totalled €6.8 billion at 31 december 2012, up 5% over the year (down 2% in france; up 18% outside france).
              it represented nine months of vinci energies’ average business activity.

              eurovia’s order book amounted to €6.4 billion at 31 december 2012, up almost 10% year on year (down 3% in france; up 22% outside france),
              representing nearly nine months of eurovia’s average business activity.

              vinci construction’s order book at 31 december 2012 totalled €18.1 billion, down 1% since 1 january 2012 (down 6% in france; up 6% outside
              france) and equals more than 14 months of vinci construction’s average business activity.

              on the date of publication of this document, there have been no material changes in the group’s financial and commercial situation since
              31 december 2012, other than those described in note b.1 of this report.



3.            the group’s markets: seasonality of business
              most of the group’s activities, but particularly roadworks, civil engineering and some concessions, record lower business volumes in the first
              half of the year than in the second. this is due mainly to less favourable weather conditions. in 2012, the difference in revenue between the
              two halves was about 13%.

              the seasonality of the group’s business is also reflected in the net use of cash in the first half, which is attributable to the lower level of receipts
              during this period and the pattern of operating cash flows, the majority of which is generated in the second half of the year. group income
              and expenses in respect of ordinary activities that are of a seasonal, cyclical or occasional nature are accounted for using the same accounting
              methods as those adopted for the full-year financial statements. income and expenses invoiced on an annual basis (e.g. patent and licence
              fees) are accounted for on a pro rata basis using an estimate for the full year.

c.      risk factors
        numerous internal and external risk factors may threaten the group’s objectives, as vinci operates in a complex and changing legislative,
        regulatory, geopolitical, economic and financial environment.
        however, in accordance with the group’s subsidiarity principle, vinci’s decentralised organisation aims to assess and handle risks at the most
        appropriate level of responsibility (subsidiary, business line, holding company) depending on their criticality.

        the general guidelines in conjunction with the resultant risk management and internal control systems of the group enable the reporting of
        information to the centre on the main risks and their treatment. under this process, the major group entities prepared a risk mapping in 2009
        and have updated it periodically. this identified the main risk sources and the more significant events that could hinder the achievement of
        the group’s objectives. the consequences of these events are evaluated according to their potential financial, human or reputational impact
        and the associated probability of occurrence. preventive measures to reduce the probability of occurrence of such events and their impact
        have been implemented.

        provisions are taken for likely risks, including in particular possible losses on completion of construction projects as specified in notes 20, 21
        and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

        unfavourable economic developments may lead to a decline in public-sector orders and private-sector investment and limit access to financ-
        ing, subsequently putting pressure on business volumes, prices and the group’s financial situation. the adaptation of the group’s products,
        services and activities to changes in the economic climate constitutes the major challenge vis-à-vis the operational, financial, legal, environ-
        mental and technological risks presented below.



1.      operational risks
1.1     commitments
        commitments connected to bidding or to the acquisition or disposal of businesses constitute the main risk factor faced by vinci companies
        in their various business activities (concessions, energy, roads, construction, property).
        risk identification and assessment are taken into account in cost estimates right from the bidding stage of each project. budgets are then
        prepared and updated during the contract execution phase.

1.1.1   bidding
        the group has set up a selective bidding policy, which involves the application of long-standing control procedures for tenders. before com-
        mitments are taken, projects presenting specific risks, in particular those that exceed the thresholds stated in the general guidelines, are
        reviewed by business line risk committees. the vinci risk committee reviews the largest projects.

        in the contracting business (vinci energies, eurovia, vinci construction), group companies, through the work of their expertise teams, seek
        to avoid project performance risks at an early stage through the terms and conditions of submissions, and in particular the associated techni-
        cal, legal and financial commitments.

        the group’s diversity in geographical locations and customers – with some 41% of revenue coming from public-sector clients in the contracting
        business – also contributes to risk distribution. at vinci construction france, approximately 40% of revenue is generated by contracts that
        are individually worth less than €5 million. the group’s policy is to opt for high technical value-added projects, allowing its know-how to be
        leveraged in countries where the environment is known and manageable. furthermore, these major projects are often carried out in joint
        ventures with other companies, which limits the group’s risk exposure.

        new public-private partnership (ppp) and concession projects are systematically submitted to vinci’s risk committee for examination and
        approval. in addition, in order to limit commitments and the amount of risk capital invested by the group in special purpose vehicles, these
        projects are generally developed in partnership with other companies and are substantially financed by debt, generally with no or limited
        recourse against vinci.

1.1.2   property commitments
        the group’s property development activities are mainly carried out through its specialised subsidiary, vinci immobilier. this company’s
        activities are concentrated in the greater paris area and france’s main conurbations. in 2012, these operations accounted for less than 2% of
        the group’s revenue. vinci immobilier’s most physical commitments undergo systematic prior examination by the vinci risk committee
        and are subsequently subject to detailed reporting and regular follow-up by vinci immobilier. some vinci subsidiaries may also participate
        in property development transactions as part of their construction activities, most of which are in france. these projects are systematically
        submitted to the vinci risk committee for prior examination and approval. the group’s policy is to undertake new projects only if the risks
        related to the property and construction are under control and if the pre-sale rate is sufficiently high.

1.1.3   acquisitions and disposals
        to limit the risks associated with the integration of newly acquired companies and to be able to apply the group’s management principles in
        them, vinci’s policy is to take a majority interest in acquisitions. most proposed acquisitions and disposals are submitted to the vinci risk
        committee for approval. the largest projects are also submitted to the board of directors, following examination by the strategy and investment
        committee (see paragraph 3.4.2 of the section entitled “corporate governance” contained in the report of the chairman of the board of
        directors on corporate governance and internal control procedures, page 183).

      vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the board of directors                                                                 121




1.2           performance of contracts
1.2.1         general risks
              in all of its business lines, vinci’s subsidiaries are exposed to risks that can affect satisfactory performance. these relate to the following
              fields:

              human resources management
              vinci’s success resides in the quality of its managerial model and its ability to attract, train and motivate its employees. group companies are
              exposed to events capable of affecting this resource: employee departures, difficulties connected with recruitment and training in key job
              functions (management, supervisory and specialist trades), employees’ health and safety, personnel costs and industrial action.

              vinci considers the health and safety of its personnel and third parties involved with or affected by its operations to be a major priority. it has
              therefore set up a health and safety policy, which includes, in addition to accident prevention measures, actions relating to occupational ill-
              nesses and pandemics.

              vinci has set up a workforce planning system to handle the risks related to the availability and/or suitability of technical, administrative or
              financial staff at management, white- and blue-collar worker level. this system is intended to anticipate future workloads and the resources
              needed.

              detailed information on vinci’s social responsibility approach is given in the report of the board of directors – e. social and environmental
              information, on page 138.

              cost increases
              vinci is potentially exposed to cost increases, particularly in the prices of some commodities and materials (examples include oil products,
              steel and cement). these issues are analysed for each core business in section 1.2.2. below. commodities risk is also covered in section 2.3.

              subcontractors, joint contractors and suppliers
              the quality of work done by other companies working with vinci and sometimes their default may affect the satisfactory performance of
              projects. given the diverse nature of vinci’s business activities and its decentralised organisation, which reflects the essentially local character
              of its markets, the group considers that it has little dependence on any given subcontractor, joint contractor or supplier.

              vinci companies usually guard against this type of risk by selecting partners carefully, monitoring progress and taking any corrective measures
              needed during the project life.

              security context and social, political or economic unrest (country risk)
              given the large number of countries where the group operates, some activities may occasionally be affected by industrial action, various
              forms of political unrest (riots, terrorism, armed conflict, embargoes, seizure of equipment, etc.), as well as malevolent acts such as vandalism
              and theft on construction sites, or criminal acts such as kidnapping.

              vinci’s safety/security department makes information available to business lines to ensure the best possible preparation for work and travel,
              and makes recommendations to ensure the protection of people and goods. it can also be called on to conduct site audits and/or implement
              regularly updated security plans. moreover, it intervenes within the framework of crisis management, in particular for staff evacuation.

              in addition to the aforementioned events, malevolent acts may include cyber attacks and fraud attempts. the group’s finance department,
              in conjunction with the safety/security department, has set down the instructions to follow in such cases.

              the economic situation in europe and/or a slowdown in emerging economies’ growth could lead to a worsening of conditions in markets
              where vinci operates.
              across its contracting business lines, vinci generates over 57% of total revenue in france, 85% in europe and more than 3% in north america.
              in 2012 concessions generated 94% of revenue in france (essentially vinci autoroutes), 97% in europe and, hence, only 3% outside of europe,
              of which more than one-third was in north america.
              country risk is analysed prior to the submission of the tender for new projects and is monitored by indicators established on site for projects
              or current operations (see report of the chairman of the board of directors on corporate governance and internal control procedures, page 188).
              the various property operations conducted by vinci immobilier or vinci construction subsidiaries are handled mainly in france.

              financial risk is analysed in paragraph 2.3.

              natural events
              like any other company, vinci may be affected by natural events (e.g. earthquakes, floods, cyclones, windstorms, lightning, etc.), which can
              interrupt operations or trigger the collapse or accidental destruction of group infrastructure assets under construction or in use. such events
              may result in an interruption to business for the relevant entity and could also entail a substantial hike in the costs involved in maintaining or
              repairing facilities. part of these expenses may be borne by insurance policies.

              as for crisis management, the actions to be undertaken and training provided entail alert procedures, the triggering of crisis measures, and
              the management of and exit from crises. this central organisation is cascaded in the group’s subsidiaries, which have also set up their own
              crisis management and communication arrangements.

1.2.2   risks specific to vinci’s business lines
        the vinci companies within each of the group’s business lines are exposed to events, the prevention, control and daily management of which
        lie at the heart of their business.

        concessions and public-private partnerships (ppp)
        some risks may remain with the granting authority, in particular in relation to making land available. however, default by the authority cannot
        be ruled out. risks connected with design and construction are generally transferred by the special purpose vehicles (spvs) holding the ppp
        or concession contract to the contractors in charge of construction. financing risks, however, remain the responsibility of the spvs and their
        shareholders (see section 2.4).

        regarding concessions operation, the main risks relate to changes in traffic levels or infrastructure usage, and customer-users’ acceptance
        of tolling and toll charges whenever toll receipts account for virtually all the revenue. traffic levels on motorway concessions are correlated to
        economic activity, especially heavy goods vehicle traffic. they may also be affected by fuel prices, whether for heavy or light vehicles.

        risks connected with changes in the legal and regulatory environment during the lifetime of contracts must be assessed on the basis of the
        contractual framework governing their terms. this framework may or may not provide for compensation mechanisms applying in the event
        of changes in the legislative, regulatory or tax framework, or in the event of the contract’s early termination.

        concession companies’ toll increases, in particular for motorway tolls, are generally linked to inflation. these companies are therefore exposed
        to a contraction in the inflation rate.

        the group’s reputation may be tarnished in the event of default in the quality of services provided (maintenance of the road network, vehicle
        recovery, exceptional events management, required performance levels).

        a centralised system involving public order authorities has been established in vinci autoroutes to combat toll fraud.

        for motorway infrastructure, the cost of renewing surface courses, the wear of which is related to traffic intensity, is covered by heavy-
        maintenance provisions, as specified in note 21.3 to the consolidated financial statements (page 244).

        the main financial, legal and regulatory risks are described in paragraphs 2 and 3 dealing respectively with financial and legal risks, below.

        contracting (vinci energies, eurovia, vinci construction)
        the relationship between the group’s businesses and their clients may be deteriorated by unilateral decisions taken by the latter (early contract
        termination) or by their default (late payments or even insolvency). as such, measures to manage contracts, cash flow and components of
        working capital needs are set up and closely monitored.

        obtaining official authorisations (in particular planning permission, environmental permits and acceptance certificates prior to commissioning)
        may represent unknowns that are managed on a case-by-case basis by clearly planning the various steps preceding the construction and
        acceptance of the structure.

        the timetable and/or construction cost can differ from bid estimates as both depend on a wide range of parameters, some of which are dif-
        ficult to anticipate such as:
        ˇˇ weather conditions (see “natural events”, above);
        ˇˇ changes in the cost of labour, subcontracting, materials, commodities and energy (see above).
        risks relating to changes in costs are handled in different ways:
        ˇˇ the use of revision clauses and the short duration of most contracts mitigate but do not eliminate unit cost inflation risk;
        ˇˇ although vinci bears the risk relating to its own personnel costs directly, the risk of hikes in outsourcing costs may be transferred to sub-
        contractors and suppliers by means of fixed-price agreements with them.

        commodity price exposure varies according to business activities. oil prices mainly affect eurovia, which uses bitumen to build roads, fuel oil
        for industrial facilities and petrol/diesel for its equipment fleet. this risk is dealt with under market risks in section 2.3. it is worth noting that
        eurovia sources 37% of its aggregates from group quarries.

        a lack of qualified personnel or inadequate staffing levels may lead to lower-than-expected yields or design or construction errors, leading to
        technical noncompliance, quality shortfalls of the works and even accidents affecting individuals (company, partner employees or third-party
        individuals), the works or other goods. these damages associated with possible repairs to remedy these problems may give rise to additional
        costs and delays in completion. the subsidiary’s reputation may also be affected. however, this risk is reduced by the group’s arrangements
        for recruiting and training operational staff (see 1.2.1).

        for large projects, the technical complexity of the design and construction of unique infrastructure assets, site constraints (presence of
        underground utilities, maintenance of traffic during works, actions of local residents or other third parties), and geological conditions may also
        represent significant threats.

        some of the group’s activities may also be affected by the environmental and technological risks described in paragraph 4.

      vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the board of directors                                                                 123




              property
              the group’s property development activities are exposed to numerous administrative, technical, commercial and fiscal uncertainties that may
              result in delays (or even the abandonment of some projects), budget over-runs and incertitude regarding programme selling prices.



2.            financial risks
2.1           counterparty risk and credit risk
              the group is exposed to counterparty risk stemming from contracts and financial instruments contracted with its financial partners, should
              the debtor refuse to honour all or part of its commitment or be unable to do so. counterparty risk may result in either a loss of value or a loss
              of liquidity. the group is exposed to loss of value in its cash investments, the acquisition of negotiable debt securities, marketable securities,
              financial receivables, derivative instruments and guarantees or sureties received. it is exposed to a loss of liquidity on the amounts of its unused
              confirmed credit facilities.

              vinci is also exposed to credit risk in the event that a customer fails, as described in section 1.2.2.

              the group has also implemented procedures to manage and limit counterparty and credit risk as specified in note 23.5 to the consolidated
              financial statements, page 256.


2.2           liquidity risk
              group liquidity must be evaluated via its cash and confirmed unused credit lines.

              the group’s exposure to liquidity risk relates to its obligations to repay its existing debt (disclosed in note 22.2.1 to the consolidated financial
              statements, page 248), to the financing of its future needs associated in particular with concession companies’ investment programmes (see
              note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, page 224) and with the group’s general needs. details of these obligations and the group’s
              resources to meet them (cash flow surpluses, unused confirmed credit lines, financial ratings, etc.) are given in note 22 to the consolidated
              financial statements on page 245.

              the group diversifies its funding sources by using the bond markets, banks and supranational banking organisations such as the european
              investment bank (eib). details of these sources are specified in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, page 245. net cash is man-
              aged in accordance with the provisions specified in note 22.2.2 to the consolidated financial statements, page 249, backed by reporting which
              specifies the yield of various assets and monitors the level of associated risks.

              some financing agreements include pre-payment clauses in the event of non-compliance with financial ratios and covenants. these are
              described in note 22.2.5 to the consolidated financial statements, page 250. the thresholds imposed on these ratios were being complied
              with at 31 december 2012.


2.3           market risks (interest rate, currency, commodity and equity risks)
              because of its level of net borrowings, vinci is exposed to interest rate variations (mainly in the eurozone) relating to its floating-rate debt and
              to changes in credit spreads applied by lenders. vinci is also exposed to currency risk stemming from its activities outside france. however,
              these risks are relatively limited, because about 26% of revenue is generated outside the eurozone. management of interest rate and foreign
              exchange risks is explained in notes 23.1 and 23.3 to the consolidated financial statements, pages 251 and 254.

              as stated in notes 1.2.2 and 23.4 to the consolidated financial statements, a large share of the group’s revenue is generated under short-term
              contracts or contracts containing price-indexing clauses. unprocessed raw materials form a relatively small proportion of cost structures. as
              a general rule, the risk on commodity price increases is fairly limited.

              in the case of large-scale contracts with non-revisable prices, commodity risks are assessed on a case-by-case basis and managed, whenever
              possible, using suitable methods such as:
              ˇˇ firm price agreements with suppliers for a given time period;
              ˇˇ cash-and-carry deals, with supplies bought or paid for by the client at the beginning of the work project;
              ˇˇ more marginally, hedging derivatives based on commodity indexes, particularly where the supplier uses a price review mechanism based
              on an index that can be hedged in financial markets, etc.

              equity risk relates to shares held by vinci: adp, assets to cover retirement benefit obligations, and treasury shares. this risk is described in
              note 23.2 to the consolidated financial statements, page 254, and point 3 in note c3 (treasury shares) to the parent company financial state-
              ments, page 283.


2.4	impact of public-private partnerships (ppps) and concession contracts on the group’s
     financial situation
              following review by the risk committee of the business line concerned, these projects are submitted to the vinci risk committee for exami-
              nation and approval. projects are generally carried out through special purpose vehicles (spvs) dedicated solely to the project. these spvs are
              financed by loans made directly to them, with little or no recourse against their shareholders, backed by the future revenues or receivables
              while minimising the capital outlay. the latter varies according to the nature of the risks involved (e.g. traffic volumes and country), the amount
              of project financing and the share of financing assured by the concession-granting authority. floating-rate debt raised by spvs is generally
              covered by fixed-rate hedges for a very large proportion in accordance with the commitments made to lenders.

124                                           report of the board of directors




3.    legal risks
3.1   legal and regulatory compliance
      given the diversity of their activities and geographical locations, the group’s companies operate within specific legal and regulatory environ-
      ments that vary depending on the place where the service is provided and on the sector involved.

      in particular, they must comply with rules on:
      ˇˇ the terms of agreement and performance of public- and private-sector contracts and orders;
      ˇˇ laws governing construction activities and the applicable technical rules governing the delivery of services, supplies and works; and
      ˇˇ environmental, commercial, labour, competition, finance and securities laws.


      with respect to concession operations, the group is dependent on public authorities that may, as is the case in france, have the right to
      unilaterally alter the terms and conditions of public service, ppp and concession contracts during their execution phase or even terminate the
      contract itself, subject to compensation.

      group companies’ operations could result in them being held civilly or criminally liable in france and other countries and in them bearing the
      financial or administrative consequences. similarly, group executives and employees may also be held criminally liable.

      a large share of the risks of non-compliance is therefore likely to lie firstly with executives and/or company officers and with employees to
      whom responsibility has been delegated.

      business lines regularly hold awareness-raising and training sessions based on the group’s code of ethics and conduct in order to limit these
      risks and in particular to prevent conflicts of interest and anti-competitive conduct. the group’s commitments are described in the “social
      responsibility” chapter, page 159.

      the financial risks relating to the potential invoking of group companies’ civil liability are covered by insurance policies described under para-
      graph 5 “insurance cover against risks” (see below).

      the report of the chairman of the board of directors on corporate governance and internal control procedures includes a paragraph on
      compliance with laws and regulations in force, page 179.


3.2   contractual relationships
      all the group’s business activity is based on contracts, mostly subject to the laws of the countries where the project is carried out, engaging
      the responsibility of the contracting parties.
      disputes may arise during the performance of said contracts.
      the group’s policy is to reduce its exposure by negotiating, in the proposal phase, clauses in order to:
      ˇˇ pass onto the client the extra costs and/or delays stemming from changes in the client’s requests;
      ˇˇ allow project shutdown in case of non-payment;
      ˇˇ exclude indirect damages;
      ˇˇ exclude or limit responsibility related to existing pollution;
      ˇˇ limit its contractual responsibility for the total project to a reasonable percentage of the contract’s price;
      ˇˇ cap delay and performance penalties to an acceptable percentage of the contract price;
      ˇˇ stipulate contractual provisions allowing for adjustments (price, time schedule) to account for legal, fiscal or regulatory changes;
      ˇˇ obtain protection via a force majeure clause (against political risk, client’s unilateral decision) or for early contract termination;
      ˇˇ obtain an international arbitration clause for contracts outside france.


      detailed information on the principal disputes and arbitrations in which the group is involved can be found in section h of the notes to the
      consolidated financial statements, page 265. these known disputes are examined on the date of approval of the financial statements and,
      following the review by legal advisers, the provisions deemed necessary are, as the case may be, constituted to cover the estimated risks.



4.    environmental and technological risks
      environmental risks are those that have an impact on the natural environment. they may be directly linked to:
      ˇˇ the occurrence of technological accidents;
      ˇˇ the usage, handling or transport of hazardous substances;
      ˇˇ the emission or release into the air or water of toxic and hazardous substances, waste or co .
                                                                                                     2
      technological risk, which stems from human activity, entails accidents occurring in industrial or nuclear installations.


4.1   environmentally related economic and regulatory context
      the sources of environmentally related risks and opportunities are essentially concentrated in two fields:
      ˇˇ the competitive market with opportunities generated by growth in client demand for renewable energy generation or for products that
      consume less energy (low energy buildings);
      ˇˇ legal and regulatory compliance resulting from international or national changes in environmental protection regulations, which are often
      made stricter, in particular to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or conserve biodiversity.

      vinci 2012 annual report                                report of the board of directors                                                               125




              only one vinci facility is concerned by france’s national greenhouse gas quota plan (pnaq ii): cifc’s plant (part of eurovia) at fos sur mer
              near marseille. an approved auditor verifies the regulatory quota compliance of emissions by no later than 15 february each year. the co2
              emitted by the cifc facility totalled 171,314 tonnes in 2012 due to a significant increase in production. as in 2011, no co2 sales were reported
              in 2012. (as with other environmental indicators, these figures are calculated over the period from 1 october of year y-1 to 30 september of
              year y: see “note on the methods used in social and environmental reporting, page 166”.)


4.2           environmental risks
              some eurovia businesses may face exposure to these risks, which remain limited.
              binder plants: the use or manufacture of products that are potentially hazardous to the environment is subject to continuous monitoring and
              internal inspections by eurovia’s quality, health, safety and environment managers.
              production and application of bituminous mixes: the setting up of an environmental regulation intelligence group for bituminous mix plants
              enables the plant operators to take the action needed to ensure permanent compliance with regulations. regular or unannounced external
              inspections analyse products and measure the quantities in stock to ensure that the plants comply with regulations. performance techniques
              for applying bituminous mixes on worksites are regularly monitored in close conjunction with the relevant health and safety bodies.
              quarries: the sources of pollution identified include noise, vibration and dust emissions. external audits of quarries are made annually by
              approved organisations. dust emissions are inspected in accordance with standards by an external body and a report is submitted annually
              to the regional departments for industry, research and the environment (drire).

              because these risks are limited, no special system has been set up to monitor the costs and investments associated with their prevention.
              however, all identified risks are analysed on a case-by-case basis and provisions are made where necessary. at 31 december 2012, provisions
              related to eurovia, where the main risks in this area lie, amounted to €22.6 million, including €11.3 million in france. corresponding provisions
              identified in vinci’s other subsidiaries stood at around €1 million.

              as a general rule, vinci’s companies are potentially exposed to the consequences of accidental pollution, in particular spillage of hazardous
              materials on its roads network and construction sites. this type of event, which is fortunately rare, can disrupt the particular site or operations
              and necessitate the deployment of crisis arrangements (see section 1.2.1, paragraphs security and social, political or economic context (country
              risk) and natural events).


4.3           technological risks
              the group’s companies have no facilities that present significant health or safety risks for neighbouring populations and the environment, as
              defined under clause iv of article l515-8 of the french environmental code (seveso high threshold).

              they can, however, be indirectly exposed to such risks in the following cases:
              ˇˇ some of the group’s activities may be carried out occasionally or permanently near facilities classified for environmental protection;
              ˇˇ some activities carried out by vinci energies and vinci construction (freyssinet, vinci construction france, soletanche bachy, cfe, vinci
              construction grands projets, entrepose contracting, etc.) take place inside classified facilities (in particular, nuclear power plants or nuclear
              waste treatment facilities). those responsible for such facilities are subject to obligations and must take the necessary measures, especially
              as regards evacuating people.



5.            insurance cover against risks
5.1           general policy
              vinci’s general insurance policy places a strong emphasis on prevention and risk protection. given the group’s decentralised organisation,
              this policy is defined at several levels of responsibility.

              vinci’s executive management lays down the general guidelines and in particular the standards applicable to all subsidiaries.

              within this framework, and after rigorously identifying and analysing the risks relating to their activities, the managers of the business lines
              or major subsidiaries define the optimum trade-off between the level and extent of the guarantees likely to meet the range of insurable risks,
              and a cost (comprising premiums and uninsured losses) allowing business units to remain competitive. with a view to preventing accidents
              and optimising costs, uninsured losses are defined on an individual subsidiary basis.

              self-insurance budgets have been set up for civil liability, motor vehicle insurance and damage insurance at eurovia, vinci construction france
              and vinci energies.

              in addition to subsidiaries’ specific cover, vinci has also taken out cover on behalf of all its subsidiaries, in particular regarding:
              ˇˇ supplementary civil liability cover in addition to the first levels of cover arranged by subsidiaries;
              ˇˇ civil liability protection for company officers;
              ˇˇ liability for environmental damage.


              vinci has its own brokerage firm, vinci assurances, in charge of consolidating insurance policies and harmonising cover within the group.
              vinci assurances acts as a broker for most of the french subsidiaries and, as an intermediary, bears no financial risk as an insurer.

126                                           report of the board of directors




5.2   loss prevention and claims record
      loss prevention arrangements are systematically adopted on construction sites and operating sites. this policy, which gives a major role to
      training, forms part of vinci companies’ approach in the areas of quality assurance and prevention of work-place accidents.

      the group’s claims record in the area of civil liability is characterised, on the basis of available statistics and data and without prejudging any
      actual responsibility, by a low number of incidents involving more than €1 million, by a few medium-sized incidents, ranging from €100,000
      to €1 million, and by a relatively irreducible number of small incidents (some several thousand) of less than €100,000 each, which, to a great
      extent, are borne directly by subsidiaries as uninsured losses or under self-insurance cover.


5.3   insurance in the construction, roads and energy business lines
      civil liability
      subsidiaries are exposed to their responsibility for bodily, physical or immaterial damage caused to third parties, including clients or employers.

      the civil liability cover taken out by the group comprises a first line that combines the cover in place at subsidiary level, intended to cover
      usual incidents, and a set of complementary lines taken out for the common benefit by vinci.

      in addition to this basic cover, specific insurance is taken out as a result of legal or contractual requirements or management decisions, par-
      ticularly in areas such as:
      ˇˇ 10-year liability (in france);
      ˇˇ motor insurance.


      property insurance
      contractor’s all risks (car) insurance is generally taken out in respect of major construction sites. in particular, this covers physical damage
      arising from accidents or natural events up to the value of the project as a maximum.

      office buildings and fixed production facilities are covered for a contractual rebuilding value, either value as new or an estimate of the maximum
      insurable loss. site plant and equipment is covered on a case-by-case basis and, if financially worthwhile, depending on value, type and age.

      road vehicles, which are mostly pooled within fleets by subsidiary, are not generally covered on a comprehensive basis.


5.4   insurance in concessions and services business lines
      property insurance
      concession operation involves a potential exposure of the group to damage to assets under concession, whether accidental or not, that could
      result in an obligation to rebuild (bearing the related costs), as well as to financial consequences due to the interruption of operations and
      obligations to providers of finance relating to debt servicing. as a general rule, bridges, tunnels and car parks are insured from their entry into
      service for their cost of reconstruction in the event of accidental destruction. this is not, however, the case for motorways and rail lines where
      complete destruction is not envisaged.

      civil liability
      assets operated under concession contracts by vinci subsidiaries in france or abroad are also covered by specific civil liability insurance
      arrangements, which are coordinated with the complementary cover at group level. to date, no claim has been settled under these further
      lines of insurance in the concessions and services business lines. these arrangements are specifically designed to meet local legal require-
      ments and those laid down in concession agreements. concession operations in which vinci is a minority shareholder do not generally benefit
      from the group’s complementary civil liability cover taken out on behalf of all entities.

      business interruption insurance
      business interruption insurance is intended to allow concession operators to restore an income stream interrupted or reduced by an accidental
      event affecting the normal operation of an asset, thus enabling the operator to meet any financial commitments towards lenders and cover
      ordinary operating overheads during the reconstruction period.

      for bridges, tunnels and car parks, losses from interruption to business are generally covered subject to various levels of uninsured loss. losses
      may be expressed as an amount or as a number of days of interruption. long motorways and rail lines, which have little exposure to this risk,
      are not systematically insured against such losses since a long-term or complete stoppage of operations is not taken into consideration.
      uninsured amounts are determined on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the concession’s earnings are not materially affected by an accidental
      interruption in traffic.

              appointment, the only directors’ fees he receives are those paid in respect of appointments in other group companies.
              (**) mr huillard had the use of a company car in 2011 and 2012.



              xavier huillard’s remuneration package is described on page 186.
              at its meeting of 5 february 2013, the board of directors decided, in respect of 2012 and as proposed by the remuneration committee, to
              set the portion of the variable component of mr huillard’s remuneration based on financial criteria, after calculating the performance index,
              at €581,200 and the managerial portion at €420,000, making a total variable component of €1,001,200 before deducting directors’ fees
              amounting to €13,670 paid in 2012.

3.2.2         long-term incentive plan
              at its meeting of 3 march 2010, the board decided to set up a long-term incentive plan to be awarded to xavier huillard, the features of which
              are described in section 4.1 of the report of the chairman on page 186. this plan gives rise to an annual allocation that mr huillard will only
              be eligible to receive if he completes his term in office (except in specific cases). each year, the company sets aside a provision corresponding
              to the value, at market conditions prevailing on 31 december, of the likely amount. at 31 december 2012, the total provision recognised in
              respect of this plan from its inception at 6 may 2010 amounted to €1,714,701.

3.2.3         obligations in respect of supplementary retirement plans
              like other senior executives of vinci sa with at least 10 years’ service, xavier huillard is eligible for coverage under a collective pension plan,
              the purpose of which, subject to certain conditions being met and, more particularly, that he is still employed by the company, is to guarantee
              the individuals concerned a supplementary annual pension upon their retirement of between 20% and 40% of the average annual remunera-
              tion received in the 36 months preceding their departure. this supplementary pension plan will be limited to an annual amount that will gradually
              increase to a maximum of eight times the french social security ceiling at 1 january 2019.
              as the application of this plan constitutes a commitment subject to the procedure for the authorisation of regulated agreements in accordance
              with article l.225-42-1 of the french commercial code, it required the approval of the shareholders’ general meeting, which was given on
              6 may 2010.
              at 31 december 2012, vinci’s obligations in respect of the retirement benefits described above for mr huillard amounted to €4,970,500.
              retirement benefit obligations are also described on page 238 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

3.2.4         summary table

4.                options and performance shares
4.1               policy on granting of options or performance shares
                  two authorisations given to vinci’s board of directors remained valid in 2012: one conferred by the shareholders’ general meeting of
                  2 may 2011 to grant share subscription options and another conferred by the shareholders’ general meeting of 12 april 2012 to grant per-
                  formance shares. in 2012, an incentive plan was set up, resulting either in the granting of performance shares alone, or the combined granting
                  of share subscription options and performance shares, depending on the beneficiary’s management level.
                  vinci’s policy consists of granting performance shares and options to a significant number of group executives and employees (a total of
                  about 1,900) in order to allow them to share in its performance and ensure their long-term commitment.

4.2.2      options granted in 2012
           a) general information
           at its meeting of 12 april 2012, the board of directors decided to use the authorisation given by the shareholders’ general meeting of
           2 may 2011 to set up a plan for the granting of options to subscribe to the company’s shares, with effect from 12 april 2012. this plan provides
           for the granting of 2,457,980 options to subscribe to the company’s shares to 302 group executives and employees. no options have been
           granted to the executive company officer under this plan.

           each option gives the right to subscribe to one new vinci share, at a subscription price of €39.04. the definitive granting of options is subject
           to the performance criteria determined by the board of directors under the conditions defined by the shareholders’ general meeting, which
           require that, in the financial years 2012 and 2013, the vinci group’s average return on capital employed (roce) be higher than 6%, after
           restating for any non-controlling interests greater than 33.33%. the actual number of options granted will be equivalent to 100% of the options
           originally granted if the roce is equal to 7% and the proportion will be set by linear interpolation if this rate is between 6% and 7%.

           options that have been definitively granted in line with the performance criteria may only be exercised by the beneficiaries on or after
           12 april 2015 provided they are still actively employed by the group. shares acquired through the exercise of options may not be transferred
           or sold before expiry of a four-year holding period in accordance with tax rules, other than in the event of death, permanent disability or invol-
           untary retirement.
           beneficiaries also have a right to early exercise of options definitively granted after verification of the performance criteria in the event of a
           public offer being made for the company’s shares.
           the validity period for the options is seven years with effect from 12 april 2012 and thus expires on 12 april 2019.
           no subsidiary controlled by vinci has granted share subscription or purchase options.

           b) granting of options to the executive company officer
           no options were granted in 2012 to mr xavier huillard, chairman and chief executive officer.

           c) granting of options to the 10 group employees (not company officers of vinci sa) to whom the largest number of options were
           granted
           the number of options granted during the year by vinci and by other group companies entitled to grant options to the 10 group employees
           (not company officers of vinci sa) who were granted the largest number of options was 336,015, corresponding to 13.67% of the total
           number.

4.2.3      options exercised in 2012
           a) general information
           between 1 january and 31 december 2012, 3,014,216 options were exercised, comprising 3,013,216 subscription options and 1,000 purchase
           options. during this same period, 6,756,939 options were cancelled or expired, of which 3,453,554 were subscription options and 3,213,385
           were purchase options.
           taking all these elements into account, a total of 14,500,100 options remained to be exercised at 31 december 2012, at an average exercise
           price of €35.93, all of which were subscription options.

4.2.4           definitive granting of options at 9 july 2012 under the plan set up by the board of directors on 9 july 2010
                under the plan set up on 9 july 2010, the definitive granting of options is subject to the performance criteria determined by the shareholders’
                general meeting, namely that the board of directors will note, at the end of a period of two years starting on 9 july 2010, any changes in the
                vinci share price and will determine the proportion of options to be definitively granted having regard to the share’s performance compared
                with that of an index initially comprising 13 european companies from the construction and infrastructure concessions sector. the board
                reserves the right to make any weightings reflecting in particular the market capitalisation of companies and to exclude from the list certain
                companies that, during the reference period, may have been the subject of exceptional transactions or de-listing or that may have experienced
                atypical share price changes and to replace them if applicable with an index such as the euro stoxx index. the number of options finally granted
                will depend on the percentage change in the performance of the vinci share against the index; 100% of the options will be granted if this rate
                is higher than 5% and 0% if it is lower than -5%. if the rate is between these two limits of +5% and -5%, the proportion will be determined by
                linear interpolation.
                at its meeting of 19 june 2012, the board of directors gave full powers to the chairman and chief executive officer to take note of any change
                in the performance index and thereby determine the proportion of options to be granted in accordance with the provisions of the plan.
                on 9 july 2012, the chairman and chief executive officer noted that the vinci share had outperformed the index by 9.9% and therefore
                decided that all of the share subscription options that had been originally granted to the beneficiaries would be deemed to be definitively
                granted to them at this same date (4,074,560 options granted to 1,661 beneficiaries). it is to be understood that these options will only be
                definitively granted to their beneficiaries and may only be exercised by them from 9 july 2013 at the determined exercise price of €36.70
                provided the beneficiaries meet the conditions to be considered as active employees laid down by the board in its meeting of 9 july 2010.

           b) number of performance shares granted to the executive company officer
           mr xavier huillard, chairman and chief executive officer, was not granted any performance shares under the plans described above.

           at its meeting of 27 february 2007, the board of directors of vinci decided that executive company officers would be required to retain at
           least one-quarter of any performance shares received for the duration of their appointment. in accordance with this rule, xavier huillard, who
           has been definitively granted 40,874 performance shares under the plans set up in 2007 and 2008, is required to retain 10,219 shares until
           the expiry of his term of office.

4.3.2      establishment of the 2012 plan
           at its meeting of 12 april 2012, the board of directors decided to use the authorisation given by the shareholders’ general meeting of
           12 april 2012 to set up a plan for the granting of company performance shares, with effect from 12 april 2012. this plan provides for the
           granting of 2,202,580 existing shares to 1,881 beneficiaries. no performance shares have been granted to the executive company officer
           under this plan. the plan stipulates that the shares are only deemed to be definitively granted at the end of a two-year vesting period, which
           will expire on 12 april 2014.
           the definitive granting of shares is subject to the following performance criteria:
           ˇˇ for beneficiaries who were members of the executive committee at 12 april 2012, performance shares are only deemed to be definitively
           granted if, in respect to both 2012 and 2013, the vinci group’s average return on capital employed (roce) is higher than 8%, after restating
           for any non-controlling interests greater than 33.33%. the number of performance shares finally granted will depend on this rate; 100% of the
           shares will be granted if the roce is higher than 9% and the proportion will be set by linear interpolation if the rate is between 8% and 9%;
           ˇˇ for beneficiaries who were not members of the executive committee at 12 april 2012, performance shares are only deemed to be definitively
           granted if, in respect to both 2012 and 2013, the vinci group’s average return on capital employed (roce) is higher than 6%, after restating
           for any non-controlling interests greater than 33.33%. the number of performance shares finally granted will depend on this rate; 100% of the
           shares will be granted if the roce is higher than 7% and the proportion will be set by linear interpolation if the rate is between 6% and 7%;
           ˇˇ the board of directors decided not to take the impact of the acquisition of airport company ana into account in the calculation of the roce.
           the plan also provides that the shares granted in this way must be retained for two years, i.e. until 12 april 2016, during which time they may
           not be transferred or sold, other than in the event of permanent disability or death. the number of shares originally granted by the board of
           directors on 12 april 2012 to the 10 employees who were not company officers and had been granted the largest number of shares was
           96,004; the number of shares granted to the members of the executive committee was 110,004, thus about 4.99% of the total number
           granted.

4.3.3	definitive granting of performance shares on 9 july 2012 under the plan set up by the board of directors on
       9 july 2010
           the plan set up on 9 july 2010, with effect from the same date, stipulates that shares are only definitively granted if performance criteria are
           met and at the end of a two-year vesting period expiring on 9 july 2012. shares are only definitively granted if, in respect of both 2010 and
           2011, the vinci group’s average return on capital employed (roce) is higher than 5%, after restating for any non-controlling interests greater
           than 33.33%. the number of performance shares finally granted will depend on this rate; 100% of the shares will be granted if the roce is
           higher than 6% and the proportion will be set by linear interpolation if the rate is between 5% and 6%.
           on 19 june 2012, the board of directors noted that the vinci group’s average return on capital employed (roce) amounted to 9.2% on aver-
           age for the 2010 and 2011 financial years (after restating for non-controlling interests).
           consequently, at its meeting of 19 june 2012, the board decided to definitively grant, as at 9 july 2012, to the 1,685 beneficiaries 100% of the
           performance shares that were originally granted to them, representing 1,607,900 shares. beneficiaries may not transfer or sell these shares
           for an additional two-year holding period that will expire on 9 july 2014.

e.    social and environmental information
      this report is compiled pursuant to articles l. 225-102-1, r. 225-104 and r. 225-105 of the french commercial code, and is based on such
      international reporting guidelines and standards as the global reporting initiative and iso 26000. the aim of this report is to comply with the
      application of the draft decree relating to corporate transparency obligations on social and environmental matters.

      it contains three sections:
      ˇˇ workforce-related responsibility (pages 139 to 150);
      ˇˇ environment (pages 150 to 159);
      ˇˇ social responsibility (pages 159 to 168).


      vinci’s sustainable development policy and strategy are presented on pages 18 to 29 of this annual report. additional, regularly updated
      information is available on the group’s website at www.vinci.com, in particular examples of the innovative approaches implemented by the
      group’s companies, arranged by category and type of challenge. since 2002, vinci has requested the opinion of its statutory auditors on its
      social and environmental reporting procedures, which form part of a single reporting system, and on a selection of performance indicators.
      information about this audit work, along with a note about the methods used, is presented on pages 166-168 and 177-178. in addition to
      complying strictly with legislation, vinci has voluntarily committed to observing the 10 principles of the un’s global compact and to reporting
      annually on its initiatives in this area. vinci has also made a commitment to french non-profit organisation amis du global compact france
      to promote these initiatives among businesses. “advance”, a method developed by vinci in the form of a sustainable development self-
      diagnosis questionnaire, enables managers to review the group’s workforce-related, environmental and social categories, and take strategic
      decisions related to them. the method was developed in accordance with the principles of the global compact, the fundamental conventions
      of the ilo (international labour organisation) and iso 26000.

1.            workforce-related responsibility
1.1           general human resources policy
              see also page 27 of this annual report
              manifesto commitment number 7: “promote sustainable careers together”

              this section follows precisely and thoroughly article 225 of france’s grenelle ii environment law. it is also based on the principles of the gri
              (global reporting initiative), in particular in its version 4 draft, which should be issued in the course of 2013.

              vinci’s business model is based on a complementary set of short- and long-term business activities, performed through a decentralised
              organisation. vinci’s employees are vital to the success of its business model. its operating methods therefore prioritise people over systems,
              and are based on the view that sustained business success requires an ambitious approach to human resources.

              as part of its forward-looking management approach to jobs and skills, since 2010 the group has applied employee development plans,
              involving an annual appraisal for each group employee, along with the requirement for entities to carry out a collegial workforce review and
              implement individual development plans covering areas such as job mobility and training.

              as a major player in sectors that are highly fragmented and extremely competitive, vinci works hard to set an example. as a result, vinci is
              ranked among the top 10 best places to work for french engineering students according to the universum 2012 survey.


1.2           employment
1.2.1         workforce
              at the end of 2012, vinci had 192,701 þ employees, up 5.1% relative to 2011, in around a hundred countries. thanks to a dynamic recruitment
              and external growth policy, the group’s workforce has grown by more than 21% over the past five years, with european entities representing
              close to 83% of the total workforce in 2012.

              the proportion of employees outside europe increased slightly, from 15.7% of the total workforce to 17.2% in 2012. in the context of a difficult
              economic situation in europe, vinci’s businesses are implementing a number of human resources management methods, including more
              coordination between regional activities and solidarity measures to optimise job transfers between regions and sectors in order to keep pace
              with changing activities.

          þ data checked by the statutory auditors; for the 2012 data, see page 177 of the 2012 annual report.


          over the past five years, the share of the workforce aged under 25 has been maintained at around 10%, which is the sign of a sound age pyra-
          mid. also, the share of the workforce aged over 50 has increased 4.5% over five years. in total the under-25s and the over-50s have increased
          7%, which is higher than the overall 5% increase in the total workforce between 2011 and 2012.

1.2.2     recruitment and departures
          in five years, vinci’s workforce has expanded to 192,701 þ employees in 2012 from 158,628 in 2007. employee turnover of about 27% per
          year reflects the expiry of worksite contracts, which is offset by the group’s active recruitment policy adapted to new worksites.

1.2.2.1   recruitment
          in 2012, vinci hired 52,999 þ people worldwide, including 23,855 on a permanent basis (9,899 in france). the portion of permanent contracts
          (unlimited term and site contracts) has risen from 41% to over 45% in two years. vinci’s goal is to accelerate its pace of international hires.
          during 2012, vinci again pursued its policy of active recruitment. in particular, 2,309 young people were hired for their first work experience,
          accounting for 4.3% of all new hires.

1.2.2.2   types of employment contract
          the proportion of permanent jobs has been stable at about 88% of the workforce over the past five years. of the group’s þ 192,701 employees
          worldwide, 168,738 have permanent jobs. in france, especially in the construction sector, site contracts are considered permanent jobs. at
          31 december 2012, 19,517 people were employed under fixed-term employment contracts. vinci promotes local employment and encour-
          ages career progression within the group. intra-group transfers increased 22%, rising from 2,400 in 2011 to 2,938 in 2012. group companies
          support international volunteering programmes that give graduates the opportunity to work abroad, and 194 people were welcomed under
          these programmes in 2012. the group had 1,535 expatriate employees at end-2012.

          the group’s business lines use temporary employees to adjust their labour needs to the pace of their business activities and find new profiles
          for company hiring. in 2012, 15,206 temporary employees (full-time equivalent) worked for vinci in france.

1.2.2.3     reasons for departure

              the contracting business lines (energy, roads and construction) execute their projects at temporary worksites and over a relatively short
              period. they traditionally employ a large number of people whose contracts expire once the project is completed or who seek employment
              with another local company to avoid having to move. in the concessions business, and particularly in the motorways business line, seasonal
              variations in activity also explain the relatively large proportion of expired contracts.

1.2.2.4       workforce reduction and employment protection plans, redeployment efforts, rehiring and support measures
              after a period of intense recruitment, some business activities must now contend with restructuring in the context of the economic and
              financial crisis. since vinci’s operations cannot be relocated, senior management and human resources managers work together to ensure
              economic and social solidarity through job mobility and redeployment plans, which are facilitated by the group’s extensive presence. similarly,
              when vinci makes an acquisition, it strives to retain staff whenever possible, since they are the guardians of valuable skills and expertise
              needed to leverage group synergies, share resources and drive networking. some group companies occasionally implement redundancy
              plans or redeploy employees. vinci’s human resources department and local hr managers regularly review sites that are experiencing
              business or employment difficulties.


1.3           organisation of working hours
1.3.1         hours worked and overtime
              working hours in all vinci group companies are subject to each country’s legal requirements and collective bargaining agreements. in 2012,
              employees worked almost 328 million þ hours. there were 14 million overtime hours, representing 4% of the total worked. compared with
              2011, overtime hours worked fell 16%.

1.3.2   absenteeism
        employees were absent from work for 3.4 million calendar days in 2012. non-occupational illnesses accounted for 59% of these absences.
        days absent represented 8% of the 44 million days worked worldwide, of which over 23 million in france. the change in data between 2011
        and 2012 is partly explained by a change in the calculation method.

1.4     remuneration, social security payments and employee savings
        see also page 28 of this annual report
        manifesto commitment number 8: “share the benefits of our performance together”

1.4.1   general policy
        the remuneration policy is based on common principles of allowing employees to take part in their company’s success through profit-sharing
        and incentive plans that reward individual performance. it is in keeping with the group’s decentralised management structure. these principles
        are implemented through different means in the various countries where vinci operates, in accordance with national contexts, laws and regu-
        lations. employee remuneration takes different forms: wages, bonuses, profit-sharing, incentive plans, employee share ownership, insurance
        and retirement plans, and other company benefits. vinci supports all of these. all employees, regardless of position, are rewarded in accord-
        ance with their responsibilities and performance.

        at the end of 2012, 92% of employees in france benefited from incentive plans and/or profit-sharing agreements. in total, vinci employees
        in france shared in the group’s growth and success through the distribution of €163.4 million under profit-sharing and incentive plans, which
        represents €3 million or 2% more than five years ago.

        on 22 may 2012, vinci signed a group-wide agreement which enabled each employee to receive a profit-sharing bonus of €367. the agree-
        ment was signed, for the second year running, with the majority of the trade unions in france (cfdt, cftc, cfe-cgc). the bonus, which was
        the same for each employee regardless of his or her basic salary, was paid in july to employees of group companies controlled by vinci. the
        group exceeded its statutory obligations by paying the bonus to those working at companies with fewer than 50 employees (around
        100,000 vinci staff). this bonus payment amounted in total to €36.3 million for the group, compared with €33.7 million in 2011.

1.4.2      remuneration and social security payments
           payroll expenses totalled €6 billion in 2012 (€5.6 billion 2011), equal to 15.5% of revenue in 2012 (15.3% in 2011). payroll-to-revenue has
           remained stable in the past five years.

           remuneration and social security payments vary widely from country to country. there is also a high level of disparity between the salary
           scales (pay gaps) of the “manager” and “non-manager” categories. the level of social security payments also varies radically from country to
           country. vinci presents these consolidated figures for the world and france.

           for france, the presentation shows more precise segmentation: managers; office, technical and supervisory staff; and manual workers. figures
           designate gross annual averages in thousands of euros.

1.4.3      employee savings plans
           vinci continued its employee savings efforts, carrying out three share issues during the year as provided for under the terms of its group
           savings scheme in france. the regularity of share issues ensures the strength and continuity of this scheme, which has been available to
           employees since 1995.

           employee investment in the castor fund, which invests exclusively in vinci shares, is encouraged through a 10% discount on vinci’s share
           price and a sliding scale of employer contributions aimed at encouraging savings by the lowest-paid employees. employer contributions in
           2012 were as follows:
           ˇˇ 100% up to €1,000;
           ˇˇ 70% from €1,001 to €3,000;
           ˇˇ 25% from €3,001 to €5,000;
           ˇˇ 10% from €5,001 to €11,000.
           the maximum employer’s annual contribution per employee is thus €3,500 (see also page 237 of this report for information on 2013).

           the total employer’s contribution was €96.5 million for france in 2012. employees owned almost 10% of the group’s share capital at the end
           of 2012, their confidence in vinci’s future making them once again collectively its largest shareholder. at the end of september 2012, around
           112,285 employees owned shares in vinci through one of the group’s investment funds. the average portfolio was worth about €17,000.

           created in april 2011, vinci’s employee shareholders’ circle provides a new perspective on the group through discussions between employee
           shareholders. the circle boasted 10,800 members at 31 december 2012. during the year under review, vinci continued to promote “rediscover
           your city” events, a concept highlighting the role of its businesses in the development of major urban conglomerations. almost 800 members
           went on cruises organised in paris, bordeaux and lyon, and the first discovery visit was organised in marseille on 29 september. the trips to
           discover vinci projects were appreciated, with 40 people attending the visit to the a89 worksite, 180 going on the two visits to the stade de
           france and 40 visiting the mmarena in le mans.

           the circle offers a toll-free phone number and a secured and personalised space on vinci’s internet and intranet websites. employee share-
           holders may use these facilities to register as circle members or participate in events. the twice-yearly newsletter “en direct” keeps readers
           informed of group events and news.

           to support its international business development, vinci wanted to extend its employee savings arrangements by giving employees in coun-
           tries other than france the chance to acquire (directly or indirectly) vinci shares at preferential prices and thereby give them a greater interest
           in vinci’s financial performance and growth. in 2012, a plan was initiated to benefit employees of subsidiaries in which vinci owns more than
           a 50% stake in 14 countries (the employees must have been with the group for at least six months). the plan covers around 300 subsidiaries
           and 45,000 employees. subject to holding their shares for three years (five years in the uk), employees may receive an employer contribution
           from vinci in the form of a bonus share award, deferred for three years to avoid initial taxation (with exceptions) and dependent on employees
           remaining with the group for the required time period. the countries concerned are belgium, canada, the czech republic, germany, morocco,
           the netherlands, poland, portugal, romania, slovakia, spain, switzerland, the uk and the usa.

        total employee participation came to nearly 25%. in view of this plan’s success, vinci has decided to reinitiate a similar plan in 2013 with
        coverage extending to five other countries, depending on legal feasibility: austria, brazil, chile, indonesia and luxembourg. this will increase
        the plan’s coverage to 60% of employees based outside france.

        the group’s collective retirement savings plan, perco archimède, came into force in december 2010 in france following the collective
        agreement with french trade unions cfdt, cfe-cgc and cftc on 25 june 2010. it rounds out the group savings scheme, and is gradually
        gaining in popularity. this new plan was established to allow employees to offset reduced income from mandatory pension plans and to save
        for retirement under more attractive terms than they could obtain individually. it allows them to:
        ˇˇ receive a lump-sum payment or an annuity upon retirement;
        ˇˇ manage their investment themselves or opt for guided management;
        ˇˇ select from a wide range of investment vehicles in accordance with their particular savings or investment profile.


        vinci makes 50% matching contributions, limited to €200 a year for an employee contribution of €400. at end-september 2012, about 18% of
        employees had joined the perco archimède plan, 67% of whom were under the age of 50. the average portfolio value of nearly €874 represents
        an increase of 43% over 2011; 62% of investments were being managed by employees themselves, with 38% opting for guided management.


1.5     labour relations and collective bargaining agreements
1.5.1   general policy regarding dialogue between management and labour
        vinci’s policy regarding dialogue between management and labour reflects its fundamental principles: recognising the role played by trade
        unions in the group and the right of employees to belong to a union; achieving a constant balance between union involvement and close links
        with professional activities; facilitating communication and meetings between trade union representatives and employee representative
        bodies; ensuring that employee and trade union representatives are properly informed and trained by involving them in the group’s major
        initiatives (e.g. in the areas of health, safety, sustainable development, gender equality, and employing people with disabilities); and working
        to foster communication and collective bargaining worldwide. as laid down in the group’s new manifesto, dialogue between management
        and labour is of capital importance to the discussion of and implementation of its commitments.

        vinci’s decentralised organisational structure enables it to maintain dialogue between management and labour at all levels throughout the
        group. in 2012, 8,181 employees around the world served as employee representatives (including 7,431 in france). an overall budget of €205,000
        is distributed between all the unions as a function of their membership with the aim of assisting them and giving them the means of repre-
        senting the staff.

        in those countries that have not ratified the international labour organisation’s conventions on trade union rights, vinci companies are work-
        ing to give employees the means of expressing themselves. qdvc in qatar, for example, has set up an experimental forum that enables workers
        to express themselves through identified representatives.

1.5.2   employee representative bodies
        employee representative bodies strengthen dialogue between management and labour by working locally with the various organisations that
        oversee occupational hygiene, health, safety and working conditions.

        a number of organisations covering specific cases or national situations have been set up to complement individual companies’ employee
        representative bodies. france, for example, has a group works council comprising representatives from over 50 entities. it meets at least
        twice a year and receives information about the group’s business and financial situation, employment trends and forecasts, and health and
        safety actions at group and company levels. it is kept informed of the economic and business outlook for the coming year and has access to
        the group’s consolidated financial statements and the associated statutory auditors’ reports. it is also informed, prior to any decision, of any
        significant projects that may affect the group’s consolidation scope or its legal or financial structure, and of their potential impact on employ-
        ment. in certain business lines, bodies have also been established for each business activity; vinci energies, for example, has created two
        extra employee representative bodies in order to ensure the continuity of dialogue between management and labour.

        the european works council takes up discussions within these various local or national organisations at the european level. the council’s
        mandate, renewed in 2010 under an agreement unanimously approved by all unions, is composed of representatives from 17 countries in
        which vinci operates: austria, belgium, the czech republic, france, germany, greece, hungary, luxembourg, the netherlands, poland, portugal,
        romania, slovakia, spain, sweden, switzerland and the united kingdom. the role of the council, which meets once a year, is to ensure that the
        employee representatives of the group’s subsidiaries in the european economic area and switzerland are properly informed and consulted.

1.5.3   trade union freedoms
        vinci companies observe the laws and regulations of the countries in which they do business. operational managers are assisted by human
        resources managers, who propose the most appropriate solutions in compliance with local requirements and vinci’s commitments to observe
        trade union freedoms. since 89% of the group’s business is in europe, the european works council is the prime guarantor of freedom of
        association and the right to organise.

1.5.4   collective agreements in 2012
        the collective agreements negotiated and signed by vinci companies are a concrete example of the group’s decentralised approach to human
        resources management, which takes account of the realities on the ground and aims to improve working conditions, health, safety and the
        organisation of working hours. in 2012, 1,347 collective agreements were signed, with 242 of them being outside france.

        an agreement to promote dialogue between management and labour within the french companies of the vinci group was signed with labour
        representatives on 16 december 2011, affirming consultation with employee representatives as one of vinci’s core values. the agreement
        provides for an improvement in information forwarded to employee representatives and for assistance for them during and following the expiry
        of their terms. a joint commission has been set up to offer an alternative to disputes about restrictions on exercising terms of office to represent
        staff. at the end of the term of office, the representatives have the possibility, under certain conditions (commitments and length of term of
        office), of taking a training course that will lead to a qualification enabling them to make use of the skills acquired.

              among major achievements in 2012, over 12% of agreements relate to diversity and equality (up 63% from 2011).

1.5.5         collective conflicts
              in 2012, employee absences due to strikes totalled 8,702 days (of which 3,729 in france), equal to fewer than 0.1% of total days worked. salary
              demands were the main cause of the strikes.


1.6           health and safety
              see also page 25 of this annual report
              manifesto commitment number 5: “strive for zero accidents together”

1.6.1         general health and safety policy
              achieving zero accidents remains vinci’s priority and all employees are working to that end. the goal, reiterated in vinci’s new manifesto,
              applies not only to vinci employees, but also to temporary staff and anyone else working on a vinci site, including the employees of joint
              contractors and subcontractors. the group encourages and supports its subcontractors and suppliers in this effort; it also shares its resources
              with them and involves them in safety actions. in five years, this approach has reduced the frequency of lost-time accidents by 23% and their
              severity by almost 7%.

              in 2012, the group put particular emphasis on staff from temporary employment agencies. the agencies were selected as partners in 2011
              through the negotiation of a framework contract covering the entire group in france. they were required to provide the first non-financial
              information attesting to their compliance with the efforts agreed upon and actually carried out vis-à-vis their personalised improvement plans
              provided by vinci. the resultant measures will be examined following the implementation of the contract in order to gauge the progress of
              each agency, notably with respect to health and safety.

              eurovia organised for the first time simulation exercises with france’s civil defence force, which intervenes in times of major disasters in france
              and the rest of the world. the six scenarios proposed sharply heightened employees’ awareness and provided the opportunity to assess the
              quality of the business line’s internal procedures.

              vinci autoroutes launched a “sécurité 100% chantiers” (100% worksite safety) programme with the goal of achieving zero accidents at all
              sites where it is in charge of works. a seminar at the end of september brought together some 60 occupational health and safety specialists
              to exchange their experiences in other business sectors and thereby bring change to practices.

              in the united kingdom, all vinci plc employees participated in a “take a break for safety” day to discuss and identify innovative solutions
              between the group’s various business units.

              vinci construction france also organised at all its worksites a safety day involving more than 18,000 employees on 1,763 sites. over 400
              senior managers participated in 23 theme-based events in 2012 in order to promote cross-business sharing of know-how and best
              practices.

1.6.2         health and safety of vinci employees
              the main objectives of the group’s health and safety policy are to anticipate and prevent occupational health and safety hazards (including
              psychosocial risks and harassment); to ensure the quality of hygiene, health, safety and living conditions in the workplace; and to redeploy
              employees who have suffered an occupational accident or illness.

              vinci’s health and safety policy is led by a coordination system that includes all the health and safety coordinators in the group’s business
              lines and divisions worldwide. its aim is to foster the sharing of best practices, improve the reliability of health and safety indicators, and
              examine new ways of enhancing performance in keeping with the specific situation of each business activity. the establishment of a policy
              for managing near accidents at eurovia and the exemplary no accidents day at vinci construction france were among the highlights of 2012.

              actions to promote health and safety include substance-abuse awareness, training and employee support campaigns; ergonomic studies of
              workstations; equipment adaptation and mechanisation; improvements to worksite organisation; and employee training to prevent muscu-
              loskeletal disorders and other occupational illnesses.

1.6.3   health and safety of temporary staff
        as an absolute priority for vinci, the “zero accident” policy also applies to temporary staff. under the terms of framework agreements, tem-
        porary employment agencies participate directly in the group’s health and safety policy. these agencies were selected on the basis of criteria
        including the health and safety of temporary staff, and they implement improvement plans.

        the substantial difference between the accident frequency rates of vinci employees and temporary staff reflects differences in the jobs
        performed, in technical know-how and experience, and in safety awareness and culture. reports on work accidents involving temporary staff
        enable concrete action to be taken to prevent them from recurring. these measures reduced the accident frequency rate of temporary staff
        in vinci companies in france by 4.3% in 2012 compared with 2011.

1.6.4         subcontractor health and safety
              subcontracting accounted for €7.46 billion in 2012, around 19% of revenue. in vinci’s business lines, subcontracting is multifaceted with a
              diversity of levels, and some vinci companies also act as subcontractors. under such complex circumstances, many vinci companies have
              signed framework contracts with their subcontractors. the “zero accident” policy is in all of these contracts and arrangements. special clauses
              covering accident prevention require, for example, that personal protective equipment be worn, work accidents reported and any change in
              work hazards notified.

              in a separate initiative, cofiroute has prepared a guidebook of best safety practices for its subcontractors. the asf group has set up a “con-
              tractor zero accident” policy that sets out 10 rules to be followed from design to operations in order to enhance h&s monitoring at the worksites
              they manage. at vinci plc, step-up training has helped heighten the awareness of more than 2,000 british employees and made it possible
              to reduce accident frequency 40% since 2010. this tool is also used with 40 group subcontractors.


1.6.5         health and safety agreements
              as part of its health and safety policy, vinci negotiates and enters into specific agreements with trade unions and employee representatives
              on subjects related to improving staff working conditions, thereby enhancing the overall performance of group companies. one of the main
              subjects of collective bargaining in 2011 was the prevention of factors that make work more arduous, with the aim of optimising working
              conditions in vinci businesses.

              manifesto commitment number 7: “promote sustainable careers together”


1.7.1         general training policy
              the group is pursuing its goal of offering career and personal development opportunities to all its 192,701 þ employees to develop in each
              of its markets the professional know-how and personal life skills to best respond to clients’ needs and be their best partner. given its decen-
              tralised organisation and determination to generate synergies in its business activities, skills development is concentrated in two areas. each
              business line has set up internal training centres adapted to its businesses and needs:
              ˇˇ the cesame centres (vinci construction);
              ˇˇ the vinci energies academy, which absorbed cegelec group university;
              ˇˇ the road industry training centre (eurovia), one of whose sites celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2012;
              ˇˇ the vinci park school (vinci concessions), and parcours asf and cofiroute campus (vinci autoroutes).


              training reflects actual operations in the group’s various countries as closely as possible. in international operations during 2012,
              vinci construction grands projets opened three new “worksite schools”: in chile (the el teniente mine); in malaysia (the berjaya central park
              in kuala lumpur); and in turkmenistan (government headquarters). soletanche freyssinet initiated training for project managers with the aim
              of developing international standards in the management of specialised civil engineering projects, be it in safety, quality or profitability. more
              than 120 interns from some 15 countries have already followed this programme, which will include 400 engineers representing 30 nationalities
              between now and 2014. the vinci energies academy has established a dozen training programmes in brazil, all led by local trainers.

              in addition to training centres for specific business lines or divisions, the vinci academy provides training to executives in order to support
              the group’s international development and promote synergies. a club has also been set up to give training centre managers an opportunity
              to share experiences and pool resources. additional e-learning sites were opened in 2012 at soletanche-bachy, freyssinet, vinci construction
              terrassement, vinci construction uk and vinci airports, following the establishment of those of the vinci academy, vinci energies academy,
              and of the training centres of eurovia and vinci construction france in fourth quarter 2011 on a shared platform.

              vinci has maintained its proactive policy regarding work-study programmes by signing a “charter in favour of training through work-study
              programmes” with france’s ministry for apprenticeships and professional training. by signing this charter, vinci made nine commitments: to
              increase the number of young people on work-study programmes; to promote their integration into the workforce; to involve staff to enhance
              the image of work-study programmes; to develop mentoring; to reduce drop-out rates from work-study programmes; to involve higher educa-

1.7.2   training initiatives
        in 2012, an average of 16 hours of training per employee was provided within the group, with managers receiving 20 hours and non-managers
        15. almost €167 million was spent on training in 2012; 3 million hours of training (up 7% relative to 2011) were devoted to technical and health
        and safety matters. in 2012, environment training increased almost 5%, and diversity training more than 45%. vinci’s goal is to foster the
        professional development of all its employees by providing each of them with personalised training. this goal was confirmed in 2012, when
        116,484 þ employees received training.

        more than 5,500 young people received training under work-study programmes within vinci in 2012. the group especially encourages
        handing on expertise from one generation to the next, particularly through mentoring. at vinci construction france, 300 highly experienced
        and skilled workers, site managers, team managers and engineers (a 20% increase from 2011) have acquired “master builder” status and are
        committed to passing on their knowledge. at asf, 399 in-house trainers, of which seven technical safety trainers and 79 mentors, provide
        training.


1.8     equality and diversity
        see also page 26 of this annual report
        manifesto commitment number 6: “foster equality and diversity together”

1.8.1   general policy for promoting diversity and preventing discrimination
        in this area, vinci is pursuing the pioneering policy it adopted in 2004, which is based on preventing any type of discrimination in its hiring,
        training, promotion and remuneration of employees and in their working conditions, as well as ensuring equality for everyone, with a special
        focus on gender equality, people with disabilities, people from an immigrant background and people over the age of 50.

        in a speech before 180 executives, operational managers and human resource managers from many group countries, at the in-house diversity
        day on 5 april 2012, the group’s chairman and chief executive officer reiterated his convictions and vinci’s commitment and priorities to
        diversity. the heads of the group’s business units, backed by the comments and experiences from four other major companies, led discussions
        about the day’s key point, the sharing of best practices.

        for the second year in a row, diversity was the second main topic of dialogue between management and labour. the number of collective
        agreements signed on diversity and equality more than doubled, rising from 43 in 2010 and 100 in 2011 to 163 in 2012, amounting to 12% of
        all agreements.

        self-diagnosis and audits
        vinci’s sustainable development self-diagnosis method, advance, makes it possible for the management bodies of group companies to
        assess their performance and establish a shared diagnosis of efforts to promote diversity and prevent discrimination (among other things). it
        enables entities to identify their weak points and establish their own improvement plan. the results of the various 2012 self-diagnoses show
        that the overall drive to promote diversity has been launched, but that close and continuous tracking, backed by the use of management tools,
        is required.

   vinci 2012 annual report                                            report of the board of directors                                                                                         149




           the self-diagnoses are supplemented in the case of some subsidiaries by in-house audits or outside accreditations, enabling them to imple-
           ment their improvement plans. in 2012, for example, vinci plc was awarded the british investors in diversity (iid) award scale 2 (on a scale of 3).
           vinci plc is thus becoming one of the first construction firms in the uk to be recognised at this stage of maturity for its promotion of diversity,
           equality and inclusion. in france, fournié grospaud synerys of vinci energies was awarded diversity accreditation.

           diversity network
           in 2011, vinci set up a worldwide network of diversity coordinators and trainers, with the aim of implementing the group’s policy at the local
           level by strengthening links between vinci’s business activities and geographical areas and by promoting best practices. at the end of 2012,
           the network consisted of 75 people, most of whom are human resources managers and operational managers.

           each member of the network attended a three-day in-depth training course, covering both theory and practice. it included a review of dis-
           crimination concepts, the various dimensions of diversity, key factors for action and progress, ways to promote a diversity policy, and training
           skills. new tools are regularly created and provided to coordinators and trainers. for example, there is the “diversity booklet”, published in
           english and french, consisting of 250 best practices identified within the group, diversity self-assessments, quizzes and diversity newsletter.
           this booklet enables coordinators and operational managers to identify the steps towards successful diversity management.

           diversity training
           diversity training, included as part of the training programme for the group’s operational managers, continued, with 15,241 hours provided
           in 2012. furthermore, surveys of managers who had taken part in this programme showed that they had a better understanding of how ste-
           reotypes can influence their decisions.

           to make progress in this area, vinci is an active member of france’s managers for diversity (afmd), the corporate social responsibility moni-
           toring agency (orse), and the institut du mécénat de solidarité (ims). vinci frequently contributes to public discussions on this subject.

1.8.2      measures to promote gender equality
           vinci has the objective of achieving a significant improvement in its gender mix. in particular, it intends to increase the proportion of women
           in managerial roles to 20% by 2015, from 16.4% in 2012. a plan of action was prepared in 2012, addressing vinci’s attractiveness and recruit-
           ment methods, as well as its career development opportunities.

           to enhance the appeal of group business lines, vinci continues to participate in the “capital filles” programme, which provides mentoring
           to young female students in disadvantaged areas. the programme also encourages apprenticeships, enabling these students to discover and
           learn about businesses of the future, as well as scientific and technical roles traditionally filled by men. in 2012, vinci boasted 65 mentors
           between the companies of vinci construction france and eurovia, helping schoolgirls in nine school districts in france.

           a second programme was established in 2012 in order to increase the group’s appeal among higher education students: vinci set up a
           network of group ambassadors and staff, mainly engineers, with the aim of promoting business lines by talking to students about their own
           career paths, mainly in engineering schools, during meetings or discussion conferences, on or off campus. the network, which is poised for
           expansion, counted 24 ambassadors in its first year.

1.8.3      measures to promote the employment and social integration of disabled people
           the group’s strategy has two main strands: the redeployment of staff no longer able to perform their current roles and the hiring of disabled
           people. there is a further strand in france, i.e. increasing the use of companies and non-profit organisations that specifically employ people
           with disabilities.

           in meeting vinci’s commitments, the various business lines adopt strategies appropriate to their organisations. the commitment of vinci
           subsidiaries to redeploy staff who become unable to perform their current roles resulted in the creation of trajeo’h in 2008. trajeo’h is a non-
           profit entity that operates across numerous vinci companies. its tasks are to keep these staff in employment and to support group companies
           with disability issues. trajeo’h was initially set up in the rhône-alps region, before moving into the greater paris region in 2010, to south-east
           france in 2011 and to normandy in 2012. the entity is financed by vinci’s local subsidiaries, and is also supported by the group’s business
           lines. in 2012, trajeo’h’s regional entities carried out 173 initial assessments and provided support to 142 vinci employees.

        the group purchasing coordination unit has responsibility for the strategy of using companies and non-profit organisations that specifically
        employ disabled people. this unit acts on the group’s wish to increase the amount of work subcontracted to such companies and organisa-
        tions, as discussed on page 164, in paragraph 3.3.2 “managing relations with suppliers”.

2.      environment
2.1     general environmental policy: together for green growth
        see also page 23 of this annual report
        manifesto commitment number 3: “promote green growth together”

2.1.1   environmental organisation
        the implementation of vinci’s environmental policy, “promote green growth together”, is built on senior management’s commitment, the
        empowerment of all operational staff within group companies and open dialogue with public authorities and environmental protection
        organisations. to manage environmental risks, operational departments rely on a network of over 500 correspondents who ensure that envi-
        ronmental policy guidelines are observed on the ground. these correspondents work in environment, sustainable development and technical
        departments, coordinating and ensuring the application of vinci’s environmental policy in all aspects of day-to-day work. the group’s
        delegation for sustainable development oversees this network, organises technical working groups comprising experts from each business
        line and coordinates the group’s environmental actions, such as the biodiversity task force, a working group on waste management, the cities
        and regions pivot club, and the “grand paris” club. the sustainable development self-diagnosis questionnaire, advance, is used by all group
        companies. based on the iso 26000 concept, it enables each subsidiary’s management committee to check progress and validate its envi-
        ronmental action plan.

2.1.2   environmental reporting coverage and scope
        vinci’s environmental reporting system deals with all of the themes listed in article 225 of france’s grenelle ii environment law. it uses the
        group’s common financial and social reporting method and is based on guidelines that are modelled on those of the global reporting initiative
        (gri) and adapted to the group’s activities. it covers nearly all of the group’s companies and uses around 60 quantitative indicators for meas-
        uring performance against key environmental parameters such as the consumption of resources and energy, greenhouse gas emissions, waste
        and recycling, certification, training, environmental incidents and environmental risk provisions. environmental reports are prepared using
        updated methodological guidebooks and procedures that are available on the group’s intranet. the methodological note on page 166 presents
        a list of these guidebooks and procedures. in 2012, vinci paid particularly close attention to regulatory developments so that it could comply
        with new legislation as soon as it came into force.

           vinci broadened the scope of its environmental reporting further in 2012. the increase compared with 2011 corresponds to an additional
           €2.4 billion of revenue covered (up 7%), due mainly to the inclusion of vinci construction’s international entities and vinci airports.
           environmental reporting coverage increased further in 2012 to 95% of total revenue generated by companies in the new scope. the remaining
           5% corresponds to short-term projects outside france, which are monitored at each worksite but not consolidated at group level.

           vinci’s statutory auditors have been reviewing the group’s social and environmental reporting system for the past 10 years. although con-
           siderable progress has been made over this period, there is room for further improvement, particularly in the number of indicators and scope
           of application. in 2012, the report of the statutory auditors expresses limited assurance on a certain number of environmental indicators for
           the vinci group. the indicators are identified by the symbol þ. the statutory auditors carried out interviews and surveys on the application
           of the guidelines at the following subsidiaries: vinci construction grands projets, eurovia, vinci autoroutes (asf), vinci construction france,
           vinci energies france, vinci energies international and vinci plc (uk), i.e. at least one entity from each vinci business line. environmental
           data is presented in compliance with decree no. 2012-557 of 24  april 2012 on companies’ disclosure requirements for social and environ-
           mental data, in application of article 225 of france’s grenelle ii environment law of 12 july 2010.

           having been one of the first companies in france to support voluntary audits of its data, vinci is continuing its efforts to increase transparency
           with respect to stakeholders and make this an important element in assessing its performance. the figures presented in this report are con-
           solidated using the same method as vinci's financial data, with the exception of some vinci construction grands projets and cfe entities,
           in particular qdvc and deme, which are still consolidated on the basis of vinci’s shareholding.

2.1.3      environmental training
           all vinci companies make efforts to raise awareness of environmental issues. despite a 5% fall from 2011 to 2012, environmental training
           hours have more than doubled in the space of five years (up 111%).
           environmental training was increasingly incorporated into existing courses (works, studies, operations, etc.) in 2012. awareness is proactively
           promoted at worksites (including subcontractors) with the 15-minute environment sessions. this initiative has been rolled out across all
           activities in the contracting business in france and is being developed abroad. environmental training is systematically provided at the
           entrepose contracting and vinci construction grands projets worksites. additional training sessions on energy performance, environmental
           certification (breeam, leed) and the eco-design of buildings and neighbourhoods were provided to meet market expectations in the sustain-
           able city sector.

2.1.4      preventing environmental incidents
           each group entity prepares and updates environmental incident prevention plans that address its specific environmental risks. the most
           significant projects undergo a preliminary analysis of environmental risks, which serves to determine the equipment and procedures required
           to prevent or mitigate any such risks. specific documents and equipment are provided to help prepare for and respond to emergency situa-
           tions. at vinci construction france, for example, engineering and design departments, construction managers and skilled site workers receive
           environmental risk prevention training tailored to the specific features of their activities. the training covers both regulations and the sharing
           of best practices.

           in 2012, vinci or its subcontractors were involved in six major environmental incidents (eight in 2011). a major incident is defined as one that
           creates extensive pollution requiring clean-up by external specialists and has consequences stretching beyond the entity’s responsibility.
           three of the incidents resulted in water pollution, two in soil pollution and one in the spillage of hazardous materials on a road in the united
           kingdom. they were all handled in accordance with applicable regulations.

2.1.5      environmental certification
           vinci encourages its companies to obtain iso 14001 or similar environmental certification to confirm and improve the effectiveness of their
           environmental management system. companies in the contracting business lines continued their efforts in this area in 2012; change – includ-
           ing in the integration of new companies and the development of new business activities, for example – is analysed over several years. significant
           progress was also made towards iso 14001 certification of operational activities, particularly at vinci autoroutes, which has had all its
           motorways certified as part of its eco-motorway programme, and at vinci facilities as part of its green facilities offering.

        at vinci immobilier, all new residential property development projects comprise low-energy buildings associated with environmental accredi-
        tations such as hqe, h&e and hpe, or energy-positive buildings such as the amplia residence, a 66-unit programme located in the lyon
        confluence district. vinci companies have acquired substantial expertise in meeting a variety of environmental standards, including hqe,
        breeam and leed. in 2012, vinci plc delivered the bbc studio complex, the first project of its kind to achieve an “outstanding” rating by
        breeam (the highest assessment rating). meanwhile, vinci energies entities have developed an hqe exploitation service, which has already
        been implemented in about 30 of the buildings they manage. a growing number of group companies have initiated iso 26000 certification
        programmes.

2.2     conserving resources
2.2.1   protecting water resources
        in answering the cdp water disclosure questionnaire for the first time in 2012, vinci joined the group of 191 companies worldwide that
        fulfilled the information request. the group’s water strategy is based on its environmental policy: to include water consumption and pollution
        prevention in risk analyses, to measure and reduce water consumption resulting from its business activities and products, and to protect water
        environments and ecosystems. vinci has created an international hydraulic engineering activity pivot club to identify expertise and design
        new, specific offerings.

        group companies monitor water resources particularly carefully. subsidiaries have adopted a number of specific initiatives to reduce water
        consumption. programmes to repair leaking pipes are also being deployed on the entire vinci autoroutes network. of all the vinci motorways
        in service, 72% have been equipped with water protection systems, involving either natural protection or structures that address potential
        problems. the policy for protecting water resources was strengthened by the adoption of the green motorway package in 2010.

        vinci plc monitors monthly water consumption on each project with the aim of reducing the volume used. vinci construction has introduced
        a wastewater recycling policy in france. some 60 concrete mixer washing stations have already been installed on worksites, leading to large
        reductions in water consumption.

        tools developed through the partnership with the chair in eco-design enable the water footprint of specific neighbourhoods to be assessed
        in detail, with particular emphasis given to soil permeability, rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment. some subsidiaries are creating
        specific processes for treating water pollution. entrepose contracting has designed notil, a net used to tow up to 10 tonnes of hydrocarbons
        in the event of an oil spill. water management is also essential in the design and construction of eco-neighbourhoods.

           vinci is gradually increasing the accuracy of its reporting on water consumption, despite the diversity of its activities. the increase in the
           concessions business water consumption is due to the expansion of the scope covered. the 22% fall in water consumption at eurovia and the
           37% fall at vinci construction are due to the efforts made to decrease consumption. the extent of these reductions is also due to the wide
           variety of the types of project carried out in the contracting business from one year to the next.

           measuring water consumption remains very complex. by way of an example, earthworks activities use water mainly for hosing down work
           areas to reduce the amount of dust produced during works. in africa, water is often pumped from generators installed near villages simply to
           provide the communities with water. the water itself undergoes no transformation whatsoever. it either evaporates or runs back to the water
           table without being polluted. water consumption is measured based on the fuel consumption of generators. many businesses use water in
           this way. responding to the cdp water disclosure questionnaire is thus a sign of the maturity of vinci companies.

2.2.2      raw materials
           in the contracting business, raw materials purchasing is decentralised, with purchases monitored on a project-by-project basis and not con-
           solidated at group level. efforts focus on purchasing recycled materials of equivalent performance, recycling waste (see paragraph 2.2.8) and
           sourcing local products. there is also a focus on designing products that use fewer raw materials. the group’s eco-design approach is used
           by vinci construction france for developing housing, offices, student accommodation and other projects. in housing, the habitat colonne
           procedure, used to build about 500 homes in 2012, reduces raw materials consumption by 20%.

           in the concessions business, consumption of the main raw materials is monitored and consolidated. in 2012, 1,571,018 tonnes of coating
           were used and 34,902 tonnes þ of de-icing salt were purchased (48,386 tonnes þ in 2011).

           the wood-related businesses of vinci construction france, under the brand arbonis, generated revenue of €65 million in 2012, up 62% on
           2010.

           in 2012, to gain a better understanding of the environmental impact of raw materials, vinci collaborated with professional groups to prepare
           life cycle inventories (lci) of its materials. the group also played an active role in discussions at the french government’s environmental
           conference. through the partnership with the chair in eco-design, post-doctoral research was used to apply european environmental data
           on the steel and wood used in construction to the construction practices in france based on the diogen database of civil engineering impact
           data. as a member of the ecosd network that promotes expertise in eco-design, vinci has begun an initiative to compile a french environ-
           mental database devoted to the construction sector. vinci also participates in inter-industry working groups, such as the infrastructure
           committee of france’s energy, environment and transport observatory (oeet) and the gt41 working group of the french underground tunnel
           association (aftes). soletanche bachy is contributing to gt41 efforts to develop a life cycle assessment-based methodology for assessing
           and comparing underground structure building methods, estimating the impact of materials used, making design and construction adjust-
           ments and comparing technical solutions.

2.2.3      energy consumption
           in 2012, the group continued to focus on the actual performance of its activities and offers. the measurement of energy consumption result-
           ing from vinci’s activities (worksite equipment, vehicles, infrastructure assets under concession, etc.) was audited at group level by the
           statutory auditors, who expressed a limited level of assurance in the figures.

           in france, the 2012 thermal regulations form a major part of the grenelle environment legislation and seek to encourage low-energy buildings.
           the regulations came into force in 2011 for some projects (commercial buildings and housing in urban renewal areas). to meet the new
           requirements while maintaining costs, vinci is developing new systems in both the commercial and housing sectors, drawing on vinci
           construction’s expertise to minimise energy losses through the building shell and vinci energies’ to install innovative equipment such as all
           air heating. vinci is playing a part in preparing the future 2020 thermal regulations, which will consider the building sustainability as a whole,
           and not merely in terms of energy. current work is focused on building use and the calculation of overall multi-criteria performance. with its
           oxygen eco-commitment, vinci construction france guarantees the energy performance of both the new and refurbished buildings it delivers
           and provides ways for occupants to optimise their energy use. in 2012, 18 oxygen projects were under development.

           vinci facilities (vinci energies) is using its expertise in areas such as energy diagnostics and audits, monitoring and optimisation work to
           develop diago energy efficiency contract solutions for its clients. these may involve various levels of service, from adjusting an energy supplier
           contract to performing major energy-related renovation work. in all cases, clients are guaranteed a certain level of energy savings. vinci
           facilities also uses its expertise to improve its own energy performance, monitoring and managing its energy consumption and raising staff
           awareness about saving energy. in 2012, energy performance was a major topic discussed in lectures given through the chair in eco-design,
           including during the seminar on 2 and 3 october on smart grids, and energy performance guarantee for refurbished buildings.

        for the reporting period, group energy consumption totalled 227 mwh per million of euros of revenue.

        due to the industrial nature of its business, eurovia continues to account for a large proportion of total energy consumption. the increase in
        activity at its lime plant and the inclusion of vinci airports in the reporting scope drove natural gas consumption up about 30% on 2011.
        deme (cfe subsidiary specialised in dredging) accounts for most of the heavy fuel oil consumption. electricity consumption, up 6% on 2011,
        did not rise as fast as the revenue of businesses covered by environmental reporting.

        eurovia was the first group business line to set up an ambitious energy and co2 reduction plan, including improvements to the energy efficiency
        of coating plants, quarry equipment and operations buildings. the group’s public works subsidiary is also developing processes that reduce
        energy consumption. for example, the tempera® warm mix process produces energy savings of 20-40%. eurovia’s target is to lay warm mix
        products on 50% of all its roads by 2015. at vinci construction, subsidiary arbonis specialises in wood-related activities. it sells sylvabox, a
        range of wood-framed bungalows featuring enhanced insulation that reduces energy consumption by 80%.

        (*) in 2011, the indicator takes into account diesel and heating oil.


        with an increase of 2.5%, the group’s total fuel consumption rose less than the revenue covered by environmental reporting (up 7%). this
        progress results from the continued training in eco-driving of passenger vehicles and trucks and eco-operation of heavy equipment in all of
        its subsidiaries, in particular at vinci construction terrassement and eurovia, where all heavy equipment operators in quarries have been
        trained. vehicles and equipment are also systematically replaced with more economical versions.

        in addition to in-house training, vinci autoroutes encourages customers to reduce their fuel consumption by organising eco-driving aware-
        ness campaigns at motorway rest areas and by developing offers that help make the best use of existing infrastructure. vinci autoroutes
        continued to promote car-pooling in 2012. located near toll stations, parking facilities make an easy meeting point for drivers and passengers,
        with nearly 1,000 parking spaces reserved for car-pooling in autumn 2012. vinci autoroutes also develops dynamic traffic management
        solutions by boosting the involvement of users on its roads: real-time information systems that help users save fuel, for example when looking
        for a parking space at a rest area. this topic was extensively developed at vinci’s 2012 research day on 29 february.

        through the chair in eco-design, research is being carried out into the eco-design of parking facilities. the ecole des ponts paristech, in
        partnership with vinci park, has modelled the balance between supply and demand for city parking in order to design solutions that minimise
        the time users spend looking for a space (more than 10% of current city traffic).

2.2.4   use of renewable energy
        in 2012, vinci companies purchased 4,489 mwh of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (2011: 4,385 mwh). vinci plc
        (vinci construction) fixed sites in the united kingdom buy almost all their electricity under renewable energy contracts.

           renewable energy-related activity is expanding. the contracting business companies have expertise in designing, supplying and installing
           photovoltaic panels. sonil, a vinci construction france subsidiary, specialises in integrating and installing solar panels. the company has com-
           pleted 30 projects totalling 7,000 m2 or 900 kwp. vinci energies business units also have expertise in building photovoltaic power plants.
           omexom energies renouvelables specialises in the design, contracting, grid access and operation of renewable energy projects. the company
           is building the 12 mwp photovoltaic farm in estezargues in the south of france, which features 10,000 m2 of sensors. vinci construction is
           developing technical solutions to industrialise construction and optimise the installation of onshore and offshore wind farms. this was the focus
           of the eolift research project, overseen by freyssinet and winner of the large-scale wind power call for interest launched by ademe in 2012.

           vinci autoroutes has 2,697 renewable energy devices (excluding heat pumps) generating solar, thermal and wind energy. as concerns the
           group’s vehicle fleet, various subsidiaries are currently testing hybrid and electric alternatives. in 2012, vinci facilities (vinci energies) intro-
           duced a car-sharing solution combining electric and thermal vehicles at its buc site in the greater paris area. vinci is a member of a group of
           major companies that has made a commitment to the public authorities to encourage and support the development and mass production of
           no-carbon vehicles.

2.2.5      land use
           to combat the loss of natural and agricultural resources and to maintain a balance between nature and human amenities, the group deals
           with land-use issues at a very early stage. efforts include research into biodiversity and urban agriculture as part of the chair in the eco-design
           of building complexes and infrastructure. integrating sites into their environment and land use are subjects of special concern for motorway
           concessions and for eurovia’s quarries. these entities have acquired special expertise in rehabilitation. this enables them to restore the bio-
           diversity of sites and make them an integral part of the local environment. for all infrastructure projects, and particularly for the tours–bordeaux
           south europe atlantic high-speed line project in 2012, the group worked with local communities and made commitments to the french
           government. the companies have appointed experts in landscaping and reliefs.

2.2.6      air pollution
           the vinci business lines most concerned with the problem of atmospheric emissions are vinci concessions, eurovia and vinci construction.
           in concessions, atmospheric emissions were monitored at a sample of 272 vinci park, vinci airports and vinci autoroutes car parks. this
           revealed that most emissions are generated by users (cars, aircraft, etc.).

2.2.7      noise pollution
           all vinci projects are subject to a preliminary noise study to limit the noise generated by urban construction sites, motorway traffic and so
           forth. soletanche freyssinet subsidiary soldata specialises in noise management. in 2012, it deployed ear-is, its software that analyses noise
           and vibration levels in real time and simulates them for construction projects and industrial activities. vinci companies systematically offer
           technical solutions during the construction phase, including changing a motorway route, erecting noise barriers and embankments, and using
           special low-noise road surfacing materials such as eurovia’s viaphone®.

           noise levels on motorways in france are measured regularly to enable vinci’s motorway concession companies to identify and reduce noise
           black spots. homes may then be protected using noise insulation in their facades, or noise barriers or embankments planted with shrubs or
           trees. as part of the green motorway package, vinci autoroutes has committed to providing noise protection to 1,000 homes identified as
           noise black spots between 2010 and 2012. in 2012, 662 homes þ were protected, making a total of 1,141 since 2010. studies and administra-
           tive work were conducted in 2010, with most of the noise-prevention work carried out in 2011 and 2012.

2.2.8      waste management and recycling
           vinci’s general policy is based on a circular economy model and focuses on three aims: producing less waste at the source; waste sorting and
           traceability; and recovering waste to use as a resource. this policy is closely associated with the eco-design strategy used in vinci’s products
           and services. waste management is important to both contracting entities – which deal mainly with construction site waste – and concessions
           entities, which have to dispose of their customers’ waste (car parks, motorways, etc.).

           the group’s contracting companies implement waste management plans at their worksites in accordance with local requirements. in the uk,
           vinci companies have joined the national effort to halve the quantity of landfilled waste between 2005 and 2012. in 2012, vinci plc produced
           1,251,146 tonnes þ of waste, of which over 98% þ was recycled, reused or recovered, a significant improvement on 2011 (up 80%þ). vinci
           energies business units also monitor their waste closely, including paper waste, which totalled 1,057 tonnes in 2011. in 2012, these business
           units produced 172,078 tonnes of inert waste, 13,501 tonnes of non-hazardous waste and 672 tonnes of hazardous waste.

           recycling has been a priority at eurovia for some 20 years and there is a veritable boom in the development of innovative products and pro-
           cesses that use smaller amounts of natural resources and energy. eurovia now has 130 facilities that recycle most of the waste produced by
           its worksites. in 2012, eurovia set itself the target of exceeding 20% of recycled mix aggregate in its total amount of mix. the percentage is
           being checked by the statutory auditors and has increased by 12.5% over 2011, making eurovia europe’s market leader in this field.

        as part of the green motorway package, 91% of the rest areas along vinci autoroutes motorways are equipped with sorting bins (39% in 2011
        and 21% in 2010). vinci autoroutes also runs regular awareness campaigns to encourage motorway users to sort their waste. once sorted,
        waste is delivered to recovery and treatment facilities; 52% of the waste produced by vinci autoroutes was recovered in 2012.

2.3     combating climate change
        greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced in order to combat climate disruption. in 2007, vinci initiated a proactive programme on this
        subject to anticipate, monitor and comply with legislation in the most advanced countries. the impact of current carbon emissions regulations
        on vinci’s activities is mainly indirect. vinci has only one facility that is subject to the european emissions trading scheme’s national allocation
        plan (see page 124) and must comply with the carbon reduction commitment in the united kingdom. vinci autoroutes has undertaken a
        study of how carbon reduction measures affect its activities. new regulations are opening up opportunities for vinci, whose companies now
        offer their customers climate-friendly solutions that enable them to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. vinci committed to green
        growth in 2012, with a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020. this target covers the group’s like-for-like co2 emissions
        and uses 2009 as its base year (the first year when coverage exceeded 90%). the group is also taking initiatives to reduce its clients’ energy
        consumption.

2.3.1   greenhouse gas emissions
        the methodology used to determine the greenhouse gas emissions of vinci’s businesses is based on the group’s environmental reporting
        data and measures iso 14064 scope 1 and 2 emissions. scope 1 includes direct emissions from the use of fossil fuels (fixed sites, worksites
        and company vehicles), as well as non-energy emissions (mainly from decarbonising limestone at eurovia’s lime plant). scope 2 includes indirect
        emissions produced to make energy (mainly electricity) purchased and used at fixed sites and for projects. overall, vinci’s co2 emissions in
        2012 amounted to 2.4 million tonnes. in 2012, 32 vinci subsidiaries applied article 75 of the grenelle ii environment law, which requires
        companies to perform greenhouse gas audits and define action plans to reduce them. the group’s emissions are determined using regulatory
        coefficients from the carbon database of ademe (france’s environment and energy management agency). the coefficients were applied to
        data from previous years and recalculated for a pro forma comparison.

              in 2012, the group’s direct emissions (scope 1 and 2) per million euros of revenue were stable in relation to 2011 at 62 tonnes of co2 eq. vinci’s
              carbon intensity has continued to decrease since 2009 (71 tonnes of co2 eq.) to stand at 13.3%.

              group companies have introduced ambitious policies to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions target by 2020. eurovia’s 2012-2015 policy
              aims to reduce its co2 emissions by 4% per year. in the uk, vinci construction has set a target to reduce emissions by 30% between now and
              2015.

              to broaden its range of low-co2 solutions, vinci is continuing to develop specific tools and carry out studies to better quantify and control
              greenhouse gas emissions resulting from its business (iso scope 1, 2 and 3).

              other levers for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are mainly to be found in how structures are used by clients and end-users: operation
              accounts for over 50% of lifetime emissions for a rail line, 90% for a building and over 95% for a motorway. reducing the co2 emissions of
              vinci structures is part of an eco-design approach that takes into account the construction, operation and end-of-life phases to compare
              and select the most appropriate technologies during the design phase. the approach uses life cycle assessment (lca) tools which, as well as
              co2 emissions, measure indicators such as water consumption, depletion of natural resources and impacts on human health. these tools allow
              the group to ensure that co2 reductions do not result in other impacts at any point in the life cycle of its structures. lca tools are developed
              within the framework of the chair in eco-design and are used in numerous subsidiaries. at vinci construction france and soletanche bachy,
              eco-design studies were carried out on 229 projects in 2012. eurovia also carries out lca on its new materials. the co2ncerned methodol-
              ogy developed by vinci to measure a project’s carbon footprint is deployed across all group business lines: to assess construction options
              at vinci construction, the effectiveness of solutions at vinci energies and motorway routes at vinci concessions. since 2012, it is also used
              to optimise the carbon footprint of rail infrastructure.

              vinci is an active member of national and international working groups within its industry (association bilan carbone and encord) that are
              defining standards for quantifying scope 3 emissions. under this approach, success depends on relationships with end-customers, which is
              why vinci autoroutes encourages motorists to drive less aggressively and to use the eco-comparison tool on its website to calculate the
              amount of co2 they could avoid emitting. vinci construction shows building occupants how they can consume less energy through its oxygen
              eco-commitment (23 projects considered in 2012, 18 under way). the first oxygen building delivered was the ensta campus at the ecole
              polytechnique site in palaiseau. its solution, which combines geothermal energy and solar panels, has reduced site emissions by 90% compared
              with a traditional natural gas system. vinci facilities (a vinci energies subsidiary) provides customers with innovative solutions for drastically
              reducing the carbon emissions of the buildings it manages.

              between 2011 and 2012, the co2 emissions of vinci autoroutes companies rose 1.7% to around 37,000 tonnes with the inclusion of the a86
              duplex in the environmental reporting scope. emissions by motorway customers fell 2.3% due to a decrease in heavy vehicle traffic and the
              deployment of 30 km/h electronic toll lanes. these no-stop lanes have lowered co2 emissions by 41,980 tonnes since 2011.

              investors have responded positively to the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions and actions taken to reduce them. in 2012, for the sixth
              year running, vinci confirmed its leadership position in france regarding climate strategy by obtaining the carbon disclosure project’s highest
              rating (80/100, level c) among its peers in the construction and public works category. the carbon disclosure project, which is conducted on
              behalf of 655 investors, assesses how the world’s 500 largest companies by market capitalisation are responding to climate change.


2.3.2         adapting to climate change
              vinci has adopted france’s plan for adjusting to climate change and takes a forward-looking approach to the issue. the group plans in advance
              for any necessary changes to cities and buildings, particularly in eco-design projects in which studies span the structure’s whole life cycle.
              similarly, vinci companies have taken into account the scientific data predicting a 50 cm rise in sea levels by 2050. although they cannot take
              action regarding political strategy on receding coastlines, they are developing expertise in technical improvements, notably to strengthen
              barriers.

              vinci plays a central role in making new and existing structures more resistant to extreme weather events, ensuring long-term durability and
              providing innovative construction solutions. it carries out extensive research, both internally and through its partnership with the chair in the
              eco-design of building complexes and infrastructure. in response to the scarce funding available to public clients and the uncertainty about
              new financing partnership models, vinci concessions supports the economics chair of public-private partnerships to develop knowledge in
              these areas.


2.4           conserving biodiversity
2.4.1         vinci’s approach to biodiversity
              vinci strengthened its biodiversity strategy substantially in 2012, turning its biodiversity working group into a biodiversity task force. the
              15-strong team combines the group’s ecology experts with the environment managers from its different activities and is primarily responsible
              for monitoring the regulatory environment, developing scientific expertise, analysing risks, promoting initiatives and sharing best practices.
              the unit also encourages organisations, engineering and design departments, and companies to discuss their approaches and tools. these
              insightful exchanges are held under the banner of the “working together” programme.

158                                                          report of the board of directors




        the group drew on the expertise of the biodiversity task force in its response to the call for recognition from the ministry of ecology, sustainable
        development and energy by joining the stratégie nationale pour la biodiversité (snb, national biodiversity strategy). vinci’s proactive com-
        mitment to promoting biodiversity was officially recognised in late 2012. the snb’s recognition acts as a guarantee of the quality and consist-
        ency of its 2012-2015 biodiversity programme, which entails group-wide initiatives designed to:
        ˇˇ pool and build knowledge on biodiversity;
        ˇˇ share best practices;
        ˇˇ train and raise the awareness of all staff members about biodiversity;
        ˇˇ develop new solutions to better integrate biodiversity issues in all aspects of day-to-day work.


        eurovia also received snb recognition for its proactive commitment, which includes a three-year partnership with the natural heritage depart-
        ment of mnhn, france’s national museum of natural history. the mnhn will guide eurovia in the implementation and supervision of its
        snb project: evaluation and monitoring of the general action plan, assessment and audits of specific sites, definition of biodiversity indicators,
        training and awareness. in exchange, eurovia will provide its partner with sites for study in order to develop its knowledge on biodiversity
        (inventory, comparative analyses of changing environments, monitoring of the performance of structures and ecological redevelopment, etc.).

2.4.2   measures taken to promote biodiversity
        several group companies operating on long cycles and directly impacting natural environments – notably those involved in the concession-
        construction of transport infrastructure (motorways, airports), earthworks and quarries – have been looking at the issue of biodiversity for
        many years. measures to avoid and reduce impacts on natural environments and to offset residual effects have been developed and applied
        in partnership with the stakeholders most affected, depending on the project, location, species and ecosystem.

        motorway concession operators are primarily concerned with the fragmentation of natural habitats, essentially focusing their efforts on the
        transparency of infrastructure, the reversibility of barriers and the restoration of ecological connectivity. this includes creating environmental
        engineering structures, re-profiling ponds, making improvements to hydraulic structures, restoring and enhancing sites of ecological interest,
        redeveloping slopes, sustainable roadside grass mowing, and so on. one of the emblematic accomplishments in 2012 was the construction
        of two bat bridges on the a89 worksite in partnership with the rhône-alpes federation of organisations for the protection of nature (frapna).
        these structures allow bats to use echolocation to navigate over the motorway without the risk of collision. other initiatives have been taken
        such as combating invasive species, reducing the use of plant protection products and raising public awareness at rest areas.

        along with the initiatives led by vinci autoroutes companies, 120 measures have been taken in application of the biodiversity guidelines in
        the green motorway package. once the points of conflict between natural ecological connectivity and motorway infrastructure had been
        identified, the programme enabled a number of improvements to be made:
        ˇˇ construction of environment-friendly crossings for large animals, underpasses for smaller wildlife, escape areas for wild boar and ramps for
        deer and similar species;
        ˇˇ biodiversity management plans implemented at sites of ecological interest near motorways;
        ˇˇ creation of protective and community-based orchards and olive groves, etc.


        the main issue faced by eurovia is restoring sites throughout the life cycle of its quarries, notably in order to conserve and provide a favourable
        environment for new plant and animal species. the company defines and monitors its measures with the help of local environmental organisa-
        tions. in france, some eurovia sites have signed formal partnership agreements with these organisations and 72% of its quarries have joined
        the unicem environment charter.

        in our construction activities and particularly during the earthworks phases, protecting biodiversity at worksites is a highly relevant issue. for
        example, in 2012 special “biodiversity” signs were put up at 127 vinci construction terrassement worksites. at the south europe atlantic
        high-speed rail line worksite, 650 signs and 1,750 pictograms are being installed. emphasis is also placed on ecological engineering, focusing
        on in-house training and the sharing of best practices.

        lastly, conservation and improvement efforts are being made to protect and enhance natural assets along the entire south europe atlantic
        high-speed line (sea). to that end, vinci set up the lisea biodiversity foundation at the end of 2012. with €5 million funding for the period
        2012-2017, the foundation will help to finance local projects submitted by non-profit organisations, companies or research centres located
        in any of the six french départements crossed by the rail line: indre et loire, vienne, deux sèvres, charente, charente maritime and gironde. to
        be eligible for financial assistance, projects must aim to:
        ˇˇ conserve species and strengthen populations;
        ˇˇ develop knowledge about species (population, habitat, behaviour);
        ˇˇ restore habitats or ecological connectivity;

        priority is given to projects that conserve the european mink, foster the recolonisation of little bustards on farmland and develop knowledge
        about bats. the initiatives supported are set apart from the commitments already made by lisea, cosea and rff, and are not included in the
        sea project’s regulatory and ecological offsetting measures.

2.5           preservation and restoration
2.5.1         legal and regulatory compliance
              as regards france’s grenelle ii environment law, vinci has a proactive approach to legal compliance. special it tools for managing regulatory
              and qhse risks are also used, such as vinci energies’ préventéo®, which supports regulatory monitoring and the standardisation of criteria
              for the group’s regulatory audit. the group pools this expertise and environmental regulation monitoring efforts through cross-business
              working groups.

2.5.2         prevention of environmental impacts and associated costs
              expenditure on protecting the environment (e.g. soil remediation at soletanche bachy, cleaning and decontamination of structures at freyssinet
              and recovery of organic materials at vinci environnement) is generally included directly in each project’s operating expenses and is not
              consolidated centrally.

              between 2011 and 2012, the annual environmental expenditure of vinci autoroutes rose by 20%. this four-fold increase since 2010 is due
              mainly to the implementation of the green motorway package.

              see “environmental, industrial and technological risks”: page 120 of the report of the board of directors.


2.5.4	damages paid in 2012 following legal decisions on environmental matters and lawsuits filed for damage to
       the environment
              legal decisions regarding the environment are handled directly by the business units concerned and the amounts paid are not consolidated
              at group level. no vinci companies appear to have paid any damages in 2012 subsequent to a court decision on an environmental matter.



3.            social responsibility
              this chapter contains information about vinci’s social responsibility commitments.

              vinci’s social responsibility policy takes the form of various actions and programmes: the group’s impact on the areas where it operates, its
              relations with stakeholders, and sponsorship. as regards sponsorship, vinci’s companies focus on three main areas: employment and social
              integration through work, environment and research, and culture and heritage assets. in accordance with the group’s decentralised manage-
              ment model, vinci does not consolidate either its reporting on sponsorship actions or the total budget allocated. a low-range estimate suggest
              a total amount of about €10 million in 2012.


3.1           regional, economic and workforce-related impacts of vinci’s activities
              see also page 24 of this annual report
              manifesto commitment number 4: “engage in civic projects together”

              all jobs created by group companies, whether directly or indirectly through temporary employment and subcontracting, together with initia-
              tives undertaken to encourage the professional integration of people who have been unemployed for a long period, help to support regional
              development. in addition, public-private partnership agreements for the financing and operation of certain types of infrastructure over the
              medium and long term contribute to building strong and lasting relationships with local authorities. the group’s preferred governance approach,
              applied increasingly year on year for all major projects having a potential impact on the environment and quality of life for local communities,
              involves consultation with residents and environmental organisations.

3.1.1         contribution to employment, local skills development and professional integration
              employment and skills development
              vinci’s contracting activities (the energy, construction and roads business lines) are highly labour intensive and thus have a substantial direct and
              indirect impact on regional employment (see § 1.2 employment). the group’s general policy is to use local resources whenever possible. internationally,
              and particularly in emerging economies, vinci works to promote the development of local skills for both production and managerial staff.

              in africa, for example, sogea-satom has undertaken a long-term commitment to the professional development of african managers, enabling
              them to move into senior positions. with this aim in view, the company is supporting the development of local training structures and continues
              to strengthen its partnerships with the ecole polytechnique de dakar in senegal, the institut supérieur de technologies d’afrique centrale
              (istac) in cameroon and the institut international d’ingénierie de l’eau et de l’environnement (2ie) in burkina faso. in 2012, sogea-satom
              confirmed the hiring of 11 recent graduates selected by the company as beneficiaries of special support measures throughout their studies.
              it has lent similar assistance to a total of 19 students since the start of the 2012–13 academic year. under this initiative, some 50 young people
              have been subsidised by the company since its first partnership was launched in 2007 and 47 have been hired. currently, 50% of works engi-
              neers and works directors employed by sogea-satom are african.

              vinci construction grands projets has launched skill up, a programme that seeks to build the knowledge and competencies of workers and
              supervisors around the world by establishing local training centres close to the entity’s worksites. in 2012, 343 employees in turkmenistan,

160                                            report of the board of directors




      qatar, malaysia and chile received training under the skill up programme. of these, 60% had been hired directly at local level, with subcon-
      tractors accounting for the remainder.

      for its papua new guinea pipeline project, spiecapag, an entrepose contracting company (vinci construction), has hired 3,600 people since
      work began in 2010, 74% of whom are new guineans. special training programmes have been put in place for these new hires. since the
      launch of the project, 94,196 training hours have been delivered, with local trainees accounting for 69% of session participants.

      in france, favouring local employment whenever possible and local skills development are key aspects of the group’s policies. for the south europe
      atlantic high-speed rail line between tours and bordeaux (sea hsl), the construction joint venture cosea has entered into a partnership with
      stakeholders in the poitou charentes region, the french state, regional authorities, state-run job centres, chambers of commerce and trade asso-
      ciations. a charter has been signed by all these parties formally recognising the project’s commitment to local employment, sustainable employability,
      secure career paths and the reinforcement of local know-how. between the launch of the project and year-end 2012, close to 1,000 people had
      been hired locally, two-thirds of whom were people excluded from the labour market (i.e. among those targeted by professional integration meas-
      ures). the recruiters also focused on opening up these business activities to women, who made up 10% of the machine operators trained in 2012.
      to serve local hires, nine training structures have been established along the route of the future rail line (four specialising in civil engineering and
      five in earthworks), with the aim of gaining a lasting foothold in the region, which is necessary to ensure the long-term viability of this initiative.

      professional integration
      since its creation, vinci and its subsidiaries have worked to develop a number of initiatives to fight social exclusion and help the long-term
      unemployed and other disadvantaged people find jobs. in 2012, xavier huillard, chairman and ceo of vinci, signed the pacte pour l’insertion
      et l’emploi launched by the comité national des entreprises d’insertion (cnei), thereby reaffirming the group’s formal commitments in this
      area. the aim of this initiative is to encourage all stakeholders to support the development of companies established specifically to promote
      social integration, taking as its goals a threefold increase in the number of people served by social integration structures and bring populations
      back into the workforce over the long term.

      the development of the vie social integration entity continued in 2012. launched in 2011 at the initiative of the group’s executive management,
      this new subsidiary provides innovative and effective solutions to group companies that want to address the workforce-related demands
      stipulated in the social integration clauses of their contracts. unprecedented in france, this structure aims to support long-term social inte-
      gration by providing assistance to group companies on a day-to-day basis. another role is to establish professional relations with socially
      responsible entities appointed by public authorities as their preferred contacts regarding social integration, and advising local government
      authorities about new services that meet business needs. in addition to serving group companies, vie adopts a cohesive approach to getting
      socially excluded individuals squarely on the path to career development, organised around social integration through work, access to training
      and consideration of social issues faced by these populations, all the while helping them find permanent jobs.
      the vie structure is targeting controlled growth, with a gradual ramp-up of facilities throughout france. in 2012, vie’s offices in the paris region
      and northern france gained a firm footing while a new office was created in the south-western part of the country. for companies located
      outside these three regions, vie offers its assistance on an ad hoc basis. in 2012, the first full year of operation for the entity, group companies
      enlisted vie’s services for the administration and coordination of social integration in relation to 87 projects, corresponding to 1,350,000 hours
      of integration employment and involving more than 1,200 subcontractors. in all, 710 people benefited from social integration measures in
      2012, including 12% women and 2.8% workers with disabilities, corresponding to 343,000 hours of integration employment.

      vie also assists group companies with voluntary integration measures involving clauses added to supply contracts signed with service providers.
      along these lines, in 2012, escota became the first vinci company to include an integration clause in one of its ongoing maintenance contracts,
      requiring at least 5% of labour hours for brushwood clearing and tree felling to be performed by long-term unemployed individuals.

      vie’s integration coordinators participated in some 200 meetings with social and solidarity economy stakeholders and government officials
      in order to cooperate more effectively and improve the linkages between the various integration measures implemented throughout france.

      relations with educational institutions
      vinci companies have consistently recruited new staff for a number of years, even under challenging economic conditions, and maintain
      long-term partnerships with educational institutions and in the education field. the general policy is to enable all group companies to rely on
      vinci’s strong employer brand for their recruitment needs, whether in terms of volume or quality. a large number of partnerships are forged
      locally by group companies with apprenticeship centres, schools, universities and other institutions of higher learning. they involve the alloca-
      tion of the apprenticeship tax, supplemented by the strong involvement of employees in educational initiatives. apart from the usual short- and
      medium-term recruitment campaigns, specific efforts targeting young people are also pursued well in advance of recruitment, designed to
      introduce them to the group’s professions and help them discover career opportunities.

      in france, vinci is an active partner of the capital filles programme, bringing together six corporations and three government departments,
      whose aim is to assist young women from low-income backgrounds with their career plans. in 2012, 65 women employed by the group
      volunteered their time to visit secondary schools in disadvantaged urban areas across france to speak about technical occupations within
      vinci companies and mentor young female students. the group also takes part in ma caméra chez les pros, an introduction to vinci profes-
      sions geared towards middle school students. in addition, vinci actively supports “second chance” schools in france, serving educationally
      disadvantaged populations tending to be excluded from the labour market.

      the initial five-year cycle of the first chair in eco-design of building complexes and infrastructure, sponsored by vinci in conjunction with
      three prestigious paristech institutions (minesparistech, agroparistech and the ecole des ponts paristech), draws to a close at the end of 2013.
      the partnership, which has amounted to €600,000 a year, will be renewed, with further research, publications, classes and seminars as well
      as practical real-world applications planned for the next cycle, which will run from 2013 until 2017.

      fabrique de la cité, another recipient of vinci’s support, is a think tank dealing with urban issues, bringing together scientists, people from
      the corporate world and public-sector decision-makers. it develops partnerships with schools and universities. examples include the amur
      (urban development and programme management) master’s degree offered by ecole nationale des ponts et chaussées (enpc france) and
      the master’s degree in regional and urban development strategies offered by sciences po-paris. it also has a partnership with institut
      d’urbanisme de grenoble (iug).

3.1.2      contribution to regional development and impact on local populations
           by designing, financing, building and operating bridges, tunnels, roads and other infrastructure over the long term, all vinci companies are
           leading players in regional development, whether in rural or urban areas. as the group’s activities cannot be relocated, they give shape to the
           space where they are pursued, endowing it with greater coherence and fostering both economic and social development. through their strong
           local roots, group companies generate significant economic benefits, playing an important part in the life of surrounding communities, as
           much through construction as through concession activities, whether in the form of revenue, local tax contributions or support for local non-
           profits organisations and associations

           the group’s cité solidaire programme, for example, in collaboration with group companies, supports very small non-profit organisations
           working on community projects in underprivileged neighbourhoods. this programme invites proposals focusing on disadvantaged urban
           areas, supports small neighbourhood associations that act locally, and promotes commitments by group companies at local level to sponsor
           projects and offer communities the benefit of their employees’ expertise. following two pilot projects in 2010, the effectiveness of this approach
           was confirmed in 2011 in three french cities. in 2012, the programme was extended to four new cities in france: grenoble, le havre, rennes
           and champigny sur marne.

           the group’s concession companies are gradually putting in place means of assessing the economic activity and social impacts generated by
           the operation of major engineering structures.

           as an example of this type of initiative, the group sponsored two studies analysing the socioeconomic impact of the rion–antirion bridge in
           greece carried out by researchers at the university of patras; the first study covered the investment and construction period (1997–2004) and
           the other covered the operation of this facility between 2004 and 2006. these two studies found that there was a 3% increase in the number
           of jobs, an initial 25% increase in traffic followed by a 13% increase, a 30% jump in property prices in the northern region during the first period
           and a 10% rise in the number of companies setting up operations in the region during the second period. the second study also concluded
           that the bridge has had a positive impact on accessibility in the adjoining regions and has helped reduce economic disparities, while also limit-
           ing social exclusion in the areas to the north of the bridge and furthering the development of trans-european transport.
           in another example, lisea, the concession company for the future tours–bordeaux high-speed rail line (sea hsl), established an economic
           think tank in september 2012. the role of this scientific body over the next 15 years is to measure, analyse and publish reports on the impact
           of the future high-speed line on employment, local economies and the development of regions along its route.


3.2	relations with civil society stakeholders: non-profit organisations,
     local residents, users and consumers
3.2.1      conditions for dialogue with stakeholders
           by their very nature, the activities of vinci companies interact with communities and their residents during both the construction and opera-
           tion phases. although public authorities are responsible for decisions on transport and energy infrastructure, as well as facilities to improve
           the living environment, including where they are to be located, vinci companies increasingly serve as a liaison with local communities, residents
           living in proximity to the structures they build, non-profit organisations and users. in general, the companies perceive consultation and dialogue
           with a project’s stakeholders as a means to create value. to provide a clear framework for this approach, vinci is developing a specific meth-
           odology and associated guidance tools. the need for this type of framework has become apparent since, although vinci’s contracting business
           requires consultation processes to guarantee the best result for all stakeholders during the works and project phases (public survey, safety of
           nearby residents and the wider local community, worksite hours and schedules, etc.), its concessions business involves these same processes
           over extended periods, sometimes as long as several decades.

           furthermore, it is important to distinguish between countries that already have a consultation framework – whether the one in place is sat-
           isfactory or in need of revision – from those that want to set one in place. given this range of working environments, vinci has adopted the
           simple reflex tool to fully involve partners in every aspect of a project, including its management. the tool has been tested using operational
           examples and is based in particular on vinci autoroutes’ experience. the first phase of this methodology involves mapping project stakehold-
           ers with three goals in mind: identifying their actual, felt and expressed needs with reference to solid material evidence; building structured
           and measurable solutions to address these needs; and directly involving stakeholders in project management.

           for example, in france, the design and construction of the last section of the a89 motorway between balbigny and la tour de salvagny placed
           a priority on dialogue and consultation with stakeholders – including administrative authorities, elected officials, local residents, farmers,
           environmental protection, hiking associations, and angling and wildlife federations – throughout the entire project. an environment committee
           was formed, bringing together local environmental protection associations and engineers from asf (vinci autoroutes), which met regularly.
           this experience sharing resulted in the drafting of an environmental charter including a complete set of measures. more than 2,000 employees,
           i.e. the full complement of staff working on the project, participated in sessions covering the importance of protecting the environment, including
           practical guidelines, offered by nature conservation associations as well as angling and wildlife federations.

           the project for the future tours–bordeaux sea hsl project in france is another example of vinci’s efforts in this area. more than 100 public
           meetings were held in 2012, which allowed the expectations of the various stakeholders to be identified and taken into account in the form
           of design adjustments. three working groups were established, bringing together local non-profit organisations and farmers, residents,
           chambers of commerce, other trade associations and regional authorities. through their participation in these working groups, all stakeholders
           contributed to the development of the method for implementing the offset measures, giving rise to a charter approved by everyone in 2012.
           since it went live in november 2011, the project’s website has logged more than 90,000 unique visitors, with an average of 1,000 each day.
           through this interface, more than 1,000 people have subscribed to lisea’s newsletter.

           vinci airports is taking part in the hearings of the agricultural, scientific and general public debate commissions set up at the end of 2012 by
           the french government to examine the future grand ouest airport project for western france. the agricultural commission is tasked with
           identifying locally the means of minimising the project’s impact on agricultural land and helping develop effective tools to combat rural space
           being swallowed up by urban development. in addition to the elements supplied by stakeholders affected by the transfer of the airport, the
           vinci airports subsidiary aéroport du grand ouest has provided all elements useful to writing the reports awaited by each of the commis-
           sions. the preparatory work for building the airport (displacement of networks, archaeological assessments, displacement of protected species)

162                                               report of the board of directors




        will start, subject to receiving authorisations from the prefecture in regard to protected species and the water act. it should be noted that
        only 537 hectares will be developed to bring the airport into service, of which 147 hectares will have artificial surfaces (runways, terminals,
        tarmac, etc.). over half of the land under concession will be conserved for use in its natural state and for agricultural purposes.

        in canada, djl, eurovia’s quebec-based subsidiary, has invested about €90,000 to create a buffer zone around the mont saint bruno national
        park, thus conserving biodiversity in an urban setting in order to recover the woodland balance in montreal’s greater metropolitan area.

        in russia, for the design and construction of the moscow–st petersburg motorway, vinci concessions has put in place an innovative tool to
        mediate conflicts with local residents relating to the environment. following a period of heated discussions about the project’s impact on
        khimki forest, which had raised concerns among environmental non-profit organisations, vinci concessions enlisted the services of a medi-
        ating body, the non-profit organisation pur projet, which specialises in resolving issues relating to reforestation. pur project engaged in dialogue
        with all stakeholders through a broad process of discussion and consultation with local residents, environmental non-profits, administrative
        authorities and municipalities. this mediation resulted in the joint development of a programme to conserve and improve the ecosystem of
        the forest in the path of the motorway. these actions were then incorporated in the environmental and social action plan established by nwcc,
        the consortium in charge of the project, validated by the concession grantor and the russian authorities and financed by nwcc and its
        shareholders (which include vinci concessions). the first concrete actions on the ground have been launched in response to the concerns
        expressed by the local community and non-profits: educational programmes in schools, studies to expand knowledge about areas of passage
        used by wild animals, restoration of the sacred spring water source, etc.

3.2.2   actions and sponsorship to combat exclusion and reinforce relations with social integration organisations
        vinci encourages group companies and their employees to take part in the fight against social exclusion. many companies are spearheading actions
        at local level in the regions where they operate. most of these actions relate to the fight against social exclusion, both on behalf of employees lacking
        job security and in support of communities where businesses are located. vinci set up a corporate foundation in 2002 called the fondation vinci
        pour la cité, which funds sustainable projects that promote ties across social groups and help people excluded from the labour market to find work
        by providing financial assistance to non-profit organisations, combined with volunteer efforts by group employees, who use their professional skills
        to aid those in need. in 2012, the fondation vinci pour la cité backed 196 projects in france, for a total of €2,546,000. contributions from group
        companies totalled €323,994 and those of external partners amounted to €76,000, while 277 employees assisted the beneficiary organisations.

        in line with vinci’s commitment to encourage employee participation in such actions worldwide, the group continues to expand the inter-
        national reach of assistance provided by its foundations in the context of an initiative launched in 2007. following the creation of structures
        similar to the fondation vinci in the czech republic (2008), germany (2010) and greece (2011), two new foundations were set up in 2012,
        one in belgium and the other in slovakia. for greater effectiveness, each foundation tailors its actions and its selection criteria to the socioeco-
        nomic context in which it provides support. in all, 86 projects have been backed to date outside france via these foundations since their
        inception, for a total amount of €964,212.

        organic market gardens to promote social integration. the fondation vinci pour la cité supports the creation of organic market gardens along
        motorways to promote social integration in partnership with réseau cocagne. on previously unused land close to service areas on vinci
        autoroutes motorways, four market gardens are producing organically grown vegetables, providing work for people excluded from the labour
        market.

        emmaüs défi. the fondation vinci pour la cité has lent its support to emmaüs défi for the opening of the largest social integration employ-
        ment centre in the paris region for the recycling and resale of clothing, furniture and household goods. working alongside the foundation,
        five companies from the energy business line contributed their expertise and carried out part of the electricity installation for the centre. this
        skills-based corporate patronage initiative involved a total of 4,000 hours of labour at the parisian centre, which opened to the public in june
        2012.

        fond de dotation sillon solidaire. created in 2012 in connection with the construction and operation of the high-speed rail line between tours
        and bordeaux, this fund is backed by the fondation vinci pour la cité and by all companies participating in lisea and the cosea joint venture.
        sillon solidaire aims to support projects undertaken by non-profit organisations that contribute to the fight against social exclusion in regions
        crossed by the new high-speed rail line: relocation services, housing assistance and educational support for school-age children. sillon solidaire
        identifies suitable mentors from among the employees at work on the project who volunteer their skills on behalf of the selected associations.
        the budget allocated to this project by the fund in 2012 was €310,000, divided among 31 non-profits.

3.2.3   actions and sponsorship to promote responsible driving and relations with road user associations
        in the contracting business, apart from public-private partnerships and the activities of vinci facilities (vinci energies), most vinci clients
        are public authorities or other companies. in the concessions business and under long-term partnerships, the customers of vinci companies
        are private individuals, providing the opportunity to build relationships over time, particularly in the area of services.

        the vinci autoroutes foundation for responsible driving, set up in february 2011, aims to raise awareness among drivers about road safety,
        promotes research on the risk of inattentiveness, which is responsible for a large number of fatal motorway accidents, and works to change
        driver behaviour through joint efforts with its partners and the various stakeholders, including institutions, professional bodies and non-profit
        organisations. this foundation gives vinci autoroutes a way of improving its understanding of the causes behind the accidents seen on today’s
        motorways, with the aim of designing new solutions and communicating more effectively to road users about these issues. the company’s effort
        has three thrusts. first, it backs initiatives by civil society organisations and supports innovative scientific research into certain areas of danger-
        ous driving that have not been sufficiently explored or that are incorrectly identified by road users. second, it carries out public information
        campaigns with the aim of raising awareness of road-related risks and promoting responsible driving. third, it develops knowledge relating to
        the specific driving habits of different motorway user groups to help them take greater responsibility for their own safety on a day-to-day basis.

        in 2012, the budget allocated to the activities of the vinci autoroutes foundation for responsible driving was €2 million. the major study
        financed by the foundation in 2011 and conducted by a team of researchers at hôpital raymond poincaré in garches, near paris, released its
        findings in 2012. the team was able to complete a meticulous analysis of the sleep patterns of drowsy motorists and confirmed the direct link
        between sleep deprivation and episodes of falling asleep at the wheel. furthermore, awareness campaigns targeting road users and the general
        public initiated in 2011 were expanded in 2012: risks related to alcohol consumption, the safety of motorway employees performing maintenance
        operations or coming to the assistance of drivers, special awareness days focusing on heavy goods vehicle drivers, participation in the 24-hour

           both 2011 and 2012, to raise awareness of responsible driving practices among university students by inviting them to submit proposals for
           innovative projects, awarded a trophy to a team from esdes lyon for its “les roues de l’espoir” (wheels of hope) project. lastly, all employees
           of vinci autoroutes are encouraged to suggest ideas for awareness campaigns and propose partnerships with associations whose actions
           they are able to support with the financial backing of the vinci autoroutes foundation for responsible driving. in 2012, the foundation’s
           selection committee approved 11 projects of this type, allocating a total budget of €70,000.

           in greece, gefyra, the rion–antirion bridge concession company, focused in 2012 on instilling dialogue and a process of consultation with
           users and local residents, promoting the user-citizen concept. the aim was to reconcile the expectations of stakeholders, often working at
           cross purposes, who are both users of the bridge and residents of the regions served. a very large number of consultation meetings were thus
           held during the year. an interactive newsletter was created, through which users are able to express their wishes.

3.2.4	relations and sponsorship actions in support of non-profit organisations working to protect the environment
       and cultural heritage
           as part of its goal to drive performance over the long term in all its areas of activity, vinci selects partnerships with non-profit organisations
           working to protect nature as well as those active in the cultural realm. environmental protection associations vary widely in their composition,
           governance, financing and expectations. the group’s actions are therefore carried out at local level and reflect where the companies are
           operating, the specific characteristics of projects and the type of business being performed.

           by way of example, entrepose contracting (vinci construction), which is working on a pipeline construction project in papua new guinea,
           has provided financial backing to the naturalist expedition programme “la planète revisitée” (“our planet revisited”), jointly organised by the
           natural history museum in paris and the non-governmental organisation pro-natura international in partnership with the institut de recherche
           pour le développement. the aim of these expeditions is to fill gaps in knowledge of species worldwide. for this third major expedition, some
           200 researchers representing 21 different countries, but also students and volunteers, set out for papua new guinea, considered as one of
           the world’s most significant biodiversity hotspots. neglected species were treated as priority survey targets: marine and land invertebrates,
           plants, fungi and algae. the teams also measured the human impact on ecosystems and changes expected due to climate change.

           eurovia adheres to the french government’s national strategy to promote biodiversity. to this end, the business line has entered into a partner-
           ship with the french natural history museum, which will lend its scientific expertise and assist eurovia in its ongoing efforts to improve its
           biodiversity management as part of its activities. lisea, the concession company for the future tours–bordeaux high-speed rail line, has set
           up its biodiversity foundation, with a budget of €5 million over the next five years, involving the participation of representatives from france’s
           biodiversity research foundation and natural history museum.

           companies have a duty to contribute to cultural production, without neglecting the historical and regional context in which it is pursued.
           across the group, many companies are partners or sponsors of non-profit organisations protecting built assets, cultural institutions and events.
           at local level, vinci companies volunteer their assistance and technical expertise in connection with a large number of projects aimed at
           restoring cultural heritage treasures. these companies are locally recognised for their voluntary actions and take part in heritage conservation
           efforts in line with long-standing traditions and predilections. vinci is continuing its major cultural sponsorship actions by supporting local
           cultural initiatives across france, notably in the cities of lyon, nantes and nancy, with the aim of continuing to preserve and raise the profile
           of artistic creation in the urban environment. current sponsorship actions include the lighting of the palais du pharo in marseille, which has
           dominated the entrance to this city’s harbour since the reign of napoleon iii, and the restoration of the grand salon at the maison des etudiants
           de l’asie du sud-est, an architectural jewel at the cité internationale universitaire in paris. these are just a few examples of actions underscor-
           ing the group’s commitment to cultural life in communities and preserving the heritage treasures of the past.

           at group level, as a leading sponsor of archaeological heritage studies, vinci is an active member of the group of industry players involved in
           land-use planning brought together by the institut national de recherches archéologiques préventive (inrap, france’s rescue archaeology
           institute) and takes part in discussions to focus greater attention on and recognise the achievements of archaeological discoveries in the
           course of work on projects. in 2011, vinci airports renewed the partnership initiated in 2004, in the form of a five-year agreement to continue
           its financing of a major archaeological dig at the site of siem reap airport in cambodia, in close proximity to the famed angkor temple complex.
           these digs are conducted by inrap, in partnership with apsara, the cambodian government agency for the protection and management of
           angkor and the siem ream region. in this region, archaeologists have tended to focus on the temples frequented by the elite in the heyday of
           the khmer empire, but this project aims to shed light instead on the way of life of the artisans having built the temples. in 2012, archaeological
           excavations near the airport’s runways yielded interesting discoveries about the region’s inhabitants during the period. they also provided an
           ideal opportunity to train cambodian archaeologists, assisted by 85 vinci employees at the site. vinci airports is also a long-standing partner
           and shareholder of artisans d’angkor, an organisation created to perpetuate and encourage the development of khmer traditional crafts, while
           offering career possibilities to the underprivileged populations of the siem reap region. each artisan receives a contractual salary and a full
           benefits package. artisans d’angkor has lifted some 5,000 families out of poverty and promotes economic vitality in the local area.

3.2.5	partnerships and sponsorship actions to expand access to essential services and support social entrepreneurs
           around the world, wherever they operate, group companies support solidarity and development initiatives. these actions are targeted, tailored
           to address local challenges and thus vary depending on the region and its socioeconomic circumstances.

           initiatives pursued by subsidiaries also relate to the nature of the work carried out in each region, which may or may not involve their presence
           over the long term and may relate to large-scale projects completed in short time frames or recurring work, etc. as initiatives differ widely,
           this information is not consolidated at group level. the examples below illustrate just a few of the actions conducted locally by subsidiaries.

           in africa, initiatives sogea-satom pour l’afrique (issa) supports projects in two main fields – assistance provided to social entrepreneurs and
           access to essential services – involving both financial aid and the sharing of skills by employee volunteers. in the area of assistance provided
           to social entrepreneurs, issa supported 14 projects in 2012: agricultural development, support and promotion of local crafts and know-how,
           and equipment to improve production and productivity. some 12 projects were supported in the area of access to essential services: access
           to water and electricity, access to education (refurbishment or construction of classroom facilities) and access to healthcare (dispensaries,
           maternity centres). in all, issa committed €440,000 to projects in 2012 in several countries, chief among them benin, burundi, morocco, chad,
           cameroon and south africa.

164                                              report of the board of directors




        personnel at all sogea-satom projects are involved in the fight against hiv/aids, with information meetings and awareness campaigns target-
        ing employees and local residents where applicable. these meetings are held on a regular basis at worksites, organised by project supervisors
        in collaboration with local associations.

        in chile, the eurovia subsidiary bitumix has been active for 25 years in social programmes, its actions prompted by the issues and needs it identifies
        among its employees, which are then expanded to serve the surrounding communities. for example, bitumix has offered its employees and their families
        free medical care for 25 years, with a permanent facility receiving patients for medical and dental treatment several times a week. in 2012, 300 medical
        and psychiatric visits were accommodated and 700 treatments were delivered in the dental clinic set up by the company. the company also offers free
        check-up visits for employees’ newborn infants, from birth to 12 months of age. as another example of its wide-ranging commitment, in the event of
        natural disaster, bitumix comes to the aid of communities. in the aftermath of a recent earthquake, the company provided machinery and labour for a
        period of four months to demolish damaged buildings and clear debris in the most affected areas.


3.3     suppliers and subcontractors
        see also page 21 of this annual report
        manifesto commitment number 1: “design and build together”

3.3.1   general policy
        in 2012, purchases represented about 60% of the group’s revenue, remaining stable compared with the previous year, and comprised of €9.43
        billion for materials and €14.85 billion for external services, including subcontracting and the cost of temporary staff. during the year, vinci
        reaffirmed its commitment to building balanced and sustainable relationships with its suppliers and subcontractors. the group moved forward
        with efforts to measure and take into account workforce-related, social and environmental factors in the overall value chain.
        these efforts are overseen by the purchasing coordination unit at group level, a relatively small structure that was reinforced in 2012 with
        the arrival of new experts specialising in specific purchasing categories. this unit works with the purchasing departments of business lines
        and subsidiaries, and reports to a member of vinci’s executive committee. this approach is implemented at local level by purchasing networks,
        in particular through decentralised purchasing clubs in france and the various countries where vinci operates.

        in september 2012, a national convention bringing together the members of all group purchasing networks was held in chantilly in the greater
        paris area to clarify vinci’s purchasing strategy in relation to three areas: an optimised supplier selection process, strategic partnerships and
        sustainable development. this triennial event provided an opportunity to enhance internal communication, share best practices and promote
        a proactive approach for the integration of workforce-related, environmental and social criteria.
        a supplier charter explicitly describing overall performance commitments has been developed in order to communicate vinci’s expectations to its
        partners and reaffirm the need for compliance with the 10 principles of the un’s global compact. this document is currently being distributed to
        all group suppliers. complementing its own internal procedures, vinci has signed the charte des relations inter-entreprises, developed by a special
        task force made up of french government representatives and members of the compagnie des dirigeants et acheteurs de france (cdaf, the french
        industrial buyers association), as a further demonstration of its commitment to good conduct in client-supplier relations. some 305 french companies
        have signed this charter since it was launched by the cdaf in february 2010 with the aim of promoting fair practices and improving relations
        between major clients and smes. within the group, vinci construction’s purchasing department has obtained iso 9001 certification.

        in addition to the framework agreements signed by business lines and subsidiaries with their suppliers, over 800 national, european and global
        cross-business framework agreements were signed in 2012 to meet the multiple procurement requirements of group companies.

        in 2012, the sustainable development and purchasing committee opened up several discussion groups. this forum helps foster long-term,
        balanced relationships with the group’s suppliers and subcontractors and ensures that workforce-related, social and environmental issues
        are factored into the value chain. its approach is to simplify and adjust internal communication to make it more operationally appropriate, to
        define and implement tools and methods, and to share and disseminate best practices.

        a new training programme to raise buyers’ awareness of key sustainable development issues is currently under development, designed to assist
        these staff members in their day-to-day activities by providing the tools and responses necessary to promote more responsible practices.

3.3.2   managing relations with suppliers
        in 2012, the group’s purchasing policy led to an increasing emphasis on sustainable development criteria both when selecting products and
        suppliers and when drafting framework agreements and specifications for the group and its business lines. these criteria take into account
        the environmental impact of products and services, the workforce-related arrangements for producing or providing them, and the social
        commitments made by suppliers. a review of feedback received clearly indicates that these efforts add value.

        environmental performance. in its purchasing agreements, vinci increasingly favours products that are more environment friendly. in 2012,
        several tenders included questionnaires aimed specifically at differentiating suppliers in relation to these concerns.

        for example, in the vehicle category (manufacturers and long-term rental companies), emphasis was placed on emission levels, the percentage
        of recycled materials and end-of-life procedures. the group has also adopted initiatives regarding zero-emission vehicles and infrastructure
        development. vinci is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of its vehicle fleet. group companies have tested electric vehicles under
        real-world conditions and vinci park is taking part in renault-nissan’s seine aval véhicules electriques (save) initiative to promote the use
        of electric vehicles. over an 18-month period, this project will test the manufacturer’s electric vehicles in urban and suburban environments,
        supported by a pilot network of 300 charging stations.

        vinci autoroutes has implemented environmental clauses for all of its referenced suppliers as well as a shared assessment template used by
        asf, cofiroute and escota. first used at vinci construction for purchases of fitting and finishing services, all group suppliers are now assessed
        on the basis of iso environmental criteria. this approach has been extended to all purchasing categories with a view to continuous improve-
        ment and enhanced coordination.

        workforce-related performance. this strategy also involves paying greater attention to workforce-related and social issues when selecting
        suppliers. safety concerns are a priority across the entire group. in 2012, meetings were arranged with all temporary employment agencies
        to monitor their progress in implementing recommended measures and to reinforce dialogue with the suppliers involved. this referencing

      vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the board of directors                                                                 165




              procedure resulted in significant improvements in the area of safety measures observed by temporary workers. in assessing the workforce-
              related performance of purchasing, this is the primary differentiating factor.

              with regard to personal protective equipment, emphasis was placed on working conditions throughout the supply chain. vinci construction
              has introduced fines for failing to comply with safety clauses. in addition, a safety culture charter has been developed jointly by all stakehold-
              ers, including suppliers as well as joint contractors and subcontractors. furthermore, a national strategy has been put in place for the monitoring
              of purchases of finished goods, involving the validation of selected suppliers by regional committees and the negotiation of group-wide
              framework contracts allowing for greater involvement of vinci’s commercial partners.

              social responsibility performance. across the group and through its various projects, vinci develops partnership-based approaches with its
              suppliers and favours relationships at local level with small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). the group increasingly prefers suppliers
              with strong roots in their regions in its selection and bidding processes. its policy also involves expanding purchases from companies and
              non-profit organisations that work towards social integration for the long-term unemployed and people with disabilities. a number of new
              initiatives focusing on the development of partnerships with sheltered workshops were launched in 2012 by the group’s business lines, a
              banner year for this category of actions.

              in france, vinci has signed a national framework agreement with association des paralysés de france for the collection and recycling of waste
              electrical and electronic equipment and with ateliers sans frontières for the collection and refurbishment of discarded computer equipment
              for resale at preferential prices to other non-profit organisations. in 2012, nearly 54.5 tonnes of equipment were recycled. revenue generated
              with sheltered workshops remained stable for the collection of weee.

              in connection with the project for the construction of the new tours–bordeaux high-speed rail line, a special unit has been set up to manage
              the €450 million in strategic purchases affecting multiple group entities for the four business lines involved in the project. the aim of the
              preparatory phase was to put in place a procurement logistics system that would be viable over the long term, assist suppliers with workforce-
              related and social requirements, contribute to the social integration aspect of the project and ensure the participation of local economic actors.
              volumes have been allocated in accordance with supplier capacities.

              the group’s civic engagement also takes the form of combating social exclusion and building bridges with people who suffer employment
              difficulties. to further these actions, a national consultation process was launched in summer 2012 to list temporary employment agencies
              in france that operate in the field of social integration through work. with social integration clauses being increasingly included in contracts,
              vinci wants to anticipate its clients’ requirements and is therefore taking a proactive approach and supporting organisations that it works
              with to help them expand.

3.3.3         managing relations with subcontractors
              subcontractors are generally selected from among small and medium-sized enterprises located near group projects or worksites, thereby
              contributing to local economic development. these partners are increasingly involved in project planning and preparation. workforce-related
              and environmental clauses are gradually being added to their contracts. the general policy is to strengthen relationships over the long term.
              subcontractors and joint contractors have long demonstrated their commitment to the group’s safety policy.

              a best practices charter is nearing finalisation with a view to dissemination to all subcontractors and joint contractors in the first half of 2013.
              the charter addresses the following topics: compliance with regulations in force, ethical behaviour, improvement of health and safety criteria;
              balanced business relations; fairness and objectivity in relations with partners; use of local enterprises; governance and social responsibility.

              vinci construction france has introduced specific clauses relating to environmental protection, waste management and the impact of its
              projects. visual aids have been developed to raise awareness among all personnel concerned. these posters are available in french, portuguese
              and arabic, the three most common working languages at the entity’s worksites in france. as a further example, vinci construction grands
              projets trains all of its subcontractors in waste management, related risks and their potential impact. through the alive on site programme,
              some 2,800 people have been trained in safety procedures. emergency drills and the verification of qualifications are critical to the success
              of projects. thanks to the use of the insight system, the company’s accident frequency rate has been reduced by a factor of three since 2010.
              it monitors some 20 indicators to further improve practices at its worksites, including greater awareness of the environmental regulations
              affecting vinci. four-fifths of the revenue of vinci construction grands projets is derived from work with subcontractors.

3.3.4         outlook
              in 2012, vinci’s purchasing coordination unit adopted sustainable development as a strategic priority. over the next three years, the unit aims
              to ensure the comprehensive integration of workforce-related, social and environmental criteria by all group companies, coupled with the
              development of a coordination and monitoring tool incorporating key indicators to assess progress in this area. the group is currently examin-
              ing the possibility of setting up an audit procedure for strategic purchases.


3.4           fair business practices
              see also page 22 of this annual report
              manifesto commitment number 2: “comply with ethical principles together”

3.4.1         prevention of corruption
              vinci’s code of ethics and conduct contains all the rules of conduct that apply to all group companies and employees. in 2012, the group
              continued its efforts to disseminate and explain the code to managers, who then made similar efforts within their own organisations. the
              group actively monitors this procedure, and an intranet tool enables executive management and the internal audit team to check that it is
              being deployed. reports are submitted to the executive committee on a regular basis, allowing remedial action to be taken quickly if required.
              regular training sessions are organised to promote understanding of group principles and values. at 31 december 2012, of the 6,499 people
              identified as particularly exposed, 95% had acknowledged receiving the code. the aim is to reach 100%.

              the appointment of an ethics officer as part of vinci’s whistle-blowing arrangements was widely communicated within the group. any employee
              can contact the ethics officer in accordance with rules set out in the code, which include a guarantee of confidentiality, the commitment to
              respect the integrity and status of all employees, and the avoidance of discrimination. several matters were referred to the ethics officer during

166                                             report of the board of directors




        the year. in each case, the issues were investigated thoroughly, in compliance with the aforementioned principles. in 2012, the ethics officer
        dealt with all queries received, resulting in various types of measure.

3.4.2   user health and safety
        road risks affect all vinci employees who drive any of the group’s 30,000 company vehicles or 10,000 site machines, as well as the 600 mil-
        lion users of motorways, roads, car parks and other infrastructure operated by vinci worldwide under concession contracts. campaigns are
        organised to raise awareness and training is provided for those employees most exposed to road risk. one of the working groups created as
        part of the group’s safe together initiative has been tasked with promoting the sharing of best practices in this field.

        in october 2012, vinci autoroutes staged a truck village event on the a7 motorway for hgv drivers. the event was an opportunity to discuss
        road safety with professional drivers and describe a new range of services to them: medical screening, information on risks related to drowsi-
        ness and addictions, small covered athletic fields, and free charging stations for it devices.

        as an example of its reinforced efforts in this area, in 2011, vinci autoroutes set up a corporate foundation to promote responsible driving
        and raise awareness of the dangers of poor road safety, the vinci autoroutes foundation for responsible driving (see 3.2.3). in partnership
        with the non-profit organisation “40 millions d’automobilistes”, the foundation distributed 100,000 breathalysers at 12 service areas on french
        motorways in may 2012 over ascension weekend. the purpose of this accident prevention campaign was to encourage drivers to test them-
        selves in order to know their alcohol consumption limits and thus help keep roads and motorways safe.


3.5     human rights
        vinci has been a signatory to the un global compact since 2003. it is thus committed to supporting and promoting respect for human rights
        within its sphere of influence, and to ensuring that group companies are not complicit in human rights abuses. in practical terms, the group
        acts on this commitment by including clauses relating to human rights in its framework agreements with suppliers and subcontractors. the
        external audit of qdvc (vinci construction grands projets) performed in 2011 by an independent consultancy (vigeo group), identified areas
        for improvement in relation to protecting and promoting human rights internationally and provided an opportunity to test advance, the group’s
        sustainable development self-assessment questionnaire.

        as a result of these actions, the group’s procedures for the identification of human rights risks were refined in 2012. with respect to employees
        and subcontractors working on vinci sites as well as the group’s suppliers, the key human rights issues are preserving the wellbeing of group
        employees and all those who work on vinci sites, protecting the fundamental rights of migrant workers, the right to a decent salary, avoidance
        of discrimination, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, and the prohibition of child labour and forced labour.

        the fundamental rights of populations likely to be affected by the group’s activities include in particular risks associated with the use of
        security services, property rights in the event of expropriation and the rights of indigenous peoples.

        the operational application of vinci’s human rights policy is carried out by its subsidiaries, using advance, the group’s self-assessment tool,
        to identify their risks precisely, based on their activities and the countries where they operate. the group’s delegation for sustainable
        development and its purchasing coordination unit lend their expertise as necessary. the latter disseminates framework agreements and has
        drafted a charter setting out the global performance commitments of vinci suppliers, explicitly stating the group’s policies with regard to
        human rights and working conditions.

        no disputes, claims or controversies of any kind arose in relation to human rights in 2012.



4.      note on the methods used in social and environmental reporting
        vinci’s social and environmental reporting framework complies with articles l.225-102-1, r.225-104 and r.225-105 of the french commercial
        code and is based on the transparency principles of the global reporting initiative (gri).


4.1     methodological procedures
        vinci’s procedures are specified in the following materials:

        ˇˇ for social indicators:
        - a guidebook in four languages (french, english, german and spanish) containing social indicator definitions;
        - a methodological guide to vinci’s social reporting system, including a reporting tool users’ manual in four languages (french, english, german
        and spanish);
        - a guide to consistency checks in two languages (french and english);

        ˇˇ for environmental indicators:
         - a methodological guide to vinci’s environmental reporting system, including a guide to the definition of common indicators, which entities
        can use to set up their environmental reporting procedures. this guide is available in two languages (french and english);
        - an it system users’ manual in two languages (french and english);
        - an audit guide helping entities to make preparations and respond to audit results (available in french and english).

        all of the above materials are accessible on the group’s intranet site.

        the group’s efforts to accelerate its social and environmental reporting process in 2010 resulted in:
        ˇˇ new methods for earlier preparation of social indicators, applicable to all entities since 2011;
        ˇˇ the shifting of the reference period for environmental reporting by one quarter (the reference period for year y is now from 1 october y-1
        to 30 september y). this change has applied to all entities since 2010.

      vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the board of directors                                                               167




4.2           scope
              the reporting scope is intended to be representative of all vinci’s business activities:
              ˇˇ social reporting has covered all group entities by worldwide revenue since 2002;
              ˇˇ in 2012, environmental reporting covered 95% of group entities by worldwide revenue.


              since 2011, the consolidation rules used for these scopes are the same as the financial consolidation rules, except for the following entities,
              which are still consolidated proportionally:
              ˇˇ vinci construction grands projets: all projects;
              ˇˇ cfe: all cfe group companies, including the stake in deme (belgium);
              ˇˇ soletanche freyssinet: tierra armada sa, grupo rodio kronsa and freyssinet sa (spain).


              these consolidation rules apply to all reporting indicators, except the “number of environmental incidents” indicator, in which all incidents
              count for 1.

              changes in scope
              ˇˇ social reporting scope: changes in scope in year y are taken into account in the same year.
              ˇˇ environmental reporting scope: changes in scope in year y are taken into account in year y+1.




4.3           indicator selection
              indicators are selected on the basis of the social and environmental impact of the group’s activities and the risks associated with those
              activities.

              there are three levels of core social indicators:
              ˇˇ those specified in articles r.225-104 and r.225-105 of the french commercial code;
              ˇˇ those included in the social report, as required by french law; and
              ˇˇ specific indicators reflecting vinci’s human resources policy.


              the complementary nature of these three levels of indicators makes it possible to measure the results of the group’s human resources policy
              and social commitments.

              the core environmental indicators are made up of five types:
              ˇˇ resource consumption (energy/co        and water);
                                                      2
              ˇˇ waste management and recycling;
              ˇˇ certifications and special projects;
              ˇˇ environmental awareness and training;
              ˇˇ environmental incidents and provisions for environmental risks.


              each business line continues to use its own additional indicators, which are based on its specific environmental challenges.


4.4           methodological explanations and limitations
              the methodologies used for some social and environmental indicators may be subject to limitations due to:
              ˇˇ differences between french and international definitions (which vinci is working to harmonise);
              ˇˇ differences in labour and social laws in some countries;
              ˇˇ the fact that some estimates may not be representative or that some external data required for calculations may not be available, particularly
              data required for environmental indicators at vinci construction, where a statistical approach is being deployed for this purpose;
              ˇˇ changes in indicator definitions that could affect their comparability;
              ˇˇ changes in business scope from one year to the next;
              ˇˇ the difficulty of collecting data from a subcontractor or joint venture with external partners;
              ˇˇ the procedures for collecting and entering this information.


              eurovia france and eurovia belgium’s water consumption and eurovia france’s energy consumption are calculated on the basis of financial
              amounts and associated average prices for the 2012 environmental reporting reference period. continued efforts are being made to report
              consumption levels directly.

              due to the restructuring at the end of september 2012 that impacted some entities recently integrated into vinci energies france, these
              entities did not report actual environmental data for the third quarter of 2012 but provided estimates based on the previous nine months.

              for vinci plc, figures for total waste generation and the percentage of waste recycled are based on estimated fill ratios of waste skips, taking
              into account the type and density of the waste.

              since 2011, vinci park in france has altered its method of calculating purchased water consumption. for car parks outside paris that do not
              have automatic sprinkler-type fire extinguishing systems, water consumption is calculated from the total purchase cost of water divided by
              its average price in france. for other car parks, water consumption corresponds to the volume of water purchased.

              total energy consumption is expressed in mwh higher calorific value (hcv). the conversion factors used are 0.0104 mwh/litre, 12.027 mwh/
              tonne and 4.839 mwh/tonne for motor fuel, heavy fuel oil and coal (lignite), respectively.

168                                           report of the board of directors




      for vinci construction france, consumption of water, electricity and heating oil on worksites (“mobile sites”) is estimated using a statistical
      method. coefficients reflecting the relationship between environmental indicators and revenues are calculated on the basis of a representative
      sample of worksites. these coefficients were then used to extrapolate results to all worksites, by applying them to consolidated revenue for
      the period from 1 october 2011 to 30 september 2012.

      the figures in the annual report are based on data known at the end of the financial year. they may, however, be adjusted the following year
      if a significant anomaly is observed and provided that the adjustment is substantiated in detail. none of the figures published in the 2011
      annual report were adjusted in 2012.

      occupational illnesses are defined as illnesses contracted following prolonged exposure to a professional risk (noise, hazardous products,
      posture, etc.) and recognised as such by the regulations in force.


4.5   consolidation and internal control
      social data is collected from each operational entity using a specific package of the “vision ii” data reporting system, including automatic
      controls. data is checked and validated by the group entities themselves. this data is then consolidated in two steps:
      ˇˇ step 1: business lines
      each business line consolidates all data within its scope. when consolidation takes place, data consistency checks are carried out. having
      been consolidated and checked at the business-line level, data is then provided to the group human resources department.
      ˇˇ step 2: group human resources department
      the group hr department consolidates data across the whole scope and checks its consistency.

      environmental data is collected, checked, consolidated and validated by the environment managers in each business line and division using
      their own it tools. the data is then consolidated centrally using “vision ii”. when consolidation takes place, data consistency checks are carried
      out at group level by the delegation for sustainable development. comparisons are made with the previous year’s data and any material
      discrepancies are analysed in detail.


4.6   external controls
      each year since 2003, vinci has asked its statutory auditors to give their opinion on the quality of the procedures used to report social and
      environmental information. in 2012, the audit was conducted by both statutory auditors. the social and environmental indicators that they
      audited are identified in the tables by the þ symbol (see pages 139 to 157). the nature of the auditing work carried out and the findings are
      presented on pages 177 to 178.

             corporate purpose (article 2 of the articles of association)
             the company has as its purpose:
             ˇˇ undertaking all forms of civil engineering: in particular, development of the goodwill originally contributed by sainrapt-et-brice and conti-
             nuation of the business of that company, specialising in all types of underground works, foundations, hydraulics and reinforced concrete; and
             ˇˇ more generally, all industrial, commercial, financial, securities and property operations directly or indirectly related to the purposes specified
             above.
             the company may pursue these operations in metropolitan france and overseas france, as well as other countries, either alone, or in partner-
             ship, on a trading basis, or in any other form whatsoever, either directly, or indirectly through transfer, leasing arrangements or under licence,
             either on a brokerage or commission basis.
             in addition, it may implement any measures, either alone or by any other means, create any partnerships or companies, make any contributions
             in kind to existing companies, merge or enter into alliances with them, subscribe, purchase and resell any shares or other corporate rights,
             take all orders and extend any loans, credits and advances.

             statutory appropriation of income (excerpt from article 19 of the articles of association)
             at least 5% of the income for the year, after deduction of any previous year’s losses, is taken to the statutory reserve. this ceases to be obliga-
             tory when the reserve reaches an amount equal to 10% of the share capital. this process is to resume when the reserve falls below this 10%
             level.
             the income available for distribution consists of the income for the year (after deduction of previous years’ losses as well as any amounts set
             aside in reserves in application of the law or articles of association) and retained earnings.
             the shareholders’ general meeting allocates the following from this distributable income:
             ˇˇ any amounts considered by the board of directors as appropriate for constituting or supplementing any ordinary or special reserves, or for
             carrying over to the next year as retained earnings;
             ˇˇ the amount required for distribution to shareholders by way of a first dividend, equal to 5% of the amounts of their fully paid, unredeemed
             shares. shareholders cannot, however, claim this dividend against the income of subsequent years should the income of a given year be insuf-
             ficient for the dividend payment;
             ˇˇ the balance available after these allocations is distributed in respect of all shares, in proportion to the amount of the share capital they
             represent.
             following a proposal from the board of directors, the shareholders’ general meeting may decide to distribute amounts taken from available
             reserves. in such a case, the decision must indicate the specific reserves from which the amounts are to be taken.
             except in the case of a capital reduction, no distribution to shareholders may be made if the shareholders’ equity is (or would be, following
             such a distribution) less than the amount of the share capital plus any reserves whose distribution is not permitted under the law or articles
             of association.
             the conditions for payment of dividends agreed by the shareholders’ general meeting are determined by the shareholders’ general meeting
             or, failing that, by the board of directors. the payment of dividends must occur within nine months of the year-end, unless this deadline is
             extended by a court decision.
             the shareholders’ general meeting may offer each shareholder, for all or for part of the dividend or interim dividend distributed, the choice
             between payment in cash and payment in shares.

             shareholders’ general meetings (article 17 and excerpt from article 8 of the articles of association)
             article 17 of the articles of association is described in the report of the chairman of the board of directors, part a5 “formalities for participa-
             tion of shareholders in the shareholders’ general meeting”, page 187.

             excerpt from article 8 of the articles of association:
             in addition to the voting right attached to it under the law, each share gives the right to a proportion (based on the number and nominal value
             of outstanding shares) of the company’s assets, earnings and liquidating dividends.

      statutory threshold provisions (excerpt from article 10b of the articles of association)
      in addition to the obligations relating to declaration thresholds set out in paragraph 1 of article l.233-7 of the french commercial code, any
      individual or legal entity, acting alone or in concert, who comes to hold or ceases to hold a proportion of the share capital, voting rights or
      securities giving future access to the company’s share capital, equal to or greater than 1%, or a multiple thereof, including a multiple exceeding
      the reporting threshold as defined by legislative and regulatory provisions in force, must inform the company within five stock market trading
      days of the date of crossing one of these thresholds or, when a shareholders’ general meeting has been convened, no later than midnight
      (paris time) of the third business day preceding the meeting, of the total number of shares, voting rights or securities giving future access to
      the company’s share capital that it holds on its own account directly or indirectly, or in concert.
      failure to meet this obligation will be sanctioned by the loss of the voting rights attached to the shares exceeding the undeclared proportion
      at any shareholders’ general meeting held within two years of the date of the due notification provided for above.
      this sanction is applied if so requested by one or several shareholders holding at least 5% of the company’s share capital and if the request
      is entered in the minutes of the shareholders’ general meeting.

      shareholder identification (excerpt from article 10b of the articles of association)
      the company is entitled to ask the securities clearing body, under the conditions defined by the regulations in force, for the name, nationality
      and address of individuals or legal entities holding securities that confer, now or in the future, voting rights at its shareholders’ general meetings;
      for the number of securities held by each individual or legal entity; and, where applicable, the restrictions attached to those securities.

       (*) simplified organisation chart of the group at 31 december 2012.
       vinci’s direct shareholdings in subsidiaries and affiliates are described on page 290. the list of the main consolidated companies (pages 268–274) gives an indication of the subsidiaries that
       comprise the group and of vinci’s equity interest (whether direct or indirect) in the various entities.

      vinci 2012 annual report                              report of the board of directors                                                                171




2.2           role of the vinci holding company towards its subsidiaries
              the vinci holding company has no operational activities of its own. the group’s operational activities are carried out by a large number of
              affiliates (there were 2,350 consolidated affiliates at 31 december 2012), which are organised into five business lines within two core busi-
              nesses, concessions (vinci autoroutes and vinci concessions) and contracting (vinci energies, eurovia and vinci construction). vinci
              immobilier, which is in charge of property development activities, reports directly to the vinci holding company.
              the holding company provides leadership and supervisory functions for the group’s operational entities, supplying services and assistance
              to its subsidiaries in the following areas:
              ˇˇ development and execution of strategy, acquisitions and disposals, and the study and implementation of industrial and commercial synergies
              within the group;
              ˇˇ provision of expertise in administrative, legal, human resources, tax, financial, communication and sustainable development matters.


              vinci also shares with its subsidiaries the benefits associated with the group’s size and reputation, such as access to internationally recognised
              partners, optimisation of terms for financing, purchases and insurance, easier access to regulatory authorities, and public relations.


2.3           movements of funds between the vinci holding company and its subsidiaries
              the main movements of funds between the vinci holding company and its subsidiaries, other than the payment of dividends, are as
              follows:

              payment for the holding company’s assistance to its subsidiaries
              in exchange for the assistance provided to its subsidiaries, the holding company receives a fee depending on the services provided. in 2012,
              fees for assistance received by vinci from its subsidiaries amounted to €103 million.

              centralised cash management
              group subsidiaries’ cash surpluses are generally invested with the holding company through a cash pooling system. in return, the holding
              company meets subsidiaries’ financing needs. the holding company acts on the money and financial markets on its own behalf or on its
              subsidiaries’ behalf, investing and borrowing funds as necessary. with some exceptions (the main one to date being asf and its subsidiaries
              in accordance with the contracts entered into with the caisse nationale des autoroutes), this system applies to all french subsidiaries wholly
              owned, directly or indirectly, by vinci.

              vinci finance international, a wholly owned subsidiary of vinci, centralises all the cash flows of foreign subsidiaries working in the group’s
              main markets in europe and north america.
              vinci and vinci finance international may make medium-term loans to some subsidiaries to finance investments and working capital and
              receive funds from other subsidiaries for fixed-term deposits. at 31 december 2012, these transactions represented outstandings for vinci
              of €2,160 million for medium-term loans and €788 million for fixed-term deposits, and outstandings for vinci finance international of
              €3,851 million for medium-term loans and €212 million for fixed-term deposits.

              regulated agreements
              there are regulated agreements between vinci and its subsidiaries, which are subject to prior authorisation by the board of directors, special
              reports by the statutory auditors and approval by the shareholders’ general meeting.

3.2   potential capital
      the only existing financial instruments that could cause the creation of new shares are the share subscription options granted to vinci officers
      and employees (see section d, “company officers and executives”, paragraph 4.2, on page 134 of the report of the board of directors for details
      of these options). share subscription options would become exercisable in the event of a public offer.

      voting rights
      the difference between the breakdown of shareholdings and voting rights is due to the absence of voting rights attached to treasury shares.
      there are no double voting rights.

              crossing of shareholding thresholds
              according to the declarations received by the company in 2012 notifying that the legal threshold of 5% or the 1% threshold provided for in
              the articles of association of share capital or voting rights had been crossed, the shareholders identified at 31 december 2012 as owning
              more than 1% of the share capital or voting rights, other than those shown in the table on the previous page, are as follows:
              ˇˇ alecta: one declaration in 2012, which mentions a shareholding in vinci of 1.0% on 11 january 2012;
              ˇˇ société générale: four declarations in 2012; the latest mentions a shareholding in vinci of 4.5% on 14 may 2012;
              ˇˇ crédit suisse: six declarations in 2012; the latest mentions a shareholding in vinci of 1.3% on 15 may 2012;
              ˇˇ natixis: two declarations in 2012; the latest mentions a shareholding in vinci of 1.9% on 29 may 2012;
              ˇˇ amundi: five declarations in 2012; the latest mentions a shareholding in vinci of 3.1% on 19 july 2012;
              ˇˇ ubs: two declarations in 2012; the latest mentions a shareholding in vinci of 1.4% on 19 november 2012.
              in a letter dated 6 february 2012, financière pinault, in presumed concert with its subsidiaries artémis 12 and tem, declared that on
              31 january 2012 its shareholding fell below the threshold of 2% of the company’s share capital or voting rights, to 1.4% of the share capital.
              to the best of the company’s knowledge, there are no other shareholders owning 1% or more of the share capital of vinci who declared in
              2012 having crossed either the legal threshold or the threshold provided for in the articles of association.

              shareholder agreements
              in april 2010, following the transaction under which cegelec was transferred to vinci, the qatari diar real estate investment company (qatari
              diar) acquired a shareholding in vinci. this acquisition was accompanied by a stable shareholding agreement, under which vinci agreed to
              reserve a seat on its board of directors for a person nominated by qatari diar and the first director was appointed by the shareholders’ general
              meeting of 6 may 2010. since 29 november 2012, mr abdul hamid janahi has been the permanent representative of qatari diar, replacing
              mr yousuf ahmad al hammadi. under the agreement, qatari diar shall maintain a shareholding in vinci of between 5% and 8% for a period
              of three years starting on 14 april 2010, barring certain non-significant exceptions (see the 14 april 2010 press release issued regarding this
              transaction). vinci shall have a right of first offer (or, in some cases, a pre-emptive right) on any disposals by qatari diar of blocks of shares
              representing more than 1.0% of the share capital.
              to the best of the company’s knowledge, with the exception of this agreement and the presumed concerted action of financière pinault with
              artémis 12 and tem, which it controls, there are no shareholder agreements or groups of shareholders acting as partners.

              registered shareholders
              at 31 december 2012, the company had 4,264 shareholders whose registration is managed by the company and 1,513 shareholders whose
              registration is managed by a financial institution. at that date, 304,851 shares whose registration is managed by the company and 188,144
              shares whose registration is managed by a financial institution were pledged.

              ments on page 283.


3.5           shareholders’ agreement relating to asf shares
              in december 2006, in connection with the financing of the transfer by vinci of its 22.99% shareholding in asf to asf holding, vinci entered
              into a shareholders’ agreement with its subsidiary asf holding, to which this shareholding was transferred, under which the two companies
              organise their relations within asf.
              under the terms of this agreement, the parties undertake, as majority shareholders of asf, to act in such a way as to ensure that the decisions
              made by the competent governing bodies of asf comply with:
              ˇˇ the principle of implementing and maintaining a policy of maximising the dividends distributed on the basis of asf’s distributable income and
              reserves, provided asf meets its commitments to a syndicate of 23 banks in respect of the €3.5 billion financing signed on 18 december 2006,
              and, in particular, with the following financial ratios, calculated on the basis of asf’s consolidated financial statements: net debt to cash flow
              from operations(*) ≤ 7 and cash flow from operations(*) to net financial costs ≥ 2.2;
              ˇˇ the prior conditions for any disposal by asf of shares it holds in escota, as defined in the credit line agreements signed on 18 december 2006
              with a bank syndicate by asf and asf holding of €3.5 billion and €1.2 billion respectively.

              vinci undertakes furthermore that vinci concessions will return to asf holding the sums that asf holding may have made available to it
              under group centralised cash management agreements, should asf holding be required to make early repayment of its syndicated loan of
              €1.2 billion; that it will maintain, directly or indirectly, a shareholding in asf giving it access to a majority of the share capital and voting rights.
              this commitment ended when asf holding increased its shareholding in asf so as to hold the majority of the share capital and voting rights
              directly.

              the parties also undertake, in the event of the sale of shares giving a third party a blocking minority in asf, to require that third party to sign
              the shareholders’ agreement beforehand.

              the shareholders’ agreement was to remain in force as long as any money remained due to the banks under asf holding’s syndicated loan.
              given that the syndicated loan was repaid in advance on 29 june 2012, the shareholders’ agreement ended on that date.

              vinci has not entered into any agreements other than this agreement that could have a material effect on its share price. however, it should
              be stated that the formation of companies by vinci with other parties may have resulted in agreements being made. this is the case in par-
              ticular for cofiroute, stade de france consortium and companies created specifically for the needs of securing and managing infrastructure
              concessions. the main purpose of these agreements is to organise the respective rights of shareholders in the event of the disposal of shares,
              and if applicable, to set certain operating principles for the corporate governing bodies.

      we were assisted in our work by our corporate social responsibility experts.

      nature and scope of our procedures
      we conducted our procedures in accordance with the international standard on assurance engagements (isae) 3000 and with professional
      standards applicable in france. we carried out the procedures below in order to provide limited assurance that the selected data identified
      by the symbol þ contains no material misstatement that would indicate that it is not fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance
      with the guidelines. a higher level of assurance would have required more extensive work.

      for the selected data, we performed the following procedures:
      ˇˇ we assessed the guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, neutrality, understandability, and reliability, taking into account
      best practices in the industry, if applicable.
      ˇˇ we verified that the group has implemented a data collection, compilation, processing and quality control process to ensure the complete-
      ness and consistency of the data. we reviewed the internal control and risk management procedures involved in the preparation of the data.
      ˇˇ we conducted interviews with the individuals in charge of social and environmental reporting and performed tests of details, on a sample
      basis, on the application of the guidelines in selected entities(*) (the “entities”).
      ˇˇ we carried out consistency tests with respect to the consolidation of the data.


      the entities accounted for 21% of the group’s employees and between 12% and 72% of the group’s environmental indicators.

      conclusion
      based on our procedures, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the data identified by the symbol þ has not been
      prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the guidelines.

      comments on the data
      we have the following comments to make on the environmental data:
      ˇˇ reporting processes and tools should be further strengthened for construction activities outside france.
      ˇˇ vinci construction france uses a statistical method to measure its consumption of water, electricity, fuel oil and heating oil. this method
      should be improved to increase the reliability of the results produced.

             give an account of the composition of the board of directors, the application of the principle of equal representation of men and women on
             the board, how the board’s work is prepared and organised, and the internal control and risk management procedures the vinci group has
             put in place.

             the “corporate governance” section of this report was submitted to the appointments and corporate governance committee.

             the “internal control and risk management procedures” section was prepared with the input of the vinci group’s business lines and divisions.
             the required information was gathered from key personnel responsible for internal audit and risk management procedures. this section of
             the report was submitted for approval to the audit committee.

             this report was approved by the board of directors at its meeting of 5 february 2013.



a.           corporate governance
1.           reference to the afep-medef code of corporate governance
             at its meeting of 13 november 2008, the board of directors of vinci decided that the company would, as from financial year 2008, use the
             afep-medef code as a frame of reference for preparing the report required by article l.225-37 of the french commercial code. this corporate
             governance code may be consulted in full on the medef website (www.medef.com). the following criteria or recommendations of this code
             have been set aside:

              criterion/recommendation set aside                                                 reason

                                                                                                 board members must have sufficient perspective on these activities. the individuals

2.           executive management structure
             on 6 may 2010, shareholders renewed mr huillard’s appointment as a member of the board. the board then decided to combine the functions
             of chairman of the board and chief executive officer. the board believed – and continues to believe – that this decision, announced in
             november 2009, represents the most appropriate choice for the group because i) its operational structure demands it, with executive
             management of a listed holding company supported by structured businesses, concessions and contracting, ii) it wanted to unify the group’s
             top-level representation vis-à-vis third parties so as to clarify it and make the group more responsive. the board believes that the group’s
             solid performance over the last two years, in a tough economic environment, has confirmed the soundness of its decision.

             chairman and chief executive officer
             xavier huillard, chairman and chief executive officer:
             ˇˇ organises and directs the work of the board and reports thereon to shareholders at the shareholders’ general meeting. he ensures the proper
             functioning of the various corporate bodies and committees and, in particular, ensures that the directors are able to fulfil their responsibilities;
             ˇˇ has the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the company’s name. he exercises these powers within the limits of the corporate
             purpose, subject to the powers that the law attributes expressly to shareholders and to the board of directors, and in accordance with the board’s
             internal rules. he represents the company in its dealings with third parties and is responsible for overall operational management of the group.

180                                           report of the chairman




      he provides the board and its committees with the information they need, reports on the highlights of the group’s operations over the period
      and implements the board’s decisions.

      the board’s internal rules require the company’s material transactions, referred to in paragraph 3.3 below, to be subject to prior approval by
      the board. in addition, the chairman and chief executive officer regularly presents the group’s performance, prospects and strategy to the
      financial community, in particular through road shows.

      mr huillard chairs the executive committee and the management and coordination committee. the executive committee had 13 members
      as of the date of this report. it met 22 times in 2012, with an average of two meetings per month. the management and coordination committee
      is composed of the members of the executive committee and the group’s main operational and functional executives. its purpose is to ensure
      broad consultation on vinci’s strategy and position as well as on cross-cutting policies within the vinci group. this committee has 35
      members and met four times in 2012.

      mr huillard also chairs the risk committee mentioned in paragraph 4.3 of part b with powers to delegate this function.

      vice-chairman and senior director of the board
      yves-thibault de silguy was named vice-chairman and senior director of the vinci board on 6 may 2010. mr de silguy was previously chairman
      of the board (from 2006 to 2010), and he proposed that the board change its system of corporate governance by creating a new senior director
      function with real prerogatives, set out in the board’s internal rules. the board approved his proposal unanimously. the senior director has an
      outstanding level of information about the group and how it operates and also enjoys specific powers that are specified in the board’s internal
      rules and restated in the report of the vice-chairman and senior director on page 194 of this report. these factors ensure the system’s
      efficiency. mr de silguy cannot be considered an “independent director” as defined by the afep-medef code because he held the position of
      chairman of the board between 2006 and 2010. nevertheless, the board considers that his exceptional knowledge of the group by virtue of
      his previous position, the information from which he will continue to benefit, as specified in the internal rules, and his availability constitute
      sufficient reason to assign the position to him. mr de silguy reports on his activity to the remuneration committee in the form of a detailed
      written report.

      mr de silguy:
      ˇˇ devotes part of his time to remaining up to the minute on the group’s news and events through regular meetings with the group’s principal
      operational and functional executives;
      ˇˇ assists the chairman and chief executive officer, as part of the company’s corporate governance arrangements, in organising the work of
      the board and its committees;
      ˇˇ provides the board with his insights on transactions it will have to consider, supplementing the activity of the board committees, and ensures
      the proper functioning of governance bodies on behalf of the board;
      ˇˇ calls a meeting of the directors once a year, without the chairman and chief executive officer being present.


      mr de silguy also chairs the appointments and corporate governance committee and the strategy and investments committee. he takes
      part in numerous meetings with individual shareholders.

      lastly, mr de silguy assists the chairman and chief executive officer and the executives of the group’s numerous subsidiaries, at their request,
      in high-level representation vis-à-vis governmental authorities and major customers and business partners in france and abroad. this support
      is governed by a services agreement approved by shareholders at the shareholders’ general meeting of 6 may 2010. the board of directors
      is careful to ensure that this contract does not give rise to a conflict of interest or weaken the role of senior director that has been separately
      assigned to mr de silguy. to this end, his remuneration is a fixed, non-adjustable sum and the agreement’s execution is reviewed every year
      by the audit committee, on the basis of a detailed written report. acting on the advice of the audit committee, which conducts an annual
      review of mr de silguy’s activity report, the board considers that the continuing performance of this agreement is useful for the group and
      that the remuneration paid is consistent with the services provided.



3.    the board of directors
3.1   composition of the board of directors – independence of members
      at the date of this document, the board of directors has 13 members, including one member representing employee shareholders.

      in 2012, shareholders renewed the term of jean-pierre lamoure as director. dominique bazy decided not to seek re-election to his position
      upon expiration of his term at the end of the shareholders’ general meeting of 12 april 2012.

      at the shareholders’ general meeting of 16 april 2013, shareholders will be asked to vote on the renewal of the term of michael pragnell as
      director and the appointment of two new directors. in addition, the terms of office of françois david and patrick faure will expire at the end
      of this annual shareholders’ general meeting.

      since the shareholders’ general meeting of 12 april 2012, the percentage of women on the board has been 15.4%. the board aims to comply,
      within the specified time frame, with law no. 2011-103 of 27 january 2011 concerning the balance between men and women on boards of
      directors and supervisory boards and concerning equal status for men and women. at the shareholders’ general meeting of 16 april 2013,
      shareholders will be asked to appoint ms yannick assouad and ms graziella gavezotti to the board of directors. approval of the corresponding
      resolution will lift the percentage of women on the board to 30.8%, thereby putting the board in early compliance with the law and the afep-
      medef code. furthermore, subject to approval of the resolutions on the renewal and appointment of directors by the shareholders’ general
      meeting, three of 13 board members will not have french citizenship.

vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the chairman                                                                              181




        the term of office of directors is four years. the directors’ terms of office expire at different times, such that approximately one-quarter of
        the board is renewed every year.

        the company’s articles of association provide that no one may be appointed or re-appointed as a director after reaching the age of 75 and
        that no more than one-third of the directors in office at the close of the financial year for which shareholders are asked to approve the financial
        statements may be over 70.

        at its meeting of 5 february 2013, the board also made an assessment of the current directors’ independence, as required by the afep-medef
        code and in accordance with the criteria of that code.

        for the purpose of evaluating the independence of vinci’s directors, the board decided to exclude the code’s 12-year seniority criterion for
        the reasons explained in paragraph a.1 above.

        although certain vinci board members may be customers or suppliers of companies having business relationships with the group, the board
        has determined that, given the business of the group and because business relationships between the companies in the group and their
        industrial partners are highly dispersed, there is no significant flow of business requiring special surveillance and that might give rise to conflicts
        of interest. concerning relationships with its partner banks, the board examined the individual situation of the director who has had respon-
        sibilities in the banking sector, and concluded that no conflict of interest has been identified over the last five years and that he has full
        independence of judgement.

        after receiving the report of the appointments and corporate governance committee, the board examined the situation of each board member
        and reached the following conclusions:

        directors who cannot be considered independent
        ˇˇ xavier huillard, chairman and chief executive officer;
        ˇˇ yves-thibault de silguy, vice-chairman and senior director. this evaluation is based on the fact that mr de silguy was chairman of the board
        of directors from 2006 to 2010 and that he holds a services contract with the company. the board has noted, however, that the execution and
        payment terms of this contract and the fact that mr de silguy is currently drawing a pension ensure that he has considerable independence
        of judgement;
        ˇˇ elisabeth boyer, director representing employee shareholders. this evaluation was based on the fact that ms boyer is an employee of
        cofiroute, a subsidiary of vinci. the board nevertheless noted that ms boyer is a member of an employee representative body, giving her
        protection that could enable her to be considered an independent director under the european commission recommendation 2005/162/
        ec of 5 february 2005;
        ˇˇ jean-pierre lamoure. this evaluation was based on the fact that mr lamoure was an employee of soletanche freyssinet, a wholly owned
        subsidiary of vinci. the board of directors has noted, however, that mr lamoure no longer performs any operational functions within the
        vinci group.

        directors who can be considered independent
        the board of directors believes that the following members of the board are independent. it believes that even if some of them do not meet
        certain criteria set out by the afep-medef code, the judgement of these individuals is completely independent, ensuring that they can carry
        out their remit in a fully independent manner.
        ˇˇ robert castaigne. the board has taken into account the fact that until may 2008 mr castaigne was chief financial officer and member of
        the executive committee of the total group, with which the vinci group has normal business relationships involving fuel purchase contracts
        or construction projects, for example. the board believes that these factors do not alter mr castaigne’s independence of judgement.
        ˇˇ françois david. mr david is chairman of coface. the board believes, however, that the normal commercial relationships that might exist
        between the coface group and the vinci group (e.g. insurance policies for contracts entered into by vinci subsidiaries abroad) do not alter
        mr david’s independence of judgement.
        ˇˇ patrick faure. the board noted that mr faure has been a director of vinci since 1993, i.e. more than 12 years, and that he sits on the board
        of cofiroute, a company controlled by vinci. the board believes, however, that mr faure’s directorship at cofiroute does not alter his inde-
        pendence of judgement. on the contrary, the board believes this constitutes an advantage inasmuch as mr faure has useful experience in
        motorway concessions from which the other members of the board can benefit.
        ˇˇ dominique ferrero. the board considers that mr ferrero no longer has an operational role within the natixis group. the board took into
        consideration mr ferrero’s statements, according to which his functions did not give rise to any conflict of interest in 2012.
        ˇˇ jean-bernard lévy. the board considers that the normal business relationships that exist between the thales group, of which mr lévy
        became the chairman and ceo on 20 december 2012, and certain vinci group companies do not alter mr lévy’s independence of judgement.
        ˇˇ michael pragnell held management responsibilities within syngenta ag until 2007. this company has no business relationship with the
        vinci group.
        ˇˇ henri saint olive. mr saint olive is chairman of banque saint olive, which might enter into transactions with the company or its subsidiaries
        or into private transactions with executives thereof. the board believes, however, that such transactions do not alter mr saint olive’s independ-
        ence of judgement.
        ˇˇ pascale sourisse. ms sourisse has management responsibilities within the thales group. the board believes, however, that the normal
        business relationships that may exist between the thales group and certain companies in the vinci group do not alter ms sourisse’s inde-
        pendence of judgement;
        ˇˇ qatari diar real estate investment company. the board noted that the qatari diar group held less than 6% of the share capital and voting
        rights of vinci, acquired when the cegelec group was sold to vinci. in addition, the board noted that vinci construction grands projets, a
        wholly owned subsidiary of vinci, and qatari diar are partners in the qatari-law company qatari diar vinci construction (qdvc). this company,
        51%-owned by qatari diar, is involved in developing construction activities in qatar and elsewhere in the middle east. abdul hamid janahi
        has been the permanent representative of qatari diar on the board of vinci since 29 november 2012. the board believes, however, that the
        information presented above does not affect mr hamid janahi’s independence of judgement as a member of the board of vinci.

182                                             report of the chairman




        as a result of this evaluation, the board of directors considers that nine of its 13 members, i.e. more than half, qualify as independent.

        the board has also examined the situations of ms yannick assouad and ms graziella gavezotti, whose appointments to the board will be
        proposed to shareholders at their general meeting on 16 april 2013, and considers that they meet all the criteria qualifying them as
        independent.

        in view of the expiry of the terms of mr david and mr faure, and if the two aforementioned candidates are appointed as directors by the
        shareholders’ general meeting, nine directors out of 13 can be considered at that point as independent.


3.2     personal situation of company officers
        as of the date this document was prepared and to the best of the chairman’s knowledge:
        ˇˇ there are no family links between any of vinci’s company officers;
        ˇˇ none of vinci’s company officers had been found guilty of fraud in the last five years;
        ˇˇ none of these individuals has been involved as a company officer in a bankruptcy, sequestration of assets or liquidation during the last five
        years and none has been incriminated or officially punished by a statutory or regulatory authority. none has been disqualified by a court from
        serving as a member of a board of directors or company management or supervisory body of a securities issuer, nor from being involved in
        the management or conduct of the affairs of a securities issuer in the last five years;
        ˇˇ no company officer of vinci had declared a conflict of interest in respect of any decisions taken by the board of directors in 2012.




3.3     the board of directors’ internal rules
        in may 2003, the board of directors adopted a set of internal rules. the most recent version came into effect on 6 may 2010 when the board
        decided to combine the functions of chairman and chief executive officer. this document specifies the rules applicable to the board and its
        committees, and it includes rules of ethics detailing the standard of conduct expected of each director. the internal rules may be consulted
        in full on the company’s website (www.vinci.com).

        the internal rules of the board of directors specifically require the board to examine and approve, prior to implementation:
        ˇˇ strategic transactions carried out by the company and, more generally, by the group;
        ˇˇ strategic investment projects and any transaction, in particular acquisitions and divestments, in excess of €200 million;
        ˇˇ transactions falling outside of the company’s announced strategy and any transaction brought to its attention by its strategy and investments
        committee.

        the internal rules of the board of directors also require that board members be kept informed at all times of the company’s financial condition,
        cash position and commitments, and of all significant events and transactions related to the company. they may request information about
        specific subjects and they may meet with the company’s principal executives, if necessary, whether or not the company officers are present,
        so long as the chairman is notified in advance.

        lastly, the internal rules specifically define the powers and prerogatives of the vice-chairman and senior director. these include the right to
        call a meeting of the board at any time and without a particular agenda, to add any item to the agenda, to call a meeting of the members of
        the board or to meet with the members of the executive committee without the chairman and chief executive officer being present.

3.4.2      the board committees
           the responsibilities and modus operandi of the committees are governed by the internal rules of the board of directors. each committee has
           a role to play in analysing and preparing the board discussions falling within its field of competence and in studying topics and/or projects
           that the board or its chairman may submit to it for review. it has consultative powers and acts under the authority of the board, of which it is
           an extension and to which it is accountable. minutes of each committee meeting are drawn up and circulated to the members of the board
           of directors.

           the audit committee
           terms of reference
           the audit committee helps the board monitor the accuracy and fair presentation of vinci’s parent company and consolidated financial state-

           ˇˇ the process of compiling financial information: examine the group’s annual and half-yearly parent company and consolidated financial state-
           ments before they are presented to the board, satisfy themselves that the accounting policies and methods are appropriate and consistently

      terms of reference
      this committee helps the board review the group’s overall strategy. it examines proposed strategic investments and all transactions, including

              ˇˇ determination of the variable portion of mr huillard’s remuneration for 2011;
              ˇˇ calculation of the annual amount to be set aside for mr huillard’s long-term incentive programme;

              the chairman and chief executive officer attended and participated in several committee meetings (except for items concerning him
              personally).

              the appointments and corporate governance committee
              terms of reference
              this committee:
              ˇˇ ensures adherence to corporate governance rules;
              ˇˇ prepares the board’s discussions on the assessment of the company’s executive management;
              ˇˇ examines, on a consultative basis, the executive management’s proposals relating to the appointment and dismissal of the group’s principal
              executives;
              ˇˇ is informed of the executive management’s policy for managing the group’s senior executives and in this regard, the committee examines

              ˇˇ makes proposals on the selection of directors;
              ˇˇ examines all candidacies for board membership and expresses an opinion or recommendation to the board on those candidacies;

              ˇˇ prepares, in a timely manner, recommendations and opinions on the appointment or succession to the posts of executive company officers.


              composition
              the appointments and corporate governance committee comprises at least three directors designated by the board. since 6 may 2010, it
              has been composed of yves-thibault de silguy (chairman), patrick faure and dominique ferrero. the board recognises two of the three
              members of the committee as independent.

              the chairman and chief executive officer attends the committee’s meetings except when it evaluates the executive management. the board
              secretary acts as secretary to the committee.

              activities in 2012
              the committee met four times in 2012, with an attendance rate of 100%.

              the committee:
              ˇˇ considered directors’ terms of office expiring in 2012 and 2013;
              ˇˇ hired an external consultant to find new directors;
              ˇˇ examined the percentage of women on the board and implementation of law no. 2011-103 of 27 january 2011 concerning the balance of
              men and women on boards of directors;
              ˇˇ performed an assessment of the executive management;
              ˇˇ assessed each board member with regard to the independence criteria of the afep-medef code and made proposals to the board;
              ˇˇ examined the report of the chairman of the board on corporate governance;
              ˇˇ examined the assessment of the group’s senior executives;
              ˇˇ examined the results of the executive review conducted in 2012.




3.5           assessment of the composition and functioning of the board of directors
              in application of the board of directors’ internal rules, each year, the agenda of one meeting includes a discussion on the functioning of the
              board with the aim of improving its effectiveness. in addition, a formal assessment is performed every three years. this exercise may be
              supervised by a director, with the assistance of an external consultant.

186                                           report of the chairman




      during its meeting of 7 february 2012, following the proposal of the appointments and corporate governance committee, the board of
      directors considered that it was not yet necessary to carry out another assessment because (i) the most recent formal assessment of the
      board had been performed at the end of 2010 with the help of an external consultant, and (ii) the board had considered this assessment in
      march and july 2011 and again in october 2011, following the meeting of committee chairmen on 20 september 2011, during which it was
      agreed that all the identified avenues for improvement had been acted upon. during its meeting of 5 february 2013, the board decided that
      an external assessment would be carried out in the second half of 2013.



4.	principles and rules for determining company officers’ remuneration and
    benefits of whatever nature
4.1   remuneration and benefits of the executive company officer
      the remuneration of the executive company officer is set by the board of directors, acting on a proposal from the remuneration committee.

      xavier huillard
      on 6 may 2010, the board of directors confirmed the decisions taken on 3 march 2010 concerning mr huillard’s remuneration and benefits
      from the time of his appointment as chairman and chief executive officer until the end of his term. during the meetings of 12 april 2012 and
      5 february 2013, the board set the following terms for his remuneration:
      ˇˇ fixed annual remuneration of €900,000, valid for the duration of xavier huillard’s term of office, it being specified that this remuneration
      only came into effect on 1 january 2011, at mr huillard’s request;
      ˇˇ a two-part variable remuneration plan, ranging from 0 to €1,440,000, or 0-160% of the fixed portion, depending on performance achieved.
      the first part is based on three economic ratios (net earnings per share, operating income per share and free cash flow). the second part
      is managerial and based on performance against qualitative criteria as defined by the board. for the first part, the quantitative target level
      expected to be achieved is linked to the specific method of the calculation formula, such that any increase in remuneration is dependent on
      an improvement in the performance ratios from one year to the next;
      ˇˇ a long-term incentive plan, allowing for a capital allowance to be built up gradually, variably, and based on specific performance objectives.
      except in certain specific cases, incentive plan awards will vest only if the beneficiary completes his term of office. under this incentive plan,
      an amount equivalent to (a) 16,600 times the value of the vinci share, provided that roce exceeds 6% (9% starting from the 2012 financial
      year), and (b) 41,500 times the increase in the vinci share price over a one-year period, provided that the vinci share outperforms a peer
      group comprising at least 10 european construction and infrastructure concession companies by at least 5%, is to be granted to mr huillard
      for each of the four years of his term of office. in the event of lesser performance, the amount of the annual allocation under (a) will be reduced
      and will be equal to zero if roce is less than 5% (8% starting from the 2012 financial year), and the allocation under (b) will be reduced to zero
      if the vinci share underperforms the peer group by more than 5%. starting from the 2013 financial year, the scope of calculation for roce
      will be restated to exclude the ana group;
      ˇˇ mr huillard is deemed to have the status of a senior executive, thereby entitling him to benefit from the additional supplementary pension
      plan established for senior executives of vinci sa and mentioned in paragraph d.3.2 of the report of the board of directors, page 133, as well
      as from the group’s welfare benefits plans. the commitment with regard to the supplementary pension plan was approved by shareholders
      at the 6 may 2010 shareholders’ general meeting and the benefit of this supplementary pension plan was taken into account in determining
      mr huillard’s overall remuneration;
      ˇˇ mr huillard is eligible for severance pay in the event that the company terminates his appointment as director prior to its normal expiry (at
      the end of the shareholders’ general meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ending 31 december 2013). this com-
      mitment is limited to 24 months of his remuneration and subject to performance conditions based on the same criteria as those used in the
      calculation of the quantitative part of his variable remuneration. severance pay shall be equal to 24 months if average performance is at least
      equal to 130% of the objective and nil if average performance is less than or equal to 70% of the objective. this commitment was approved
      by shareholders at the 6 may 2010 shareholders’ general meeting.

      mr huillard has not benefited from the share subscription options and performance shares incentive plan approved by the board of directors
      at its meeting of 12 april 2012.


4.2   remuneration and benefits of the vice-chairman and senior director
      the remuneration of the vice-chairman and senior director is set by the board of directors, acting on a proposal by the remuneration
      committee.

      yves-thibault de silguy
      mr de silguy receives directors’ fees in his capacity as vice-chairman and senior director, calculated as described in paragraph 4.3.

      on 3 march 2010, the company signed a services agreement with ytseuropaconsultants, of which mr de silguy is the sole shareholder. this
      agreement was authorised by the board of directors and approved by shareholders at the 6 may 2010 shareholders’ general meeting. the
      agreement covers the provision of services as described in paragraph a.2 on page 180, with oversight by the audit committee, in return for
      an annual flat fee of €330,000 (ex. vat) and has a duration of one year, renewable automatically. this agreement was renewed automatically
      in 2011 and 2012 for a new term of one year.

      at its meeting of 5 february 2013, the board of directors decided to seek approval for the automatic renewal of this agreement from the
      shareholders’ general meeting.

      in addition, it should be noted that mr de silguy is the beneficiary of a supplementary pension plan and that he activated his pension rights
      as of 30 april 2010. vinci’s commitment under this pension totalled €8,000,169 at 31 december 2012.

4.3           directors’ fees
              at the shareholders’ general meeting of 6 may 2010, shareholders set the aggregate amount of directors’ fees at €920,000 for each financial
              year, starting on 1 january 2010.

              in its meetings of 27 february 2008 and 3 march 2010, the board of directors agreed on the following allocation of directors’ fees (amounts
              expressed on an annualised basis):
              ˇˇ the chairman and chief executive officer receives no directors’ fees from the company;
              ˇˇ the vice-chairman and senior director receives €140,000, of which €30,000 is variable and depends on his presence at board meetings;
              ˇˇ other directors receive €40,000 each, of which €20,000 is variable and depends on their presence at board meetings;
              ˇˇ the chairman of each committee receives €25,000, the members of the audit committee receive €15,000 and the members of the other
              committees receive €10,000, in addition to the directors’ fees mentioned above.

              payment of the variable fee is dependent on the member’s attendance at board meetings. the variable fee is reduced by €2,500 per meeting
              for any board member who misses two or more meetings.



5.	formalities for participation of shareholders in the shareholders’ general meeting
              the formalities for shareholders to participate in the shareholders’ general meeting are described in article 17 of the articles of association
              and reproduced below:

              article 17 - shareholders’ general meetings

b.    internal control and risk management procedures
1.    introduction
1.1   definitions and reference framework
      in july 2010, the french stock market regulator, the autorité des marchés financiers (amf), published the findings of the working group formed
      under its aegis. this document is entitled “risk management and internal control systems: reference framework”.
      the vinci group uses this document as its reference framework.

      the risk management and internal control systems participate in a complementary manner in keeping control over the group’s business.
      “risk” is the possibility that an event might take place with consequences that would adversely affect the objectives of the group and in
      particular those related to its financial condition and reputation.

      the risk management system aims to identify and analyse the principal risks that the group’s subsidiaries encounter. “internal control”
      encompasses all the controls to best handle these risks.
      risk management is therefore a set of resources, conduct, procedures and initiatives that correspond to the characteristics of the vinci
      group’s businesses and maintain risk at an acceptable level.
      vinci’s risk management system is a management tool to be used by each company in the group to help:
      ˇˇ create and preserve value, assets and the company’s reputation;
      ˇˇ secure the company’s decision-making procedures and other processes so as to increase the likelihood of achieving objectives;
      ˇˇ ensure that initiatives are in line with the company’s values;
      ˇˇ foster a shared view of the principal risks among employees of the company.


      the internal control system aims more particularly to ensure:
      ˇˇ that the instructions and guidelines set by the executive management are implemented;
      ˇˇ that laws and regulations are complied with;
      ˇˇ that the internal processes function correctly, notably those contributing to the safeguarding of its assets;
      ˇˇ that financial reporting is reliable.


      the internal control system is a set of resources, procedures, conduct and initiatives that correspond to the characteristics of the vinci group’s
      businesses and which:
      ˇˇ helps the businesses run smoothly and contributes to effective operations and efficient use of resources;
      ˇˇ must enable significant risks to be taken into account in an appropriate manner, whether they are operational, financial or legal.


      nevertheless, like any set of controls, however well designed and implemented the internal control system may be, it cannot provide an
      absolute guarantee that the group will achieve its objectives.


1.2   scope of risk management and internal control
      in addition to managing a system specific to vinci holding, the group also ensures that there are risk management and internal control
      systems in place at each of its component businesses. these systems apply to fully consolidated entities, a list of which can be found in
      chapter j of the notes to the consolidated financial statements (page 268).

      for the specific case of the listed belgian company cfe (in which vinci has a 46.84% capital stake) and its subsidiaries, the provisions in force
      are adapted to the specific features of belgian law, which attributes responsibility for risk management and internal control to the board of
      directors of companies listed on the stock exchange.


2.    environment and organisation
2.1   principles of action and conduct
      the businesses in which vinci operates require the personnel involved to be geographically close to customers in order to ensure the prompt
      delivery of solutions that are suited to their needs. to enable the manager of each business unit – around 3,500 in total in the group – to take
      the required operational decisions rapidly, a decentralised organisation has been implemented in each business (concessions and contracting),
      business line and division, as well as in vinci immobilier.
      consequently, the group has implemented appropriate delegation of authority and responsibility to operational and functional staff at all
      levels. the delegation of authority to these staff is carried out in compliance with the general guidelines (see paragraph 4.2) and the principles
      of action and conduct to which vinci is strongly committed:
      ˇˇ strict compliance with the rules common to the whole group in respect of commitments, risk-taking (see paragraph 4.3), acceptance of
      contracts (see paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5), and reporting of financial, accounting and management information (see paragraph 4.2). these com-
      mon rules, which are deliberately restricted in number given the broad spectrum of the group’s activities, must be strictly applied by the
      staff concerned and their teams;
      ˇˇ transparency and loyalty of managers towards their line management superiors and towards the functional departments of the business
      lines and the holding company. in particular, managers are required to inform their superiors of any significant difficulties encountered in the
      performance of their duties (e.g. with respect to carrying out work on sites; relations with customers, government departments, suppliers and
      financial partners; internal relations, personnel management, safety, etc.). an integral part of operational managers’ duties is to take decisions
      alone on matters falling within their area of competence, within the framework of the general guidelines they have received and accepted.

      vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the chairman                                                                            189




              nevertheless, any significant difficulties encountered must be handled with the assistance, as necessary, of their line management superiors
              or the functional departments of the business lines and the vinci holding company;
              ˇˇ compliance with the laws and regulations in force in the countries where the group operates;
              ˇˇ adherence to the code of ethics and conduct;
              ˇˇ responsibility of operational executive managers to communicate the group’s principles governing action and conduct to their staff by
              appropriate means and to set a good example. this responsibility cannot be delegated;
              ˇˇ health and safety of individuals (employees, external service providers, subcontractors, etc.);
              ˇˇ a culture of financial performance.




2.2           participants in the risk management and internal control processes
              everyone in the organisation plays a role in risk management and internal control, from the governing bodies to the employees of each group
              subsidiary.

              vinci’s board of directors represents all the shareholders collectively and is responsible for monitoring the executive management perfor-
              mance, defining the group’s strategic choices and ensuring that it functions properly. it considers all major matters concerning the group’s
              business. in its report, the board gives an account of the principal risks and uncertainties the group faces.

              in 2003, the board adopted a set of internal rules and created several specialised committees: audit, strategy and investment, remuneration,
              and appointments and corporate governance. it delegated to the audit committee responsibility for the monitoring of assignments defined
              by the 8 december 2008 order transposing the european directive on statutory auditing into french law. the principal activities carried out
              in 2012 in this regard can be found in part a of the report of the chairman of the board (page 179). they are in line with the recommendations
              of the amf working group on audit committees (dated july 2010).

              the executive committee, composed of 13 members at the time of writing of this report (see page 14), is in charge of implementing the
              group’s strategy, defining the monitoring of the enforcement of its management policies (risk management, finance, human resources, safety,
              insurance, etc).

              the holding company functions with a streamlined staff (213 people at 31 december 2012), suited to the group’s highly decentralised
              structure. the holding company’s functional departments ensure that the group’s rules and procedures as well as the executive management’s
              decisions are correctly enforced. furthermore, and depending on the needs that are expressed, these departments advise business lines on
              technical matters but do not interfere with operational decisions, which are the sole responsibility of the business lines.

              the ethics officer ensures, in liaison with the operational and functional departments, that the code of ethics and conduct is properly
              understood throughout the group. any employee encountering difficulties or who has questions about the scope or application of the rules
              may contact the ethics officer directly and in total confidentiality.

              the audit department has a three-part role.
              ˇˇ concerning risk management: based on guidelines from the executive management, it plays a leading role in deploying and implementing
              a structured, permanent and adaptable system, making it possible to identify, analyse and handle the principal risks. the audit department
              coordinates the risk management system by giving methodological support to the subsidiaries’ operational and functional departments.
              it organises the meetings of the vinci risk committee, which reviews and authorises new contracts exceeding certain thresholds set by
              executive management or presenting particular technical or financial risks.
              ˇˇ concerning internal control: in addition to drafting and disseminating the general internal control procedures set by the holding company,
              the audit department organises the annual self-assessment survey on the internal control of the group’s subsidiaries.
              ˇˇ concerning auditing: it carries out its own assignments, in support of the work performed by the business lines and by the members of the
              holding company’s functional departments, depending on their areas of expertise.

              the business lines carry out their activities based on the principles of action and conduct described in paragraph 2.1. in this regard, they
              implement and supervise risk management and internal control systems suited to their business.



3.            risk management system
              “risks” are defined as obstacles that might prevent the company from achieving its objectives. these objectives may be strategic (commit-
              ments), operational, financial, or in relation to compliance with laws and regulations.

              the group applies the policies set by the executive committee. these policies aim to comply with the legal requirements and to ensure that
              risks are monitored in a more formalised, systematic and uniform manner. this plan involves operational managers, but without complicating
              operating methods. risk monitoring is an integral part of the existing procedures related to commitments and periodic monitoring of
              operations.

              a risk-mapping process encompassing all the group’s activities was created in 2009 and is updated periodically as follows, in accordance
              with the amf’s recommendations:
              ˇˇ anticipation of the main identifiable risks, either internal or external, that represent obstacles to the achievement of the company’s objectives;
              ˇˇ a qualitative assessment of risk criticality, taking into account the impact, likelihood and degree of control of each element of risk.


              this procedure has been applied to identify, assess and select the major risks threatening the various components of the group: holding
              company, concessions, contracting, and property. these risks are described in the chapter entitled “risk factors”, on page 120 of the report
              of the board of directors.

190                                            report of the chairman




      risk mapping makes it possible to apply a specific procedure to each type of risk, which can be assessed using the coordination indicators.
      risk scorecards are created from the mapping system specific to each business (concessions, contracting). the scorecards are used during
      risk committee meetings to present and assess, in a uniform manner, the most significant events that might affect the project under review.



4.    internal control system
      the main procedures described below are common to all companies in the group. there are specific procedures within each business line, in
      particular for the monitoring of projects and forecasting of results, especially for contracts spanning several years.


4.1   compliance with laws and regulations
      the group’s compliance objectives encompass the standards of conduct set by the laws and regulations in force.

      the legal department of the holding company is responsible for:
      ˇˇ maintaining a legislative watch related to the various applicable rules;
      ˇˇ informing employees about rules pertaining to them;
      ˇˇ monitoring major acquisition projects and disputes.


      documentation has been distributed and a variety of training and awareness sessions held in this regard, so as to prevent any infraction or
      fraud.

      as indicated in the first part of the sustainable development section on pages 18–29 of this report, particular emphasis is placed on:
      ˇˇ safety of employees on construction sites through active implementation of the group’s accident prevention policy;
      ˇˇ purchasing and subcontracting.




4.2   application of the guidelines and instructions of the executive management
      the chairmen of the companies heading business lines in the contracting business (vinci energies, eurovia and vinci construction), the
      chairman of vinci autoroutes, the chief executive officer of vinci concessions and the chairman of vinci immobilier exercise the powers
      given to them by law.

      under the group’s internal organisation, they are also required to comply with the general guidelines issued for them by vinci’s chairman
      and chief executive officer.

      these apply to the following areas:
      ˇˇ adherence to the code of ethics and conduct;
      ˇˇ entering into commitments, and in particular bidding for new contracts that are complex, of a significant size or involve significant potential
      risks; acquisitions and disposals; property transactions; and material off-balance sheet commitments;
      ˇˇ reporting to the holding company of accounting and financial information or information relating to events that are material for the group,
      in respect of safety, litigation, disputes, and insurance policies and claims.

      these general guidelines require compliance with the holding company’s procedures regarding bidding or investments. these procedures
      define thresholds above which specific authorisation must be obtained from the appropriate committees, namely the risk committee (see
      paragraph 4.3) or the board of directors’ strategy and investment committee, or where prior notifications must be issued to the chairman
      and chief executive officer and/or to certain vinci functional departments.

      these guidelines are cascaded through the organisation by the heads of the business lines:
      ˇˇ via delegations to their operational and functional staff for the provisions concerning them;
      ˇˇ to managers serving as company officers in a company in their business sector.




4.3   procedures related to new commitments – the vinci risk committee
      strict control procedures are in force that must be complied with before a new commitment is accepted.

      the role of the vinci risk committee is to assess:
      ˇˇ acquisitions and disposals of businesses;
      ˇˇ the terms and conditions of tenders for construction works which, by virtue of their scale, specific financing characteristics, location or
      technical characteristics, entail specific risks of a technical, legal, financial or other nature. the thresholds for automatic prior review and vetting
      by the risk committee are defined in the general guidelines. they apply to the entire project, taking all works packages together, irrespective
      of the group’s share in the project or the manner in which contracts are awarded (call for tenders, direct contracts, etc.);
      ˇˇ all transactions relating to property development, public-private partnerships (ppps), concession operations or long-term commitments,
      including all associated financing, whether in france or elsewhere.

      thresholds below those necessitating a review by the risk committee require that an information sheet be sent to vinci’s executive
      management. a risk committee meeting may be convened, as needed.

      vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the chairman                                                                           191




              risk committee meetings are usually attended by the following members:
              ˇˇ the chairman and chief executive officer of vinci and/or the executive vice-president, contracting;
              ˇˇ the chairman (or chief executive officer) of the business line involved;
              ˇˇ the executive vice-president and chief financial officer of the group;
              ˇˇ the chief audit officer;
              ˇˇ the operational representatives of the entity presenting the project (chief executive officer, project manager, etc.);
              ˇˇ the functional representatives of the entity involved (legal, insurance, finance, etc.).


              the composition of the risk committee may be adjusted as a function of its agenda (e.g. review of property transactions, acquisitions of
              companies, construction contracts, concession contracts and ppps).

              the vinci risk committee, in its various configurations, met 251 times in 2012 and reviewed 308 projects.


4.4           procedures related to monitoring of operations
              the business lines have their own operational control systems, which are tailored to their business. specific budget control measures have
              been implemented by vinci energies, eurovia and vinci construction and by each of the concession activities (motorways, car parks, etc.).
              they make it possible to regularly monitor the progress of projects and contracts. these systems are compatible with those used to prepare
              and process financial and accounting information as described below.

              monthly dashboard reports on business, new orders, the order book and the group’s consolidated net borrowing position are prepared by the
              finance department on the basis of detailed information provided by the business lines.

              each main entity’s executive management prepares a monthly report on key events.

              the budget procedure is common to all group business lines and their subsidiaries. it is built around five key dates in the year: the initial budget
              for the next year at the end of the current year, followed by four updates in march, may, september and november. management committees
              meet twice a year to examine each business line’s performance and financial data. the chairman and chief executive officer, and the executive
              vice-president and chief financial officer of vinci attend these meetings.

              lastly, the business lines participate in regular monitoring of vinci’s social and environmental responsibility commitments as indicated in the
              first part of the sustainable development section on pages 18–29 of this report, with a particular emphasis on safety.


4.5 	procedures related to the preparation and processing
      of financial and accounting information
              the budgets and consolidation department, reporting to the finance department, is responsible for the integrity and reliability of vinci’s
              financial information (parent company and consolidated financial statements), which is disseminated inside and outside the group. to ensure
              the statements are produced, the department is specifically in charge of:
              ˇˇ preparing, approving and analysing vinci’s half-year and annual parent company and consolidated financial statements and forecasts;
              ˇˇ establishing, disseminating and monitoring the group’s accounting procedures and checking their compliance with the accounting standards
              in force, as well as ensuring that significant transactions are recognised correctly from an accounting standpoint;
              ˇˇ coordinating “vision”, the group’s financial information system, which includes the consolidation process and unifies vinci’s various
              reporting systems.

              the budgets and consolidation department establishes the timetable and closure instructions for the preparation of the half-year and annual
              accounts and disseminates these in the business lines.

              the group’s accounting rules and methods are available on vinci’s corporate intranet. at each accounts closure, business lines transmit a
              package to the budgets and consolidation department containing an analysis of the consolidated data submitted and comments thereon.
              the group and the cfos of the business lines review the principal options and accounting estimates in liaison with the statutory auditors.

              the statutory auditors present their observations, if any, on the half-year and annual accounts to the audit committee before they are pre-
              sented to the board of directors.

              before signing their reports, the statutory auditors request representation letters from group management and management of the business
              lines. in these representations, group management and management of the business lines confirm that to the best of their knowledge, all
              items at their disposal have been submitted to the statutory auditors so as to enable them to perform their duties and that any anomalies
              noted by the statutory auditors and still unresolved at the date of these representations do not have a material impact, either individually or
              in aggregate, on the financial statements taken as a whole.

5.	actions undertaken to strengthen risk management and internal control
5.1   tasks carried out prior to 2012
      in 2003, vinci initiated an action plan intended to enhance the quality of the group’s risk management and internal control systems without
      calling into question the principles and features of its decentralised management organisation. these actions included, in particular:

      assessment of internal control
      annual self-assessment surveys to measure the quality of internal control, in accordance with the requirements of the french financial security
      act, covered an ever-increasing number of group entities, rising from 193 in 2005 to 370 in 2011.

      information systems
      surveys to assess the operation of information systems were carried out in 2006, 2008 (13 entities in metropolitan france, building a repre-
      sentative sample) and 2009 (33 subsidiaries based outside metropolitan france).

      in 2011, a working group, assisted by an external consultancy, prepared a report on the adequacy of the information systems used by vinci’s
      different business lines with respect to the group’s objectives. the report is based on the results of a survey of vinci’s component entities.

      the code of ethics and conduct, previously disseminated via the corporate hierarchy, was made available to all employees on the group intranet
      on 1 february 2011.

      in 2011, in line with its objectives, vinci implemented its fast close procedure, aimed at closing and publishing its financial statements at
      the beginning of february, representing a one-month gain on its previous publication schedule.


5.2   tasks carried out in 2012
      the annual self-assessment survey of internal control quality in the vinci group was carried out on 472 legal entities in 2012 (including 110
      outside france), representing 84% of the group’s consolidated business. the questionnaire contained 58 questions. apart from the recurrent
      topics related to the internal control system and to financial and accounting information, the annual topic in 2012 related to purchasing and
      subcontracting. the survey was conducted using specialised software that also enables entities to manage their action plans. the report
      prepared by the holding company’s audit department was presented to vinci’s executive committee and then to the audit committee in
      december. as in 2011, a specific questionnaire was sent to the chairman and chief executive officer covering matters related to his
      functions.
      with regard to information systems, vinci’s executive committee considered that a more effective flow of communication within the group
      was essential to achieving current and future objectives and therefore initiated developments that were carried out in 2012 in the following
      areas:
      ˇˇ interoperability of group networks;
      ˇˇ redesign of vinci’s intranet and launch of version 2.0 based on a collaborative approach.


      the fast close procedure was applied to the half-year financial statements published at the end of july.

      each group component prepared a report summarising the specific actions carried out in 2012. the reports, which in particular give an account
      of the audits and reviews carried out, did not reveal any significant problems.
      in addition, vinci’s audit department carried out audits in each of the following business lines: vinci concessions, eurovia, vinci energies
      and vinci construction.
      these audits did not reveal any problems that might have a significant impact on the business or financial statements of the group.


5.3   work to be done in 2013 and beyond
      vinci aims to continue improving the organisation of internal control within the group, while maintaining a streamlined chain of command,
      both at the holding company and business line levels.
      in addition to the annual internal control self-assessment survey, a self-assessment campaign on information systems was started in early
      2013.

      the interoperability programme for messaging networks, launched in 2012, is also under way.

      other areas for improvement include:
      ˇˇ continued deployment of common management tools;
      ˇˇ continued integration of acquired entities.

report of the vice-chairman and senior director
of the board of directors
      the vice-chairman and senior director of the vinci board of directors hereby reports on the role and responsibilities that were assigned to
      him in this capacity during the 2012 financial year.

      this report was prepared by the vice-chairman in liaison with the company’s legal department and was submitted to the remuneration
      committee and to the appointments and corporate governance committee before being presented to the vinci board of directors at its
      meeting on 5 february 2013.



1.    terms of reference for the vice-chairman and senior director
      the terms of reference for the vice-chairman and senior director are described as follows in article 2.3.2 of the internal rules of the board of
      directors, which are also available on the company’s website (www.vinci.com):

      “the vice-chairman is the senior director of the board. the vice-chairman assists the chairman with his duties, notably the organisation and
      proper functioning of the board and its committees and the supervision of corporate governance and internal control.

      “the vice-chairman also assists the board in ensuring the proper functioning of the company’s governance bodies and provides the board
      with his insight on the transactions the board is called to approve.

      “he holds a meeting with the directors once a year, in the absence of the executive company officers.

      “the chairman and chief executive officer keeps the vice-chairman informed of material events or situations affecting the group, notably
      relating to strategy, organisation, financial reporting, significant investment and divestment projects, major financial transactions, changes to
      the company’s share capital and contacts with the company’s main current or potential shareholders.

      “in order to carry out his role and responsibilities, the vice-chairman has direct access to the members of the group’s executive committee.
      in coordination with the chairman and chief executive officer, the vice-chairman may organise any meeting with executives and employees
      designated by them that he deems appropriate or useful to the performance of his duties. the vice-chairman may consult with the managers
      responsible for internal control, risk and compliance or the statutory auditors and may access any document or information that he deems
      necessary for the performance of his duties.

      “the chairman and chief executive officer facilitates the performance of these duties by providing the required instructions.”



   activities of the vice-chairman and senior director in the performance of
2.	
   the duties assigned to him by the board of directors
      during the financial year 2012, the vice-chairman and senior director participated in all nine board meetings. he chaired all four meetings
      of the appointments and corporate governance committee and all five meetings of the strategy and investment committee.

      in addition, the vice-chairman and senior director kept up to date on group events by meeting very regularly with the chairman and chief executive
      officer, the executive vice-president and chief financial officer, the heads of the business lines, the other members of the executive committee,
      the senior vice-president, corporate controlling and accounting department, a number of other group managers and the statutory auditors.

      he participated in the group’s management convention in june 2012 and visited numerous worksites in france and abroad.

      he also reviewed the documents produced for audit committee meetings as well as management reporting documents prepared regularly
      by the finance department.
      the vice-chairman and senior director devoted the equivalent of around 36 full working days to these meetings in 2012.

      the vice-chairman and senior director maintained frequent contact with each board member and met with each of them individually in 2012.

      he sent a detailed written report about the execution of his duties to the remuneration committee.

      he called and chaired a meeting of board members, without the chairman and chief executive officer being present, so as to evaluate the
      executive management.

      with the help of a firm of consultants, he interviewed candidates for the position of board member prior to their presentation to shareholders
      at the shareholders’ general meeting.

      lastly, the vice-chairman and senior director presented his report on financial year 2011 to shareholders at the 12 april 2012 shareholders’
      general meeting.

      as a result of his work, the vice-chairman and senior director concluded that the governing bodies functioned normally. board meeting
      agendas were communicated to him for his opinion before invitations were sent out to board members, and he did not request the inclusion
      of any additional items. consequently, he did not deem it necessary to call a board meeting pursuant to article 3.1 of the board’s internal rules.

202                                                        consolidated financial statements




a.    accounting policies and measurement methods
1.    general policies
      pursuant to regulation (ec) no. 1606/2002 of 19 july 2002, vinci’s consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 december 2012
      have been prepared under the international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the european union at 31 december 2012 (*).

      the accounting policies used at 31 december 2012 are the same as those used in preparing the consolidated financial statements at
      31 december 2011, except for the standards and interpretations adopted by the european union applicable as from 1 january 2012, (see
      note a.1.1. “new standards and interpretations applicable from 1 january 2012”).

      the information relating to 2010, presented in the 2011 registration document d.12-0108 filed with the amf on 27 february 2012, is deemed
      to be included herein.

      the consolidated financial statements were adopted by the board of directors on 5 february 2013 and will be submitted to the shareholders’
      general meeting for approval on 16 april 2013.


1.1   new standards and interpretations applicable from 1 january 2012
      the new standards and interpretations applicable from 1 january 2012 have no material impact on vinci’s consolidated financial statements
      at 31 december 2012. these are mainly:
      ˇˇ amendment to ifrs 7 “disclosures – transfers of financial assets”.
      ˇˇ ias 12 amended “deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets”.




1.2   standards and interpretations adopted by the iasb but not yet applicable
      at 31 december 2012
      the group has not applied early the following standards and interpretations of which application was not mandatory at 1 january 2012.
      standards on consolidation methods:
      ˇˇ ifrs 10 “consolidated financial statements”;
      ˇˇ ifrs 11 “joint arrangements”;
      ˇˇ ifrs 12 “disclosure of interests in other entities”;
      ˇˇ ias 27 revised “consolidated and separate financial statements”;
      ˇˇ ias 28 revised “interests in associates and joint ventures”.
      other standards:
      ˇˇ ias 1 amended “presentation of items of other comprehensive income”;
      ˇˇ ias 19 amended “employee benefits”;
      ˇˇ ifrs 7 amended “disclosures – offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities”;
      ˇˇ ifrs 13 “fair value measurement”;
      ˇˇ ias 32 amended: “offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities”;
      ˇˇ ifric 20 “stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine”.


      vinci is currently analysing the impacts and practical consequences of the application of these standards and interpretations.

      the amended version of ias 19 “employee benefits” must be applied to accounting periods starting on or after 1 january 2013. it features
      several changes in the way that post-employment benefits are recognised, including the following:
      ˇˇ all post-employment benefits granted to group employees must be recognised in the consolidated balance sheet. the corridor method
      and the ability to amortise past service cost against income over the average vesting period will no longer be possible (see note a.3.27.1
      “provisions for retirement benefit obligations”);
      ˇˇ calculating the expected return on pension plan assets will now involve the discount rate used for calculating obligations with respect to
      defined benefit plans;
      ˇˇ the impacts of plan amendments must be recognised in income;
      ˇˇ impacts of remeasurements must be recognised in other comprehensive income: actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit obliga-
      tions, plan asset outperformance/underperformance (i.e. the difference between the effective return on plan assets and the return calculated
      using the discount rate applied to the actuarial liability) and changes in the asset ceiling effect.

      the new arrangements resulting from the revised version of ias 19 will be applied retrospectively by the group. the main impacts on the
      group’s consolidated balance sheets at 1 january 2012 and 31 december 2012 are estimated as follows and correspond to the recognition
      of actuarial gains and losses and past service costs that were previously not recognised:
      ˇˇ an increase in provisions for retirement benefit obligations totalling €163 million at 1 january 2012 and €325 million at 31 december 2012;
      ˇˇ a decrease in assets recognised in the balance sheet totalling €49 million at 1 january 2012 and €69 million at 31 december 2012;
      ˇˇ a decrease in consolidated equity, excluding tax effects, totalling €212 million at 1 january 2012 and €394 million at 31 december 2012.


      a detailed analysis of the impact of the amended version of ias 19 on the 2012 consolidated financial statements is underway.

2.            consolidation methods
2.1           consolidation scope and methods
              companies in which the group holds, whether directly or indirectly, the majority of voting rights enabling control to be exercised, are fully
              consolidated. companies that are less than 50% owned but in which vinci exercises de facto control – i.e. has the power to govern the financial
              and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities – are consolidated using this same method. this relates mainly
              to cfe, a belgian construction group quoted on the brussels stock market, of which vinci owns 46.84% and over which it has de facto control
              in view in particular of the widely held nature of that company’s shareholder register.

              jointly controlled operations and assets are recognised on the basis of the group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses. this
              relates mainly to construction operations carried out in partnership, in the form of consortia or joint ventures, in the contracting business and
              at vinci immobilier.

              companies over which the group exercises significant influence and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method.

              when determining its level of control over an entity, vinci also analyses any instruments held by the group or by third parties which, if exer-
              cised, could cause the group to obtain or lose control of the entity concerned.

              vinci’s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all companies with revenue of more than €2 million, and of
              companies whose revenue is below this figure but whose impact on the group’s financial statements is material.

               total                                                     2,350           1,282           1,068           2,246           1,263             983

              the main changes in the period relate to the acquisition of the carmacks group in alberta, canada (six companies) and napc in india (one
              company) by eurovia in the first half of 2012, and of ga gruppe in germany (14 companies plus a newly created holding company) by
              vinci energies in the second half of 2012.
              gefyra, which holds the concession for the rion–antirion bridge in greece and was fully consolidated until 1 october 2012, has since that
              date been accounted for under the equity method after a change in the group’s ability to exert sole control over the company.
              the increase in the number of consolidated companies is mainly the result of changes to vinci energies’ operational organisation during the
              year. this led to the creation of 41 companies and the combination of eight others within vinci energies france. other acquisitions during the
              period mainly concerned vinci concessions (four companies), vinci energies (17 companies), vinci construction (11 companies) and eurovia
              (four companies).


2.2           intragroup transactions
              reciprocal operations and transactions relating to assets and liabilities, income and expenses between companies that are consolidated or
              accounted for under the equity method are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. this is done:
              ˇˇ for the full amount if the transaction is between two controlled subsidiaries;
              ˇˇ applying the percentage owned of a company accounted for under the equity method in the case of profits or losses realised between a
              controlled company and a company accounted for under the equity method.


2.3           translation of the financial statements of foreign companies and establishments
              in most cases, the functional currency of companies and establishments is their local currency.
              the financial statements of foreign companies of which the functional currency is different from that used in preparing the group’s consoli-
              dated financial statements are translated at the closing rate for balance sheet items and at the average rate for the period for income statement
              items. any resulting translation differences are recognised under translation differences in consolidated reserves. goodwill relating to foreign
              entities is considered as comprising part of the assets and liabilities acquired and is therefore translated at the exchange rate in force at the
              balance sheet date.


2.4           foreign currency transactions
              transactions in foreign currency are translated into euros at the exchange rate at the transaction date. at the balance sheet date, financial
              assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. resulting exchange gains and losses are
              recognised under foreign exchange gains and losses and are shown under other financial income and other financial expense in the income
              statement.
              foreign exchange gains and losses arising on loans denominated in foreign currency or on foreign currency derivative instruments qualifying
              as hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries, are recorded under currency translation differences in equity.

204                                            consolidated financial statements




2.5   business combinations
      business combinations completed between 1 january 2004 and 31 december 2009 were recognised applying the provisions of the previous
      version of ifrs 3.
      business combinations completed from 1 january 2010 onwards have been recognised in accordance with ifrs 3 revised. this standard has
      been applied prospectively. it has therefore not affected business combinations made before 1 january 2010.
      in application of this revised standard, the group recognises the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at their fair value at the dates when
      control was acquired. the cost of a business combination is the fair value, at the date of exchange, of the assets given, liabilities assumed, and/
      or equity instruments issued by the acquirer in exchange for control of the acquiree. contingent price adjustments are measured at fair value
      at each balance sheet date. after 12 months have elapsed from the acquisition date, any subsequent changes to this fair value are recognised
      in profit or loss.
      expenses that are directly attributable to the acquisition, such as professional fees for due diligence and other related fees, are expensed as
      they are incurred.
      non-controlling interests in the acquiree are measured either at their share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets, or at their fair value. this
      option is applied on a case-by-case basis for each acquisition.
      the cost of acquisition is allocated by recognising the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at their fair value at that date, except
      for assets or asset groups classified as held for sale under ifrs 5, which are recognised at their fair value less costs to sell. the positive differ-
      ence between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired constitute goodwill. where applicable,
      the cost of acquisition can include the fair value of non-controlling interests if the full goodwill method has been selected.
      the group has 12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the accounting for business combinations.
      in the case of a business combination achieved in stages, previously acquired shareholdings in the acquiree are measured at fair value at the
      date of acquisition of control. any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.



2.6   transactions between shareholders, acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling
      interests after acquisition of control
      in accordance with ias 27 revised, acquisitions or disposals of non-controlling interests, with no impact on control, are considered as transac-
      tions with the group’s shareholders. under this approach, the difference between the consideration paid to increase the percentage share-
      holding in an already-controlled entity and the supplementary share of equity thus acquired is recorded under consolidated equity. similarly,
      a decrease in the group’s percentage interest in an entity that continues to be controlled is booked in the accounts as a transaction between
      shareholders, with no impact on profit or loss.



2.7   discontinued operations (halted or sold), operations and assets classified as held for sale
      discontinued operations
      whenever discontinued operations (halted or sold) or operations classified as held for sale are:
      ˇˇ a business line or a geographical area of business that is material for the group and that forms part of a single disposal plan; or
      ˇˇ a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale;
      they are shown on a separate line of the consolidated income statement at the balance sheet date.
      assets connected with discontinued operations, if held for sale, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their estimated selling
      price less costs to sell. income statement and cash flow items relating to these discontinued operations are shown on a separate line for all
      the periods presented.

      assets classified as held for sale
      non-current assets of which the sale has been decided during the period are shown on a separate line of the balance sheet whenever the sale
      is expected to be completed within 12 months. such assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their estimated selling
      price less costs to sell.
      contrary to discontinued operations, income statement and cash flow items relating to assets classified as held for sale are not shown on a
      separate line.



3.    measurement rules and methods
3.1   use of estimates
      the preparation of financial statements under ifrss requires estimates to be used and assumptions to be made that affect the amounts shown
      in those financial statements.
      these estimates assume the operation is a going concern and are made on the basis of the information available at the time. estimates may
      be revised if the circumstances on which they were based alter or if new information becomes available. actual results may be different from
      these estimates.

      the consequence of the economic and financial crisis in europe, in particular financial market volatility, access to finance and economic growth,
      makes it difficult to assess the outlook for business in the medium term. the consolidated financial statements for the period have therefore
      been prepared with reference to the immediate environment, in particular as regards the estimates given below.

      vinci 2012 annual report                              consolidated financial statements                                                               205




3.1.1         measurement of construction contract profit or loss using the stage of completion method
              the group uses the stage of completion method to recognise revenue and profit or loss on construction contracts, applying the general
              revenue recognition rules on the basis of the stage of completion.
              the stage of completion and the revenue to recognise are determined on the basis of a large number of estimates based on monitoring of the
              work performed and using the benefit of experience to take account of unforeseen circumstances. in consequence, adjustments may be made
              to initial estimates throughout the contract and may materially affect future results.

3.1.2         values used in impairment tests
              the assumptions and estimates made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
              relate in particular to the assessment of market prospects needed to estimate the cash flows, and the discount rates adopted. any change in
              these assumptions could have a material effect on the recoverable amount. the main assumptions used by the group are described in note e.13
              “impairment tests on goodwill and other non-financial assets”.

3.1.3         measurement of share-based payment expenses under ifrs 2
              the group recognises a share-based payment expense relating to the granting to its employees of share options (offers to subscribe to or
              purchase shares), performance share plans and shares under the group savings plans. this expense is measured on the basis of actuarial
              calculations using estimated behavioural assumptions based on observation of past behaviour.
              the main actuarial assumptions (expected volatility, expected return on the share, etc.) adopted by the group are described for each plan in
              note e.19 “share-based payments”.

3.1.4         measurement of retirement benefit obligations
              the group is involved in defined contribution and defined benefit retirement plans. its obligations in connection with these defined benefit
              plans are measured actuarially based on assumptions such as the discount rate, the return on the investments dedicated to these plans, future
              increases in wages and salaries, employee turnover, mortality rates and the rate of increase of health expenses.
              most of these assumptions are updated annually. details of the assumptions used and how they are determined are given in note e.20.1
              “provisions for retirement benefit obligations”. the group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the
              current conditions. obligations may, however, change if assumptions change.

3.1.5         measurement of provisions
              the factors that materially influence the amount of provisions relate to:
              ˇˇ the estimates made on a statistical basis from expenses incurred in previous years, for after-sales-service provisions;
              ˇˇ the forecasts of expenditures on major maintenance over several years used as a basis for the provisions for obligations to maintain the
              condition of infrastructure under concession. these forecasts are estimated taking account of indexation clauses included in construction
              and civil engineering contracts (mainly the tp01, tp02 and tp09 indices);
              ˇˇ the estimates of forecast profit or loss on construction contracts, which serve as a basis for the determination of losses on completion (see
              note a.3.4. “construction contracts”);
              ˇˇ the discount rates used to determine the present value of these provisions.


3.1.6         measurement of financial instruments at fair value
              fair value is determined on the basis of the following three models or levels:
              ˇˇ level 1 – quoted prices on an active market: whenever quoted prices on an active market are available, these are used in priority to determine
              fair value. marketable securities and some listed bond issues are measured in this way;
              ˇˇ level 2 – internal model using internal measurement techniques with observable factors: these techniques are based on usual mathemati-
              cal computation methods, which incorporate observable market data (forward prices, yield curves, etc.). the calculation of the fair value of
              most derivative financial instruments (swaps, caps, floors, etc.) traded on markets is made on the basis of models commonly used by market
              participants to price such financial instruments.
              every quarter, the internally calculated values of derivative instruments are checked for consistency with the values sent to vinci by the
              counterparties.
              ˇˇ level 3 – internal model using non-observable factors: this model applies in vinci only for holdings of unlisted shares, which, in the absence
              of an active market, are measured at their cost of acquisition plus transaction costs.


3.2           revenue
              consolidated revenue of the contracting business (vinci energies, eurovia and vinci construction) is recognised in accordance with ias 11
              “construction contracts”. it includes the total of the work, goods and services generated by the consolidated subsidiaries pursuing their main
              activity and the revenue for construction work on infrastructure under concession. the method for recognising revenue under construction
              contracts is explained in note a.3.4 “construction contracts” below.
              consolidated revenue of the concessions business is recognised in accordance with ias 18 “revenue” and ias 11. the method for recognising
              revenue in respect of concession contracts is explained in note a.3.5 “concession contracts” below. it comprises:
              ˇˇ tolls for the use of motorway infrastructure operated under concession, revenue booked by car parks and airport service concessions, and
              ancillary income such as fees for the use of commercial installations, rental of telecommunications infrastructure and advertising space; and
              ˇˇ revenue in respect of the construction of new concession infrastructure recognised on a stage of completion basis in accordance with ias 11.
              in the property sector, revenue arising on lots sold is recognised as the property development proceeds (in accordance with ifric 15
              “agreements for the construction of real estate”).

206                                              consolidated financial statements




3.3     revenue from ancillary activities
        revenue from ancillary activities mainly comprises rental income, sales of equipment, materials and merchandise, study work and fees other
        than those generated by concession operators.


3.4     construction contracts
        the group recognises construction contract income and expenses using the stage of completion method defined by ias 11. for the
        vinci construction business line, the stage of completion is usually determined on a physical basis. for the other business lines (eurovia and
        vinci energies), it is determined on the basis of the percentage of total costs incurred to date.
        if the estimate of the final outcome of a contract indicates a loss, a provision is made for the loss on completion regardless of the stage of
        completion, based on the best estimates of income, including, if need be, any rights to additional revenue or claims if these are probable and
        can be reliably estimated. provisions for losses on completion are shown under liabilities.
        part payments received under construction contracts before the corresponding work has been carried out are recognised under liabilities
        under advances and payments on account received.


3.5     concession contracts
        under the terms of ifric 12 “service concession arrangements”, a concession operator has a twofold activity:
        ˇˇ a construction activity in respect of its obligations to design, build and finance a new asset that it makes available to the grantor: revenue
        is recognised on a stage of completion basis in accordance with ias 11;
        ˇˇ an operating and maintenance activity in respect of concession assets: revenue is recognised in accordance with ias 18.


        in return for its activities, the operator receives remuneration from either:
        ˇˇ users: the intangible asset model applies. the operator has a right to receive tolls (or other payments) from users in consideration for the
        financing and construction of the infrastructure. the intangible asset model also applies whenever the concession grantor remunerates the
        concession operator based on the extent of use of the infrastructure by users, but with no guarantees as to the amounts that will be paid to
        the operator (under a simple pass through or shadow toll agreement).
        under this model, the right to receive toll payments (or other remuneration) is recognised in the concession operator’s balance sheet under
        “concession intangible assets”. this right corresponds to the fair value of the asset under concession plus the borrowing costs capitalised
        during the construction phase. it is amortised over the term of the arrangement in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the asset’s
        economic benefits are consumed by the entity, starting from the entry into service of the asset.
        this treatment applies to most of the infrastructure concessions, in particular the motorway networks in france, certain bridges and most of
        the parking facilities managed under concession by vinci park.
        ˇˇ the grantor: the financial asset model applies. the operator has an unconditional contractual right to receive payments from the conces-
        sion grantor, irrespective of the amount of use made of the infrastructure.
        under this model, the operator recognises a financial asset, attracting interest, in its balance sheet, in consideration for the services it provides
        (design, construction etc.). such financial assets are recognised in the balance sheet under “loans and receivables”, in an amount correspond-
        ing to the fair value of the infrastructure on first recognition and subsequently at amortised cost. the receivable is settled by means of the
        grantor’s payments received. the financial income calculated on the basis of the effective interest rate, equivalent to the project’s internal
        rate of return, is recognised under operating income.

        in the case of bifurcated models, the operator is remunerated partly by users and partly by the grantor. the part of the investment that is
        covered by an unconditional right to receive payments from the grantor (in the form of grants or rental) is recognised as a financial receivable
        up to the amount guaranteed. the unguaranteed balance, of which the amount is dependent on the extent of use of the infrastructure, is
        recognised under “concession intangible assets”.


3.6     share-based payments
        the measurement and recognition methods for share subscription and purchase plans, the plans d’epargne groupe (group savings plans) and
        performance share plans, are defined by ifrs 2 “share-based payment”. the granting of share options, performance shares and offers to
        subscribe to group savings plans in france and abroad represent a benefit granted to their beneficiaries and therefore constitute supplementary
        remuneration borne by vinci. because such transactions do not give rise to monetary transactions, the benefits granted in this way are rec-
        ognised as expenses in the period in which the rights are acquired, with a corresponding increase in equity. benefits are measured on the
        basis of the fair value at the grant date of the equity instruments granted.
        benefits granted under share option plans, performance share plans and group savings plans are implemented as decided by vinci’s board
        of directors after approval by the shareholders’ general meeting, and are not, in general, systematically renewed. as their measurement is
        not directly linked to the business lines’ operations, vinci has considered it appropriate not to include the corresponding expense in the
        operating income from ordinary activities, which is an indicator of business lines’ performance, but to report it on a separate line, labelled
        “share-based payment expense (ifrs 2)”, in operating income.

3.6.1   share subscription or purchase option plans
        options to subscribe to or purchase shares have been granted to group employees and senior executives. for some of these plans, definitive
        vesting of share subscription or purchase option plans is conditional on performance conditions (stock market performance or financial criteria)
        being met. the fair value of options is determined, at grant date, using the monte carlo valuation model, taking account of the impact of the
        market performance condition if applicable. the monte carlo model allows a larger number of scenarios to be modelled, by including in
        particular the valuation of assumptions about beneficiaries’ behaviour on the basis of historical observations.

3.6.2   performance share plans
        performance shares subject to vesting conditions have been granted to group employees and senior executives. as these are plans under
        which the final vesting of the shares may be dependent on the realisation of financial criteria, the fair value of the shares has been estimated,
        at grant date, taking account of the likelihood of the financial criteria being met, as recommended by ifrs 2.

      vinci 2012 annual report                              consolidated financial statements                                                                 207




              the number of performance shares measured at fair value in the calculation of the ifrs 2 expense is adjusted at each balance sheet date for
              the impact of the change in the likelihood of the financial criteria being met.

3.6.3         group savings plans
              in france, vinci issues new shares reserved for its employees three times a year with a subscription price that includes a discount against the
              average stock market price of the vinci share during the last 20 business days preceding the authorisation by the board of directors. this
              discount is considered as a benefit granted to the employees; its fair value is determined using the monte carlo valuation model at the date
              on which the subscription price is announced to the employees. as certain restrictions apply to the sale or transfer of shares acquired by
              employees under these plans, the fair value of the benefit to the employee takes account of the fact that the shares acquired cannot be freely
              disposed of for five years other than in certain specific circumstances.
              the group recognises the benefits granted in this way to its employees as an expense over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase
              in consolidated equity.
              outside france, in accordance with authorisations given to the board of directors by the shareholders’ general meeting, vinci has set up
              group savings plans for the employees of certain foreign subsidiaries in 14 countries. these plans have different characteristics from those
              for employees in france, partly to ensure that the plans’ value is consistent across all countries despite varying tax and regulatory arrange-
              ments. details of the plans are set out in the relevant note to the financial statements.


3.7           cost of net financial debt
              the cost of net financial debt includes:
              ˇˇ the cost of gross financial debt, which includes the interest expense calculated at the effective interest rate, and gains and losses on interest
              rate derivatives allocated to gross financial debt whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not; and
              ˇˇ the line item “financial income from cash management investments”, which comprises the return on investments of cash and cash equiva-
              lents. investments of cash and cash equivalents are measured at fair value through profit or loss.


3.8           other financial income and expense
              other financial income and expense comprises mainly foreign exchange gains and losses, the effects of discounting to present value, dividends
              received from unconsolidated entities, capitalised borrowing costs, and changes in the value of derivatives not allocated to managing interest
              rate or exchange rate risk.
              borrowing costs borne during construction relate to concession assets and are mainly included in the cost of those assets. they are determined
              as follows:
              ˇˇ to the extent that funds are borrowed specifically for the purpose of constructing an asset, the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation
              on that asset are the actual borrowing costs incurred during the period less any investment income arising from the temporary investment
              of those borrowings;
              ˇˇ when borrowing is not intended to finance a specific project, the interest eligible for capitalisation on an asset is determined by applying a
              capitalisation rate to the expenditure on that asset. this capitalisation rate is equal to the weighted average of the costs of borrowing funds
              for construction work, other than those specifically intended for the construction of given assets.
              this does not relate to the construction of infrastructure under concession accounted for using the financial asset model (see note a.3.20.2
              “loans and receivables at amortised cost”).


3.9           income tax
              income tax is computed in accordance with the tax legislation in force in the countries where the income is taxable.
              in accordance with ias 12, deferred tax is recognised on the temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets
              and liabilities. it is calculated using the latest tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the accounts closing date, which are applied
              according to the schedule for reversing temporary differences. the effects of a change in the tax rate from one period to another are recognised
              in the income statement in the period in which the change occurs.
              deferred tax relating to items recognised directly under equity, in particular share-based payment expenses (under ifrs 2), is also recognised
              under equity.
              whenever subsidiaries have distributable reserves, a deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of the probable distributions that will be
              made in the foreseeable future. moreover, shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method give rise to recognition of a
              deferred tax liability in respect of all the differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of the shares.
              net deferred tax is determined on the basis of the tax position of each entity or group of entities included in the tax group under consideration
              and is shown under assets or liabilities for its net amount per taxable entity. deferred tax is reviewed at each balance sheet date to take account
              in particular of the impact of changes in tax law and the prospect of recovery. deferred tax assets are only recognised if their recovery is
              probable.
              deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.


3.10          earnings per share
              basic earnings per share is the net income for the period after non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of shares
              outstanding during the period less treasury shares.
              in calculating diluted earnings per share, the average number of shares outstanding is adjusted for the dilutive effect of equity instruments
              issued by the company, in particular share subscription or purchase options and performance shares.


3.11          concession intangible assets
              concession intangible assets correspond to the concession operator’s right to operate the asset under concession in consideration for the
              investment expenditures incurred for the design and construction of the asset. this operator’s right corresponds to the fair value of the con-
              struction of the asset under concession plus the borrowing costs capitalised during the construction phase. it is amortised over the term of
              the contract in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the contract’s economic benefits are consumed by the entity, starting from the

208                                                 consolidated financial statements




       date when the right to operate starts to be used. for concessions that have recently entered into service, the amortisation is calculated using
       the progressive, straight-line or diminishing balance method, on the basis of the forecast traffic levels included in the business plan. in the
       particular case of the motorway operating companies asf, cofiroute and escota, the straight-line method is used.


3.12   goodwill
       goodwill is the excess of the cost of a business combination over the group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets,
       liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date(s) of acquisition, recognised on first consolidation.
       goodwill in fully consolidated subsidiaries is recognised under goodwill in consolidated assets. goodwill relating to companies accounted for
       under the equity method is included in the line item “investments in companies accounted for under the equity method”.
       goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired. whenever
       goodwill is impaired, the difference between its carrying amount and its recoverable amount is charged to operating income in the period
       and is not reversible.
       negative goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss in the year of acquisition.

       following adoption of ifrs 3 revised, an option is available to measure non-controlling interests on the acquisition date either at fair value
       (the full goodwill method) or for the portion of the net assets acquired that they represent (the partial goodwill method). the choice can be
       made for each business combination.


3.13   other intangible assets
       other intangible assets mainly comprise operating rights, brands, quarrying rights of finite duration and computer software. other purchased
       intangible assets are measured at cost less any amortisation or cumulative impairment losses. quarrying rights are amortised as materials
       are extracted (volumes extracted during the period are compared with the estimated total volume to be extracted from the quarry over its
       useful life) in order to reflect the decline in value due to depletion. other intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their
       useful life.


3.14   grants related to assets
       grants related to assets are presented in the balance sheet as a reduction of the amount of the asset for which they were received.


3.15   property, plant and equipment
       items of property, plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition or production cost less cumulative depreciation and any impairment
       losses. they are not revalued. they also include concession operating assets that are not controlled by the grantor but that are necessary for
       operation of the concession such as buildings intended for use in the operation, equipment for toll collection, signage, data transmission and
       videosurveillance, and vehicles and equipment.

       depreciation is generally calculated on a straight-line basis over the period of use of the asset. accelerated depreciation may, however, be
       used when it appears more appropriate to the conditions under which the asset is used. for certain complex assets comprising several com-
       ponents, in particular buildings and constructions, each component of the asset is depreciated over its own period of use. in the particular
       case of quarries, they are depreciated as materials are extracted (volumes extracted during the period are compared with the estimated total
       volume to be extracted from the quarry over its useful life) in order to reflect the consumption of the economic benefits.

       the main periods of use of the various categories of items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

       constructions:
       - structure                                                                                                                   between 20 and 50 years
       - general technical installations                                                                                              between 5 and 20 years
       site equipment and technical installations                                                                                     between 3 and 12 years
       vehicles                                                                                                                        between 3 and 5 years
       fixtures and fittings                                                                                                          between 8 and 10 years
       office furniture and equipment                                                                                                 between 3 and 10 years

       depreciation commences as from the date when the asset is ready to enter into service.


3.16   finance leases
       assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as non-current assets whenever the effect of the lease is to transfer to the group sub-
       stantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of these assets, with recognition of a corresponding financial liability. assets held
       under finance leases are depreciated over their period of use.


3.17   investment property
       investment property is property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation. such property is shown on a separate line in the balance sheet.
       it is recorded at its acquisition cost less cumulative depreciation and any impairment losses, in the same way as items of property, plant and
       equipment.

   vinci 2012 annual report                               consolidated financial statements                                                                 209




3.18       impairment of non-financial non-current assets
           under certain circumstances, impairment tests must be performed on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. for intangible
           assets with an indefinite useful life, goodwill and construction work in progress, a test is performed at least annually and whenever there is
           an indication of a loss of value. for other fixed assets, a test is performed only when there is an indication of a loss of value. in accordance with
           ias 36, the criteria adopted to assess indications that an asset might be impaired are either external (e.g. a material change in market condi-
           tions) or internal (e.g. a material reduction in revenue), without distinction.
           assets to be tested for impairment are grouped within cash-generating units that correspond to homogeneous groups of assets that generate
           identifiable cash inflows from their use. whenever the recoverable value of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, an impair-
           ment loss is recognised in operating income. the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell
           and its value in use. value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit.
           the discount rate is determined for each cash-generating unit taking account of its geographical location and the risk profile of its
           business.


3.19       investments in companies accounted for under the equity method
           equity-accounted investments are initially recognised at cost of acquisition, including any goodwill arising. their carrying amount is then
           increased or decreased to recognise the group’s share of the entity’s profits or losses after the date of acquisition. whenever losses are greater
           than the value of the group’s net investment in the equity-accounted entity, these losses are not recognised unless the group has entered
           into a commitment to recapitalise the entity or provide it with funding. the share of the negative net equity of companies accounted for under
           the equity method arising from decreases in the fair value of financial hedging instruments is presented under provisions for financial risks.
           if there is an indication that an investment may be impaired, its recoverable value is tested as described in note a.3.18 “impairment of non-
           financial non-current assets”. impairment losses shown by these impairment tests are recognised as a deduction from the carrying amount
           of the corresponding investments.
           in order to present business lines’ operational performance in the best way possible, the income or loss of companies accounted for under
           the equity method is reported on a specific line, between the “operating income from ordinary activities” and “operating income” lines.
           these shareholdings are in companies in which the group has significant influence and in jointly controlled entities.


3.20       other non-current financial assets
           other non-current financial assets comprise available-for-sale securities, the part at more than one year of loans and receivables measured
           at amortised cost, the part at more than one year of financial receivables under public-private partnership contracts (ppps) and the fair value
           of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges maturing after one year (see note a.3.29.2 “fair value of derivative instruments (assets
           and liabilities)”).

3.20.1     available-for-sale securities
           “available-for-sale securities” comprises the group’s shareholdings in unconsolidated companies.
           at the balance sheet date, available-for-sale securities are measured at their fair value. the fair value of shares in listed companies is determined
           on the basis of the stock market price at the relevant balance sheet date. for unlisted securities, if their fair value cannot be determined reli-
           ably, the securities continue to be measured at their original cost, i.e. their cost of acquisition plus transaction costs.
           changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
           whenever there is an objective indication that such an asset is impaired, the corresponding loss is recognised in profit or loss and may not be
           reversed.
           ˇˇ for securities quoted on an active market, a long-lasting or material decline in fair value below their cost is an objective indication of their
           impairment. the factors considered by the group in assessing the long-lasting or material nature of a decline in fair value are generally the
           following:
           – the impairment is long-lasting whenever the closing stock market price has been lower than the cost of the security for more than 18 months;
           – the impairment is material whenever, at the balance sheet date, there has been a 30% fall in the current market price compared with the
           cost of the financial asset.
           ˇˇ for unlisted securities, the factors considered are the decrease in value of the share of equity held and the absence of prospects for gen-
           erating profits.

3.20.2     loans and receivables at amortised cost
           “loans and receivables at amortised cost” mainly comprises receivables connected with shareholdings, current account advances to companies
           accounted for under the equity method or unconsolidated entities, guarantee deposits, collateralised loans and receivables and other loans
           and financial receivables. it also includes the financial receivables relating to concession contracts and public-private partnerships whenever
           the concession operator has an unconditional right to receive remuneration (generally in the form of “scheduled payments”) from the
           grantor.
           when first recognised, these loans and receivables are recognised at their fair value less the directly attributable transaction costs. at each
           balance sheet date, these assets are measured at their amortised cost using the effective interest method. in the particular case of receivables
           coming under the scope of ifric 12, the effective interest rate used corresponds to the project’s internal rate of return.
           if there is an objective indication of impairment of these loans and receivables, an impairment loss is recognised at the balance sheet date.
           the impairment loss, which corresponds to the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount (i.e. the present value
           of the expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate), is recognised in profit or loss. this loss may be reversed if the
           recoverable value increases subsequently and if this favourable change can objectively be linked to an event arising after recognition of the
           impairment loss.

210                                              consolidated financial statements




3.21     inventories and work in progress
         inventories and work in progress are recognised at their cost of acquisition or of production by the entity. at each balance sheet date, they are
         measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.


3.22     trade receivables and other current operating assets
         “trade receivables” and “other current operating assets” are current financial assets and are initially measured at their fair value, which is
         generally their nominal value, unless the effect of discounting is material. at each balance sheet date, trade receivables and other current
         operating assets are measured at their amortised cost less any impairment losses taking account of any likelihood of non-recovery.
         an estimate of the likelihood of non-recovery is made at each balance sheet date in the light of payment delays and guarantees obtained and
         an impairment loss is recognised if necessary.


3.23     other current financial assets
         “other current financial assets” comprises the fair value of derivative financial instruments (assets) not designated as hedges for accounting
         purposes, the part at less than one year of the fair value of derivative financial instruments (assets) designated as hedges for accounting
         purposes and the part at less than one year of loans and receivables reported under other non-current financial assets (see note a.3.29.2 “fair
         value of derivative financial instruments (assets and liabilities)”).


3.24     cash management financial assets
         “cash management financial assets” comprises investments in money market securities and bonds, and units in ucits, made with a short-
         term management objective, that do not satisfy the ias 7 criteria for recognition as cash (see note a.3.25 “cash and cash equivalents”). as
         the group adopts fair value as being the best reflection of the performance of these assets, they are measured and recognised at their fair
         value, and changes in fair value are recognised through profit or loss.
         purchases and sales of cash management financial assets are recognised at their transaction date.
         their fair value is determined using commonly used valuation models or, for non-listed cash management assets, at the present value of future
         cash flows. in assessing the fair value of listed instruments, the group uses the market price at the balance sheet date or the net asset value
         of ucits.


3.25     cash and cash equivalents
         this item comprises current accounts at banks and cash equivalents corresponding to short-term, liquid investments subject to negligible
         risks of fluctuations of value. cash equivalents comprise in particular monetary ucits and certificates of deposit with maturities not exceeding
         three months at the origin. bank overdrafts are not included in cash and are reported under current financial liabilities.
         the group has adopted the fair value method to assess the return on its financial instruments. changes in fair value are recognised directly
         in profit or loss.
         their fair value is determined using commonly used valuation models or, for non-listed cash management assets, at the present value of future
         cash flows. in assessing the fair value of listed instruments, the group uses the market price at the balance sheet date or the net asset value
         of ucits.


3.26     treasury shares and other equity instruments
         treasury shares held by the group are booked as a deduction from equity at their cost of acquisition. any gains or losses connected with the
         purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of treasury shares are recognised directly in equity without affecting the income statement.
         in accordance with ias 32, equity includes perpetual subordinated bonds that meet the definition of equity instruments.


3.27     non-current provisions
         non-current provisions comprise provisions for retirement benefit obligations and other non-current provisions.

3.27.1   provisions for retirement benefit obligations
         provisions are taken in the balance sheet for obligations connected with defined benefit retirement plans, for both current and former employees
         (people with deferred rights or who have retired). these provisions are determined using the projected unit credit method on the basis of
         actuarial assessments made at each annual balance sheet date. the actuarial assumptions used to determine the obligations vary depending
         on the economic conditions of the country where the plan is operated. each plan’s obligations are recognised separately.
         for defined benefit plans financed under external management arrangements (i.e. pension funds or insurance policies), the surplus or shortfall
         of the fair value of the assets compared with the present value of the obligations is recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet,
         after deduction of cumulative actuarial gains and losses and any past service cost not yet recognised in profit or loss.
         past service cost corresponds to the benefits granted either when a company adopts a new defined benefit plan or when it changes the level
         of benefit of an existing plan. whenever new rights to benefit are acquired as from the adoption of the new plan or the change of an existing
         plan, the past service cost is recognised immediately in profit or loss. conversely, whenever adoption of a new plan or a change in a plan gives
         rise to the acquisition of rights after its implementation date, past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the
         average period remaining until the corresponding rights are fully vested.

   vinci 2012 annual report                               consolidated financial statements                                                                  211




           actuarial gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and from experience adjustments (the effects of differences between
           the actuarial assumptions adopted and that which has actually occurred).
           cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains and losses that exceed 10% of the higher of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and
           the fair value of the plan assets are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the average expected remaining working lives of
           the employees in that plan.
           for defined benefit plans, the expense recognised under operating income or loss comprises the current service cost, the amortisation of
           past service cost, the amortisation of any actuarial gains and losses and the effects of any reduction or winding up of the plan. the interest
           cost (cost of discounting) and the expected yield on plan assets are recognised under other financial income and expenses.
           commitments relating to lump-sum payments on retirement for manual construction workers, which are met by contributions to an outside
           multi-employer insurance fund (cnpo), are considered as being under defined contribution plans and are recognised as an expense as and
           when contributions are payable.

           the part of provisions for retirement benefit obligations that matures within less than one year is shown under current liabilities.

3.27.2     other non-current provisions
           these comprise provisions for other employee benefits, measured in accordance with ias 19, and those provisions that are not directly linked
           to the operating cycle, measured in accordance with ias 37. these are recognised whenever, at the balance sheet date, the group has a legal
           or constructive present obligation towards non-group companies arising from a past event, whenever it is probable that an outflow of resources
           embodying economic benefits will be required to settle this obligation and whenever a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
           obligation. these provisions are measured at their present value, corresponding to the best estimate of the outflow of resources required to
           settle the obligation.
           the part at less than one year of other employee benefits is reported under “other current liabilities”. the part at less than one year of provi-
           sions not directly linked to the operating cycle is reported under “current provisions”.


3.28       current provisions
           current provisions are provisions directly linked to each business line’s own operating cycle, whatever the expected time of settlement of the
           obligation. they are recognised in accordance with ias 37 (see above). they also include the part at less than one year of provisions not directly
           linked to the operating cycle.
           provisions are taken for contractual obligations to maintain the condition of infrastructure under concession, principally by the motorway
           concession operating companies to cover the expense of major road repairs (surface courses, restructuring of slow lanes, etc.), bridges, tunnels
           and hydraulic infrastructure. provisions are calculated on the basis of maintenance expense plans spanning several years, which are updated
           annually. these expenses are reassessed on the basis of appropriate indices (mainly the tp01, tp02 and tp09 indices). provisions are also
           taken whenever recognised signs of defects are encountered on identified infrastructure. these provisions are recognised at their present
           value. the effect of discounting provisions is recognised under “other financial expense”.
           provisions for after-sales service cover group entities’ commitments under statutory warranties relating to completed projects, in particular
           10-year warranties on building projects in france. they are estimated statistically on the basis of expenses incurred in previous years or
           individually on the basis of specifically identified events.
           provisions for losses on completion of contracts and construction project liabilities are set aside mainly when end-of-contract projections,
           based on the most likely estimated outcome, indicate a loss, and when work needs to be carried out in respect of completed projects under
           completion warranties.
           provisions for disputes connected with operations mainly relate to disputes with customers, subcontractors, joint contractors or suppliers.
           restructuring provisions include the cost of plans and measures for which there is a commitment whenever these have been announced
           before the period end.
           provisions for other current liabilities mainly comprise provisions for late delivery penalties, for individual dismissals and for other risks related
           to operations.


3.29       bonds and other financial debt (current and non-current)
3.29.1     bond loans, other loans and borrowings
           these are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. the effective interest rate is determined after taking account of
           redemption premiums and issuance expenses. under this method, the interest expense is measured actuarially and reported under the cost
           of gross financial debt.
           the economic benefit of a loan at a significantly below-market rate of interest, which is the case in particular for project finance granted by
           public-sector organisations, is treated as a government grant and recognised as a reduction of the debt and the related investments, in accord-
           ance with ias 20.
           financial instruments that comprise both a liability component and an equity component, such as bonds convertible into shares, are recognised
           in accordance with ias 32. the carrying amount of the compound instrument is apportioned between its liability component and its equity
           component, the equity component being defined as the difference between the fair value of the compound instrument and the fair value of
           the liability component. the liability component corresponds to the fair value of a liability with similar characteristics but without an equity
           component. the value attributed to the separately recognised equity component is not altered during the term of the instrument. the liability
           component is measured using the amortised cost method over its estimated term. issuance costs are allocated proportionately between the
           liability and equity components.
           the part at less than one year of borrowings is included in “current borrowings”.

3.29.2   fair value of derivative financial instruments (assets and liabilities)
         the group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to market risks (mainly interest rates and foreign currency exchange
         rates). most interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate derivatives used by vinci are designated as hedging instruments. hedge account-
         ing is applicable in particular if the conditions provided for in ias 39 are satisfied:
         ˇˇ at the time of setting up the hedge, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship;
         ˇˇ the effectiveness of the hedging relationship must be demonstrated from the outset and at each balance sheet date, prospectively and
         retrospectively.
         the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of which the maturity is greater than one year is reported in the balance
         sheet under “other non-current financial assets“ or “other loans and borrowings (non-current)”. the fair value of other derivative instruments
         not designated as hedges and the part at less than one year of instruments designated as non-current hedges are reported under “other
         current financial assets“ or “current financial liabilities”.

         financial instruments designated as hedging instruments
         derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are systematically recognised in the balance sheet at fair value (see
         note a.3.1.6 “measurement of financial instruments at fair value”). nevertheless, their recognition varies depending on whether they are
         designated as:
         ˇˇ a fair value hedge of an asset or a liability or of an unrecognised firm commitment;
         ˇˇ a cash flow hedge; or
         ˇˇ a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity.


         fair value hedge
         a fair value hedge enables the exposure to the risk of a change in the fair value of a financial asset, a financial liability or unrecognised firm
         commitment to be hedged.
         changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in profit or loss for the period. the change in value of the hedged item
         attributable to the hedged risk is recognised symmetrically in profit or loss for the period (and adjusted to the carrying amount of the hedged
         item). except for the ineffective portion of the hedge, these two revaluations offset each other within the same line items in the income
         statement.

         cash flow hedge
         a cash flow hedge allows exposure to variability in future cash flows associated with an existing asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast
         transaction, to be hedged.
         changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument are recognised in equity for the effective portion and in profit or loss for the
         period for the ineffective portion. cumulative gains or losses in equity are taken to profit or loss under the same line item as the hedged item
         – i.e. under operating income and expenses for cash flows from operations and under financial income and expense otherwise – when the
         hedged cash flow affects profit or loss.
         if the hedging relationship is interrupted because it is no longer considered effective, the cumulative gains or losses in respect of the derivative
         instrument are retained in equity and recognised symmetrically with the cash flow hedged. if the future cash flow is no longer expected, the
         gains and losses previously recognised in equity are taken to profit or loss.

         hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity
         a hedge of a net investment denominated in a foreign currency hedges the exchange rate risk relating to the net investment in a consolidated
         foreign subsidiary. in a similar way as for cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the value of the derivative instrument is
         recorded in equity under currency translation reserves and the portion considered as ineffective is recognised in profit or loss. the change in
         the value of the hedging instrument recognised in “translation differences” is reversed through profit or loss when the foreign entity in which
         the initial investment was made is disposed of.

         derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments
         derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are reported in the balance sheet at fair value and changes
         in their fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

3.29.3   put options granted to minority shareholders
         put options (options to sell) granted to the minority shareholders of certain group subsidiaries are recognised under other non-current liabilities
         for the present value of the exercise price of the option and as a corresponding reduction of consolidated equity (non-controlling interest and
         equity attributable to equity holders of the parent for the surplus, if any).



3.30     off-balance sheet commitments
         the group’s off-balance sheet commitments are monitored through specific annual and half-year reports.
         off-balance sheet commitments are reported in the appropriate notes, as dictated by the activity to which they relate.

b.           business combinations
1.           acquisition of ga gruppe
             on 7 september 2012, after the european authorities gave antitrust approval, vinci energies completed its acquisition of the
             energieversorgungstechnik (evt) division of swiss group alpiq. vinci energies purchased 100% of the shares in the evt division’s parent
             company.

             evt, now known as ga gruppe, is a group of business units offering a comprehensive range of services including engineering, planning,
             construction and maintenance for power transmission and distribution operators, telecommunications infrastructure operators and industrial
             companies. ga gruppe is based mainly in germany and operates through local subsidiaries in central europe.

             the purchase price of €211 million was paid in cash.

             in accordance with ifrs 3 revised, vinci is currently assessing the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, and
             determining the related deferred tax effects. values were provisionally allocated to identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at
             7 september 2012 based on information available. they may be adjusted during the 12 months following the acquisition on the basis of new
             information regarding the facts and circumstances prevailing at the time of the acquisition.

      the same assumptions as those retained at the acquisition date, would have been €519 million, €9.1 million and €6.6 million respectively.



2.    other acquisitions
      in january 2012, eurovia acquired 100% of napc, a road construction, earthworks and civil engineering company in chennai, india, for €76 mil-
      lion. the provisional allocation of the purchase price, based on the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities
      assumed, resulted in €52.9 million of goodwill being recognised.

      in march 2012, eurovia acquired 100% of carmacks for €145 million. this company, based in alberta, canada, builds and maintains road
      infrastructure under long-term contracts. the provisional allocation of the carmacks purchase price led to €21.0 million of goodwill being
      recognised.

      during 2012, entrepose contracting took control of geostock, a company specialising in underground storage. control was acquired in stages.
      entrepose contracting already had significant influence over geostock through a 25% equity stake, and acquired an additional 25% stake in
      june 2012, giving it joint control. in november 2012, entrepose contracting acquired another 40% of the capital, taking its stake to 90% and
      giving it sole control of geostock. the provisional allocation of the total €57.7 million purchase price, paid in cash, led to €23.1 million of goodwill
      being recognised.

      the group bought out non-controlling interests in the entrepose contracting group through a simplified public tender offer that was completed
      on 30 june 2012. as a result, the group now owns 100% of entrepose contracting. this transaction, which involved a cash payment of €102 mil-
      lion, was recognised as a transaction between shareholders in the group’s consolidated financial statements.

             (*) details of results of hedging derivatives are shown in the table below.


             the cost of net financial debt amounted to €637.7 million in 2012 compared with €646.6 million in 2011, a decrease of €8.9 million, due mainly
             to a €13.0 million reduction in the cost of long-term financial debt arising from:
             ˇˇ a fall of around €174 million in average debt outstanding, due to differences between the amounts of debt repayment and refinancing
             transactions (see note e.22.1 “detail of long-term financial debt”);
             ˇˇ an improvement in the average interest rate due to the impact of lower short-term rates on the cost of debt at floating and capped floating
             rates;
             ˇˇ the rates applied to new bond issues in 2011 and 2012, which were lower overall than the average rate of debts redeemed during the period.
             interest received on net cash decreased as the increase of around €100 million in the average amount of net cash did not offset the impact
             of lower interest rates in 2012.

             other financial income includes borrowing costs included in the cost of non-current assets under construction in an amount of €71.3 million
             in 2012 (including €70.1 million for the asf group), compared with €60.9 million in 2011 (including €59.4 million for the asf group).

             other financial expense includes the effects of discounting assets and liabilities at more than one year to present value for €91.3 million in
             2012, compared with €47.3 million in 2011.
             the effect of discounting to present value relates mainly to provisions for retirement benefit obligations for €42.7 million in 2012 (€41.4 million
             in 2011) and to provisions for the obligation to maintain the condition of concession assets for €33.7 million in 2011 (€6.6 million in 2011).

      the net tax expense for the period comprises:
      ˇˇ a tax expense recognised by the french subsidiaries for €874.3 million (€873.2 million in 2011), including €170.1 million at cofiroute
      (€173.9 million in 2011) and €675.5 million at vinci sa, the lead company in the tax consolidation group that comprises 1,168 french sub-
      sidiaries (€660.7 million in 2011);
      ˇˇ a tax expense of €94.9 million for foreign subsidiaries (€110.4 million in 2011).




7.2   effective tax rate
      the effective tax rate was 33.3% in 2012 compared with 33.6% in 2011.

      the effective tax rate for 2012 is lower than the theoretical tax rate in force in france (36.1% taking account of the 5% exceptional surcharge),
      mainly because of taxation at lower rates of some foreign subsidiaries. the difference between the tax calculated using the standard tax rate
      in force in france and the amount of tax effectively recognised in the period can be analysed as follows:

8.            earnings per share
              basic earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, less the weighted
              average number of treasury shares.

              diluted earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of shares that would have been outstanding had all
              potentially dilutive instruments (in particular share subscription or purchase options and performance shares) been converted into shares.
              earnings are also adjusted as necessary for changes in income and expenses resulting from the conversion into shares of all potentially dilutive
              instruments.

              the dilution resulting from the exercise of share subscription and purchase options and from performance shares is determined using the
              method defined in ias 33. in accordance with this standard, plans of which the stock market price is greater than the average price during the
              period are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.

              the tables below show the reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share:

13.       impairment tests on goodwill and other non-financial assets
          in accordance with ias 36 “impairment of assets”, goodwill and other non-financial assets were tested for impairment at 31 december 2012.

          cash-generating units (cgus) are identified in line with operational reporting and their recoverable amounts are based on a value in use
          calculation. the value in use of each cgu is determined by discounting the forecasted operating cash flows before tax (operating income plus
          depreciation and amortisation plus non-current provisions less operating investments less change in operating wcr), at the rates below.

          in the case of concessions, forecast cash flows are determined across the length of contracts by applying a variable discount rate, determined
          for each period depending on the debt to equity ratio of the entity in question.

          for the other cgus, forecast cash flows are generally determined on the basis of the latest three-year forecasts available. for periods beyond
          the three-year period, cash flows are extrapolated until the fifth year, generally using a growth rate based on management’s assessment of
          the outlook for the entity under consideration.
          beyond the fifth year, the terminal value is determined by capitalising cash flows to infinity.

          of €2,879.9 million.



          non-current assets include in particular concession fixed assets for concession operating companies, and financial receivables for public-

        (group share)


       the decrease in investment commitments made by companies accounted for under the equity method (on the basis of the group’s share)
       relates mainly to lisea (high-speed rail line between tours and bordeaux) for €294.2 million.

       commitments made by the group to provide funding

        (in € millions)                                                                                                    31/12/2012        31/12/2011
        commitments made by the group to provide funding (capital and/or subordinated debt)                                     389.3                527.8


       these commitments relate mainly to project companies in the concessions business, including lisea for €112.8 million.
       the change in 2012 was due to lisea providing €135.3 million of collateral security in place of the initial commitment to provide funding.


       collateral security
       collateral security has been given by vinci or vinci concessions with regard to project companies in the concessions business in the form
       of pledges of shares. the consolidated carrying amount of the shares pledged was €47.7 million at 31 december 2012 and related mainly to
       the smtpc and olympia odos project companies, for €28.9 million and €9.0 million respectively.

        changes in the period in available-for-sale assets arise mainly from the €17.6 million increase in the value of adp shares.

        the €47 million increase in ppp financial receivables in 2012 relates mainly to the edouard herriot swimming pool in bordeaux for vinci
        construction france (€16.2 million) and vinci plc projects in the united kingdom (€9.2 million).
        the increase in other loans and receivables includes a €42.0 million increase relating to the funding of various concession or ppp project
        companies.

        the main concession contracts reported using the financial asset model and the related commitments are described in note f.26 “controlled
        subsidiaries’ concession and ppp contracts – financial asset model or bifurcated model”.

        loans and receivables measured at amortised cost break down by maturity date as follows:

17.2   commitments made and received in connection with construction contracts
       the group manages an order book. in accepting orders, it makes commitments to carry out work or render services. in connection with these
       contracts, the group makes and receives guarantees (personal sureties).
       the amount of the guarantees given below consists mainly of guarantees on contracts for work being performed, issued by financial institu-
       tions or insurers. moreover, group companies benefit from guarantees issued by financial institutions at the request of the joint contractor
       or subcontractor (guarantees received).

                                                                                               31/12/2012                                31/12/2011

       whenever events such as late completion or disputes about the execution of a contract make it likely that a liability covered by a guarantee
       will materialise, a provision is taken in respect of that liability.

       in general, under the rules in force, any risk of loss in connection with performance of a commitment given by vinci or its subsidiaries would
       result in a provision being recognised in the group’s financial statements. vinci therefore considers that the off-balance sheet commitments
       above are unlikely to have a material impact on group assets.

       vinci also grants after-sales service warranties covering several years in its normal course of business. these warranties, when set up, lead
       to provisions estimated on a statistical basis having regard to past experience or on an individual basis in the case of any major problems
       identified. these commitments are therefore not included in the above table.

       moreover, in connection with the construction of the future south europe atlantic high-speed rail line between tours and bordeaux, the group
       has in particular provided a joint and several guarantee and an independent first demand guarantee in favour of lisea under which the group
       guarantees contract performance by the design and construction joint venture (gie cosea).



18.    equity
       capital management policy
       in 2012, vinci continued its purchases of own shares under the programme approved by the shareholders’ general meeting held on 2 may
       2011 and the new programme approved by the shareholders’ general meeting held on 12 april 2012, for a period of 18 months and relating
       to a maximum amount of purchases of €2 billion at a maximum share price of €60. 17,705,000 shares were bought during the period at an
       average price of €36.53, for a total of €646.7 million (excluding related purchase costs of €0.2 million).

       treasury shares (see note e.18.2 “treasury shares”) are allocated to financing external growth transactions, covering performance share plans
       and for employer contributions to international employee share ownership plans.

       vinci’s employee savings policy aims to make it easier for group employees to become shareholders. at 31 december 2012, more than 58%
       of the group’s employees were vinci shareholders through unit funds invested in vinci shares. employees form the largest group of share-
       holders in the company, together holding 9.94% of its shares.

       neither the group’s consolidated equity nor the parent company’s equity is subject to any external constraints in the form of financial covenants.

          in february 2006, vinci issued perpetual subordinated bonds for €500 million.
          issued at a price of 98.831%, this loan pays a fixed coupon of 6.25%, payable annually until november 2015. this is only due if vinci pays a
          dividend to its shareholders or if the company buys back its own shares. after that date, the interest rate becomes floating and payable quar-
          terly at the euribor three-month rate plus 3.75%. vinci may redeem the bonds at par in november 2015 and subsequently at each interest
          payment date.

          finally granted will be reduced in proportion and no options will be granted if the index is equal to or less than 6%.

          options only vest definitively after a period of three years has elapsed and are conditional on beneficiaries being employed by the group until

       on 12 april 2012, vinci’s board of directors granted 2,202,580 performance shares to 1,881 employees with effect from 12 april 2012. final
       vesting of the shares is conditional on a performance index. this index has to show an annual average roce for 2012 and 2013 of 7% or more
       for all the performance shares granted to vest definitively (increased to 9% for members of the executive committee on 12 april 2012). if the
       index is between 6% and 7% (8% and 9% for executive committee members), the number of performance shares finally granted will be reduced
       in proportion and no shares will be granted if the index is equal to or less than 6% (8% for executive committee members).

       performance shares only vest definitively after a period of two years has elapsed and are conditional on beneficiaries being employed by the
       group until the end of the vesting period.

19.3      group savings plans
          vinci’s board of directors defines the conditions for subscribing to the group savings plans in accordance with the authorisations granted to
          it by the shareholders’ general meeting.

          in france, vinci issues new shares reserved for employees three times a year at a subscription price that includes a discount against the average
          stock market price over 20 trading days. this discount was 10% up to the plan for the third four-month period of 2012, and was reduced to 5%
          in the plan for the first four-month period of 2013. subscribers benefit from an employer contribution with an annual maximum of €3,500 per
          person. this maximum figure has been reduced to €2,500 from the plan for the first four-month period of 2013. the benefits granted in this
          way to group employees are recognised in profit or loss and are valued in accordance with ifrs 2 on the basis of the following assumptions:
          ˇˇ length of subscription period: four months;
          ˇˇ length of period during which funds are frozen: five years.


          the estimated number of shares subscribed to at the end of the subscription period is calculated based on a linear regression method applied
          to historical observations of the plans between 2002 and 2012, taking account of the cost of restrictions on the availability of units in the
          savings fund.

          the opportunity cost of the frozen shares subscribed to is estimated from the point of view of a third party holding a diversified portfolio and
          prepared to acquire the frozen shares in return for a discount, which should correspond to the return demanded by a purchaser on own funds
          allocated to hedge against market risk over the period in which the shares are frozen (five years). the market risk is assessed on an annual
          basis applying a value-at-risk approach.

          in 2012, in accordance with authorisations given to the board of directors by the shareholders’ general meeting and pursuant to a decision
          taken by the chairman and chief executive officer on 5 march 2012, vinci initiated savings plans for the employees of certain foreign sub-
          sidiaries. known as castor international, the plans cover 14 countries: belgium, canada, the czech republic, germany, morocco, netherlands,
          poland, portugal, romania, slovakia, spain, switzerland, the uk and the usa.
          these plans aim to reconcile variations in tax regimes and regulations between countries so that their value for employees is consistent. their
          main characteristics are as follows:

20.1   provisions for retirement benefit obligations
       at 31 december 2012, provisions for retirement benefit obligations amounted to €877.7 million (including €821.7 million at more than one
       year) compared with €805.8 million at 31 december 2011 (including €750.8 million at more than one year). they comprise provisions for lump
       sums on retirement and provisions for obligations for supplementary retirement benefits. the part at less than one year of these provisions
       (€56 million at 31 december 2012 and €55 million at 31 december 2011) is reported under other current payables.

       vinci’s retirement benefit obligations under defined benefit plans fall into two categories:
       ˇˇ the obligations borne by vinci or its subsidiaries, covered by provisions recognised in the consolidated balance sheet:
       – for french subsidiaries, these are lump sums paid on retirement, supplementary defined benefit retirement plans of which some of the
       group’s employees and officers are members or other closed defined benefit retirement plans, the beneficiaries of which have retired, and
       an obligation in respect of vinci’s vice-chairman and senior director.
       some plans are pre-financed through contracts with insurance companies. this relates mainly to obligations covered by two contracts with
       cardif/bnp paribas of which certain group executives are beneficiaries.
       – for german subsidiaries, there are several internal plans within the group, including a so-called “direct promises” plan. other defined benefit
       plans, the fürsorge plan for former employees of g+h montage and the eurovia gmbh subsidiaries’ plan, were closed in 2001 and 1999
       respectively. in addition, there are commitments to jubilee bonuses and “atz” early retirement plans.
       – for austrian and dutch subsidiaries, commitments relate mainly to lump sums paid on retirement and/or jubilee bonuses.
       ˇˇ obligations borne through external pension funds. for the most part, these relate to vinci’s uk subsidiaries (vinci plc, nuvia uk, freyssinet
       uk, ringway, vinci energies uk, vinci park uk, faceo uk), the cfe group in belgium and etavis in switzerland.

       the retirement benefit obligations covered by provisions recognised in the balance sheet relate mainly to subsidiaries located in the eurozone
       (france, germany and belgium), the uk and switzerland. they are calculated on the basis of the following assumptions:

       discount rates have been determined on the basis of the yield on private-sector bonds with a rating of aa or above and whose maturities
       correspond to the plans’ expected cash flows. the discount rate finally adopted is the rate equivalent to the application of the various rates
       depending on maturities.

       the other local actuarial assumptions (economic and demographic assumptions) are set on the basis of the conditions in each of the countries
       in question.

       the preferred method used to determine the expected return on plan assets is the building block method, which breaks the expected return
       down into the main asset classes: money market investments, investments in bonds and investments in equities. the target allocation of funds
       is then applied to calculate a weighted average return on assets. in the specific case of funds invested in an insurance company’s “general
       account” funds, the expected yield has been determined by also taking account of the specific features of each contract, in particular regarding
       past and forecast net yields.

       plan assets are valued at their fair value at 31 december 2012. the book value at 31 december 2012 is used for assets invested with insurance
       companies.

      the increase in actuarial gains and losses in 2012 arises mainly from the decline in discount rates in the eurozone, switzerland and the united
      kingdom, partially offset by the good performance of hedging assets.
      changes in the period under “business combinations” relate mainly to the obligations of german group ga gruppe, acquired by vinci energies
      in the second half of 2012.

          expenses recognised in respect of defined contribution plans
          in some countries, and more especially in france and spain, the group contributes to basic state pension plans, for which the expense rec-
          ognised is the amount of the contributions called by the state bodies. basic state pension plans are considered as being defined contribution
          plans. depending on the country, the proportion of these contributions paid that relates to pensions may not be clearly identifiable.

          the amounts taken as an expense in the period in respect of defined contribution plans (excluding basic state plans) totalled €466.4 million
          at 31 december 2012 (€440.1 million at 31 december 2011). these amounts include the contributions paid to the external multi-employer
          fund (cnpo) in respect of obligations in regard to lump sums paid on retirement to building workers in france.

       other employee benefits
       provisions for other employee benefits include long-service bonuses, jubilee bonuses and medical expense cover.
       at 31 december 2012, these provisions amounted to €136.9 million, including €41.2 million relating to medical expense cover.
       provisions for medical expense cover were calculated on the basis of a rate of growth in medical expenses of between 0% and 6%. a change
       of 1% in this rate would entail a change of €5.9 million in the obligation.

       the provisions have been calculated using the following actuarial assumptions:
                                                                                                                                       31/12/2012            31/12/2011

       provisions for financial risks
       provisions for financial risks comprise in particular the attributable share of the negative net equity of companies accounted for under the
       equity method, arising mainly from falls in the fair value of interest rate hedging instruments (cash flow hedges) in infrastructure project
       companies operated under concessions or public-private partnerships.

       provisions for other liabilities
       provisions for other liabilities, not directly linked with the operating cycle, include mainly the provisions for disputes and arbitration, some of
       which are described in note h “note on litigation”. these amounted to €510.0 million at 31 december 2012 (€544.4 million at 31 december 2011),
       including €303.6 at more than one year (€257.6 million at 31 december 2011).

       employee training rights
       the french act of 4 may 2004 gives employees of french businesses the right to a minimum of 20 hours of training a year, which can be car-
       ried forward and accumulated over a period of six years. expenditure under this individual right to training is considered as an expense for the
       period and does not give rise to the recognition of a provision, except in exceptional cases. the group’s employees had acquired rights to
       8.9 million hours of such training at 31 december 2012.

       current provisions (including the part at less than one year of non-current provisions) are directly connected with the operating cycle and
       comprise principally the provisions relating to construction contracts and provisions for the obligation to maintain the condition of concession
       assets.

       for the most part, such provisions cover the expenses incurred by motorway concession operating companies for road repairs (surface courses,
       restructuring of slow lanes, etc.), bridges, tunnels and hydraulic infrastructure. these provisions comprise mainly €347.8 million for the asf
       group at 31 december 2012 (€333 million at 31 december 2011) and €205.2 million for cofiroute at 31 december 2012 (€193.6 million at
       31 december 2011).

       according to their accounting category, under other non-current financial assets or liabilities for the part at more than one year, and other
       current financial assets or liabilities for the part at less than one year. derivative financial instruments (assets and liabilities) that are not des-
       ignated as hedges for accounting purposes are reported as other current financial assets or liabilities, whatever their maturity dates.

           the investment vehicles used by the group are money market ucits, interest-bearing accounts, term deposits and negotiable debt securities
           (certificates of deposit generally with a maturity of less than three months). they are measured and recognised at their fair value.

           net cash is managed with limited risk to capital, and performance and the associated risks are subject to control.

           at 31 december 2012, net cash at the vinci holding company level amounted to €3.3 billion. this amount arises mainly from the cash surpluses
           transferred upwards from french subsidiaries through a cash pooling system. vinci finance international, a wholly owned subsidiary of vinci
           that centralises the cash surpluses of certain foreign subsidiaries, held cash investments of €0.5 billion at 31 december 2012. this centralisa-
           tion enables the management of financial resources to be optimised and the risks relating to the counterparties and investment vehicles used
           to be better managed.
           other group subsidiaries’ cash investments are managed in a decentralised manner while complying with the guidelines issued by the group
           and the instructions given by vinci, which define in particular the investment vehicles and the counterparties authorised. they amounted to
           €1.9 billion at 31 december 2012, including €0.4 billion for the concessions business and €1.5 billion for the contracting business.

           the performance and the risks associated with these investments of net cash are monitored regularly, through a report detailing the yield of
           the various assets on the basis of their fair value and analysing the associated level of risk.

22.2.3 revolving credit facilities
         vinci sa has a €4 billion confirmed syndicated loan facility maturing in june 2016 with two one-year extension options at the lenders’ discre-
         tion. on 6 july 2012, the initial request to extend the syndicated loan was accepted by most banks in the pool. as a result, the credit facility
         will now mature in june 2017 instead of june 2016, and is for an amount of €3.5 billion.

         since february 2011, cofiroute has had a €500 million confirmed club deal bank facility maturing in february 2016.

         on 20 july 2012, asf refinanced its €2 billion syndicated revolving credit facility due to expire in december 2013 in an amount of €1.8 billion,
         with a five-year maturity. this new facility is subject to the same financial covenants as the previous facility (see note e.22.2.5 “financial
         covenants”).

         at 31 december 2012, none of the above credit facilities was being used.

         the amounts authorised and used, and the maturities of the credit lines of vinci and its subsidiaries are as follows:

                                                                                                                                                                    maturity

23.        financial risk management
           vinci has implemented a system to manage and monitor the financial risks to which it is exposed, principally interest rate risk.

           in accordance with the rules laid down by the group’s finance department, the responsibility for identifying, measuring and hedging financial
           risks lies with the operational entity in question. on the other hand, derivative financial instruments are generally managed by the group
           finance department on behalf of the subsidiaries in question.

           treasury committees, in which the group’s finance department and the concerned companies participate, analyse the main exposures regularly
           and decide on management strategies for the entities that have the most material exposure to financial risks (vinci sa, asf, cofiroute, vinci
           park, vinci finance international).

           in order to manage its exposure to market risks, the group uses derivative financial instruments, which are recognised in the balance sheet
           at their fair value.

           at the balance sheet date, the fair value of derivative financial instruments breaks down as follows:

                                                                                                                                                        31 december 2012       31 december 2011

23.1       interest rate risk
           interest rate risk is managed within the group, making a distinction between the concessions business, the contracting business and holding
           companies, as their respective financial profiles are not the same.

           for concession operating subsidiaries, interest rate risk is managed with two timescales: the long term, aiming to ensure and maintain the
           concession’s economic equilibrium, and the short term, with an objective of optimising the average cost of debt depending on the situation
           in financial markets.
           over the long term, the objective is to change over time the breakdown between fixed and floating rate debt depending on the debt level
           (measured by the ratio of net debt to cash flows from operations before tax and financing costs), with a greater proportion at fixed rate when
           the level of debt is high.
           as regards contracting activities and holding companies, they have a structural net cash surplus because the contracting subsidiaries’ cash
           surpluses, of which the management is mainly centralised under the cash pooling system, are higher than the holding companies’ debt. for
           these activities, the objective is to ensure that the risks connected with financial assets and financial liabilities are well matched.

           to hedge its interest rate risk, the group uses derivative financial instruments in the form of options or swaps of which the start may be
           deferred. these derivatives may be designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, in accordance with the ifrss.

23.1.1   sensitivity to interest rate risk
         vinci is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, given:
         ˇˇ the cash flows connected with net floating rate debt;
         ˇˇ fixed rate financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet at fair value through profit or loss;
         ˇˇ derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedges. these mainly comprise net call option positions of which the maximum
         loss over the life of the transaction is equal to the premium paid.

         on the other hand, fluctuations in the value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity and have no effect
         on profit or loss.

         the analysis below has been prepared assuming that the amount of the financial debt and derivatives at 31 december 2012 remains constant
         over one year. the consequence of a variation in interest rates of 25 basis points at the balance sheet date would be an increase or decrease
         of equity and pre-tax income for the amounts shown below. for the purpose of this analysis, the other variables are assumed to remain
         constant.

                                                                                                                                      31/12/2012

23.1.3     cash flow hedges
           the group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate debt and may set up floating rate lender/fixed rate borrower swaps
           designated as cash flow hedges to hedge this risk.

           hedging of contractual cash flows
           the group has set up interest rate swaps that serve to render interest payments on floating rate debt fixed. contractual cash flows relating
           to swaps are paid symmetrically with the hedged interest payment flows. the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss in the
           period in which the interest payment cash flow affects profit or loss.

           hedging of highly probable cash flows
           the group has set up deferred start swaps at asf with maturities of up to 2016. these serve to fix the interest payments on future issues of
           debt considered as highly probable. at 31 december 2012, the portfolio of these swaps was €779 million.

           generally, the group’s activities in foreign countries are financed by loans in the local currency.
           debts in foreign currency of subsidiaries of which the operating currency is the euro (mainly vinci and asf) have been hedged at their time
           of issue and do not generate any exposure to exchange rate risk.


23.3.3     nature of the group’s risk exposure
           74% of vinci’s business is in the eurozone. the group’s exposure to currency risk is therefore limited. transactions outside the eurozone are
           generally made in the local currency for permanent establishments and, to a great extent, in euros and dollars, in the case of major export
           projects.

           vinci may find itself exposed to currency risk whenever, in isolated cases, the parent company provides finance to certain foreign subsidiaries,
           and on cash flows intended to be paid to the parent company. this exposure is generally covered by cross currency swaps or forward exchange
           transactions.

           vinci’s foreign currency risk management policy consists of hedging the transactional risk connected with subsidiaries’ ordinary
           operations.
           however, vinci does not systematically hedge the currency risk connected with its foreign investments, resulting in translation exposure.

23.3.4     analysis of foreign currency exchange rate risk
           the principal foreign exchange risk exposure was as follows at 31 december 2012:

           there remains a residual exposure on some assets that have not been designated as hedges. a 10% appreciation of foreign currencies against
           the euro would have a pre-tax negative impact on the financial statements of €6.8 million.

23.4   commodity risks
       most of the group’s revenue arises either from contracts that include price revision clauses or under short-term contracts. the risks associ-
       ated with an increase in commodity prices are therefore generally limited.
       for major contracts with no price revision clauses, the commodity risks are analysed on a case-by-case basis and managed in particular by
       negotiating firm price agreements with suppliers and/or through cash-and-carry deals and/or hedging derivatives based on commodity
       indexes.
       for its small contracts in france, of which the average length is less than three months and which do not include price revision clauses, eurovia
       has set up a policy to manage bitumen price risks by putting in place short-maturity hedging derivatives (swaps of less than three months on
       average).
       vinci uses little unprocessed raw material, other than the aggregates produced and used by eurovia. in 2012, approximately 37% of eurovia’s
       aggregates came from group quarries.


23.5   credit and counterparty risk
       vinci is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by its customers and to counterparty risk in respect of its investments of cash (credit
       balances at banks, negotiable debt securities, term deposits, marketable securities, etc.), subscription to derivatives, commitments received
       (sureties and guarantees received), unused authorised credit facilities, and financial receivables.

       the group has set up procedures to manage and limit credit risk and counterparty risk.

       trade receivables
       approximately 35% of consolidated revenue is generated with public sector, or quasi-public sector, customers. moreover, vinci considers that
       the concentration of credit risk connected with trade receivables is limited because of the large number of customers and the fact that they
       are widely scattered across france and other countries. no customer accounts for more than 10% of vinci’s revenue. in foreign countries and
       in developing countries, the risk of non-payment is generally covered by appropriate insurance policies (coface, documentary credit, etc.).
       trade receivables are broken down in note e.21.2 “breakdown of trade receivables”.

       financial instruments (cash investments and derivatives)
       financial instruments (cash investments and derivatives) are set up with financial institutions that meet the group’s credit rating criteria. the
       group has also set up a system of counterparty limits to manage its counterparty risk. maximum risk amounts by counterparty are defined
       taking account of their credit ratings as published by standard & poor’s and moody’s. the limits are regularly monitored and updated on the
       basis of a consolidated quarterly reporting system.
       the group finance department also distributes instructions to the subsidiaries laying down the authorised limits by counterparty, the list of
       authorised ucits (french subsidiaries) and the selection criteria for money market funds (foreign subsidiaries).

       contractual capital investment obligations for asf and escota relate in particular to the relief section on the a9 near montpellier and the green
       motorway package.
       cofiroute’s contractual capital investment obligations comprise the green motorway package and the investments provided for under the
       2011–2014 master plan.

       the above amounts do not include obligations relating to maintenance expenditure on infrastructure under concession.

       the investments by motorway concession companies (asf, escota, cofiroute and arcour) are financed by issuing bonds on the markets, taking
       out new loans from the european investment bank (eib) or drawing on their available credit facilities.

       some concession operating companies have given collateral security to guarantee the financing of their investments in concession infrastruc-

29.    contractual obligations and other off-balance sheet commitments
       contractual obligations and other commitments made and received break down as follows:


29.1   contractual obligations
        (in € millions)                                                                                                                                       31/12/2012     31/12/2011

       (*) excluding capital investment obligations under concession contracts (see note f. “notes on the main features of concession and ppp contracts”).



       operating lease commitments amounted to €1,163 million at 31 december 2012 (€983.5 million at 31 december 2011). of this, €764.3 million
       was for property (€626.1 million at 31 december 2011), €342.7 million for movable items (€300 million at 31 december 2011) and €56 million
       for quarrying rights (€57.4 million at 31 december 2011).

       the purchase and capital expenditure obligations mentioned above relate mainly to vinci immobilier and eurovia.

       commitments in respect of vinci park fixed fees related to rent paid to grantors during the contract period.

        other commitments made (received)                                                                                                                           147.5           335.5
       (*) group’s share of a total commitment of €139.6 million at 31 december 2012 (€123.6 million at 31 december 2011).

       collateral securities (mortgages and collateral for finance)
       in addition to commitments in connection with concession contracts, collateral security may be given. this relates mainly to mortgage guar-
       antees given by eurovia on assets in poland.


       joint and several guarantees covering unconsolidated partnerships (sncs, economic interest groupings, etc.)
       part of vinci’s business in the construction and roads business lines is conducted through unincorporated joint venture partnerships (seps),
       in line with industry practice. in partnerships, partners are legally jointly and severally liable for that entity’s debts to non-group companies,
       without limit. in this context, the group may set up crossed counter guarantees with its partners.

       whenever the group is aware of a particular risk relating to a joint venture partnership’s activity, a provision is taken in the consolidated financial
       statements.

  vinci 2012 annual report                                   consolidated financial statements                                                          265




          the amount shown under off-balance sheet commitments in respect of joint and several guarantees is the group’s share of the liabilities of
          the partnerships in question less equity and financial debt (loans or current account advances) due to partners.

          given in particular the quality of its partners, the group considers that the risk of its guarantee being invoked in respect of these commitments
          is negligible.


          the commitments made and received by the group in connection with concession contracts, construction contracts and items connected
          with unrecognised retirement benefit obligations are shown in the following notes:

h. note on litigation
          the companies comprising the vinci group are sometimes involved in litigation arising from their activities. the related risks are assessed
          by vinci and the subsidiaries involved on the basis of their knowledge of the cases, and provisions are taken in consequence.

          the main disputes in progress at the date of this document were as follows:

          ˇˇ on 12 february 2010, the conseil régional d’ile-de-france – the regional authority for the greater paris area – applied to the paris court of
          first instance (tribunal de grande instance) for a ruling against 15 companies, of which several are members of the vinci group, and 11 natural
          persons, some of whom are or have been vinci group employees, ordering them to pay a sum corresponding to the damage it claims to have
          suffered. the total amount claimed is €232 million plus interest from 7 july 1997. in march 2011, the judge ordered the regional authority
          to make its claim more precise and divide it into sub-dossiers, one for each contract. in an order dated 31 may 2012, the judge decided to
          divide the proceedings in order to deal with the defendant’s strike-out applications first, and with the substantive issues second, ordering
          the parties to attend a case management hearing. this application by the regional authority was further to a judgment by the paris appeal
          court on 27 february 2007 against various natural persons finding them guilty of operating a cartel as well as to the decision on 9 may 2007
          by the conseil de la concurrence(*) (competition authority) and the ruling of the paris court of appeal of 3 july 2008 imposing penalties on the
          enterprises for anti-competitive practices between 1991 and 1996 in connection with the programme to renovate secondary educational
          establishments in the greater paris region. at 31 december 2012, the group continued to treat this risk as a contingent liability that it is not
          in a position to measure.

      ˇˇ king county, the county seat of which is seattle, washington, is in dispute with a consortium in which vinci construction grands projets
      has a 60% share, the purpose of which is to perform a contract for the construction of two underground tunnels known as “brightwater
      central”. because of particularly difficult geotechnical conditions and changes to the initial contract terms, it was not possible to complete
      the work as set out in the contract, and this resulted in delays and cost overruns. as a result, king county decided to complete one of the
      tunnels using another company that had a tunnel boring machine using a technology different from that of the tunnel boring machine that
      the consortium was contractually obliged to use. king county initiated proceedings before the king county superior court in seattle in order
      to obtain compensation for the cost of completing the work, and for damage that it claims to have suffered. the consortium, meanwhile, is
      claiming compensation for the cost overruns arising from the work. a hearing took place before a jury which, on 20 december 2012, decided
      that the consortium should pay $155 million to king county and that king county should pay $26 million to the consortium. the king county
      superior court must now deliver its judgment to formalise the jury’s decision. it will be possible to appeal against this judgment before the
      washington state court of appeals. the group, noting the jury’s findings, considers that in view of the current situation, this dispute is unlikely
      to have a material effect on its financial situation.

      ˇˇ in march 2010, the seine maritime département applied to the rouen administrative court to order eurovia haute-normandie to pay
      €70.7 million, corresponding to the value of tenders awarded in 1988, 1993 and 1998, which the département is asking the court to declare
      null and void on the grounds of anti-competitive practices preceding their award. by an order dated 21 june 2012, the chairman of the conseil
      d’etat’s disputes division referred the matter to the orléans administrative court. this action by seine maritime follows a decision made by
      the rouen court of appeal on 14 december 2009, confirming a judgment of the rouen criminal court dated 11 september 2008, in which
      the companies were ordered to pay €4.9 million to compensate for the material damage suffered by the département. these decisions were
      themselves consecutive to a decision of the conseil de la concurrence (*) of 15 december 2005 imposing sanctions on six companies, includ-
      ing eurovia haute-normandie, for anti-competitive practices committed between 1991 and 1998 with respect to tenders for the supply
      and application of bitumen coatings, which was confirmed on appeal by the paris court of appeal on 30 january 2007. in view of the current
      situation, the group considers that this dispute will not have a material effect on its financial situation.

      ˇˇ sncf initiated proceedings in the paris administrative court on 14 march 2011 against eight construction companies, including several
      group subsidiaries, seeking €59.4 million for damages it claims to have suffered as a result of contracts formed in 1993 relating to the con-
      struction of civil engineering structures at the magenta and saint lazare condorcet railway stations. these proceedings followed a ruling
      made by the conseil de la concurrence (*) on 21 march 2006. in view of the current situation, the group considers that this dispute will not
      have a material effect on its financial situation.

      ˇˇ eurovia cs, a subsidiary of eurovia in the czech republic, together with a number of non-group companies, are the subject of several claims
      made by the czech republic’s road and motorway directorate (rmd). these claims relate to works carried out between 2003 and 2007 in
      the context of construction of the d47 motorway. at the end of 2012, the rmd initiated arbitration and court proceedings challenging (i) the
      inflation coefficients used for the purposes of reviewing the price of the works; and (ii) the payment of various sums in respect of defective
      workmanship which, according to the rmd, affected the roads and engineering structures built. the construction companies formally contest
      the basis for these claims and their amount, which totals 2.9 billion czech koruna (eurovia cs’s share is 2.2 billion czech koruna, or about
      €87 million). the group has decided to treat this risk as a potential liability which it is not in a position to quantify.

      the following litigation ended in 2012:

      ˇˇ vinci’s subsidiary cbc built a hotel in bratislava (slovakia) for intertour, part of whose equity it held. the transaction was financed through
      promissory notes issued by intertour and discounted on a non-recourse basis by cbc with a french bank, which had counter-guarantees
      from foreign financial institutions. after intertour defaulted on its payments, vtb bank france sued cbc claiming damages of €24 million on
      the basis of alleged responsibility in connection with the invalidity of the guarantees issued by the foreign financial institutions in this french
      bank’s favour. this suit was rejected by the paris commercial court in a ruling dated 13 march 2009. the decision was upheld by the paris
      appeal court on 15 march 2012. vtb bank france, which had appealed to the final court of appeal (the cour de cassation) against this deci-
      sion, withdrew its appeal on 16 october 2012. as a result, the group considers that this matter will have no impact on its financial position.

      ˇˇ after the decision by the constitutional court of 11 february 2011 – which declared the act of 11 december 1996 validating the stade de
      france concession as unconstitutional – there is no longer any dispute relating to this decision as regards the stade de france, which is oper-
      ated by consortium stade de france (in which the group owns a 66.6% stake).

      to the company’s knowledge, there are no other disputes or matters submitted to arbitration (including any proceedings known to the company,
      pending or with which it is threatened) that are likely to have, or have had in the last 12 months, a material effect on the business, financial
      performance, net assets or financial situation of the company or group.

32.2         vinci selected to acquire ana, the portuguese airport concession company
             on 27 december 2012, vinci concessions was selected by the portuguese government to acquire ana, the holder of a 50-year concession
             to operate the country’s 10 airports: lisbon, porto, faro and beja on the mainland; ponta delgada, horta, flores and santa maria in the azores;
             and funchal and porto santo in madeira.
             ana constitutes a group of high quality airports that handled 30 million passengers in 2011 and has a large proportion of international busi-
             ness. passenger numbers have increased at an annual average of over 4% over the past 10 years. the lisbon hub handles a quarter of all traffic
             between europe and brazil, while traffic to portuguese-speaking africa (angola and mozambique) is seeing strong growth. in addition to
             managing airport facilities, ana’s operations include retail activities, ground handling services, and safety and security.

             through the acquisition of ana, vinci concessions subsidiary vinci airports will become a significant international player in airport conces-
             sions, with 23 airports managed in portugal, france and cambodia. these airports handle 40 million passengers a year, including a european
             hub in lisbon with over 15 million passengers. vinci airports will have revenue of around €600 million and ebitda of more than
             €270 million.

             the transaction is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2013, and is subject to prior approval by the european competition
             authorities.

report of the statutory auditors
on the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 december 2012
             to the shareholders

             in accordance with our appointment as statutory auditors by your shareholders’ general meeting, we hereby report to you for the year ended
             31 december 2012 on:
             ˇˇ the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of vinci sa;
             ˇˇ the justification of our assessments; and
             ˇˇ the specific verification required by law.
             the consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors. our role is to express an opinion on these financial
             statements, based on our audit.



1.           opinion on the consolidated financial statements
             we conducted our audit in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france. those standards require that we plan and perform
             the audit in such a way as to obtain reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit
             consists of examining, by sampling or other selection methods, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
             statements. an audit also consists of assessing the accounting principles used, significant estimates made and the overall presentation of the
             financial statements. we believe that the information that we have collected provides a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.
             in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the period give a true and fair view of the financial position, the assets and liabilities,
             and the results of the group formed by the persons and entities included in the consolidation, in accordance with the international financial
             reporting standards as endorsed by the european union.



2.           justification of our assessments
             as required by article l.823-9 of the french commercial code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the
             following:
             ˇˇ as stated in note a.3.1, the vinci group uses estimates prepared on the basis of information available at the time of preparing its conso-
             lidated financial statements, in a context of economic and financial crisis in europe, where the medium-term outlook for business is difficult
             to assess due to the impacts on financial market volatility, access to financing and economic growth. these estimates relate in particular to:
             – construction contracts: the vinci group recognises income from its long-term contracts using the percentage of completion method on
             the basis of the best available estimates of the final outcome of contracts, as stated in note a.3.4. we have assessed the assumptions used
             by the company in making these estimates and reviewed the calculations made;
             – impairment tests on non-financial assets: the vinci group performs impairment tests at least annually on goodwill, and also assesses
             whether there is any indication that long-term assets may be impaired, in accordance with the methodology described in notes a.3.18 and
             e.13 to the consolidated financial statements. we have examined how these impairment tests are performed and the cash flow forecasts and
             assumptions used.
             these assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and have therefore contributed
             to the formation of our opinion, given in the first part of this report.



3.           specific verification
             we have also verified in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france and as required by law, the information concerning
             the group presented in the report of the board of directors.
             we have no comments to make as to its fair presentation and its conformity with the consolidated financial statements.


                                                                          paris-la défense and neuilly sur seine, 7 february 2013

notes to the financial statements
a. key events in the period
1.    changes in investments in subsidiaries and affiliates
      in may 2012, vinci sa initiated a simplified public offer for the shares in entrepose contracting that the group did not already own (19.83%
      of its share capital) at a price of €100 per share. after the offer ended, the vinci group owned 97.37% of entrepose contracting’s shares. it
      then squeezed out all remaining shareholders that did not originally tender their shares to the offer. at 30 june 2012, the vinci group’s stake
      in entrepose contracting was 100%, representing an additional investment of €102.4 million.
      at the end of november 2012, vinci sa transferred all its shares in entrepose contracting to vinci construction participation.

      in the second quarter of 2012, vinci sa sold its stake in cegelec to vinci energies for €1,292 million. vinci energies paid for the stake with
      shares issued through a €736 million capital increase, with the remainder paid in cash.

      lastly, vinci sa increased the share capital of its subsidiary vinci finance international by €250 million.



2.    treasury shares

      €36.53 per share.

      the gross carrying amount of treasury shares increased from €1,097.5 million at 31 december 2011 to €1,661.8 million at 31 december 2012.



3.    financing activities
      as part of its emtn programme, vinci sa carried out several bond placements in the first half of 2012 to refinance debt maturing in the fourth
      quarter of 2012 and 2013:

      in parallel, vinci sa made an early repayment of €750 million in january 2012 to cover the remainder of the loan taken out in 2006 to finance
      the acquisition of asf.

      lastly, in august 2012, vinci sa extended a €1 billion credit facility to asf holding.



b.    accounting policies and methods
      the financial statements at 31 december 2011 have been prepared in accordance with the rules applicable in france.

      however, in a departure from the french general accounting plan and in order to improve the clarity of its financial statements, vinci reports
      changes in provisions relating to income and expense items on the same line of the income statement, as determined by their nature, which
      may be operating, financial, exceptional or tax.



1.    intangible assets
      other than in special cases, software, recorded under “concessions, patents and licences”, is amortised over two or three years on a straight-
      line basis.



2.    property, plant and equipment
      property, plant and equipment is recognised at acquisition cost, including acquisition and installation costs.
      depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life:

      constructions                                                                 10 to 40 years
      other property, plant and equipment                                            3 to 10 years

     vinci 2012 annual report                                parent company financial statements                                                                 281




             the company applies cnc opinion 2004-06, issued by the conseil national de la comptabilité, on the definition, recognition and measure-
             ment of assets.



3.           investments in subsidiaries and affiliates
             investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are measured at their cost of acquisition. in accordance with crc regulation 2004-06, issued by the
             comité de la règlementation comptable, on the definition and recognition of assets, vinci includes the associated acquisition expenses in the
             cost of shares. if this cost is greater than the asset’s value in use, an impairment allowance is taken equal to the difference, as an exceptional item.

             value in use is determined on the basis of the portion of the equity represented by the shares. this portion is adjusted if necessary to take
             account of the cash flow prospects for the companies in question.

             capital gains or losses on disposal of shareholdings are recorded under exceptional income and expense.



4.           trade receivables and related accounts
             trade receivables are measured at their nominal value. an impairment allowance is recognised if there is a possibility of non-recovery of these
             receivables.



5.           receivables and payables denominated in foreign currency
             receivables and payables denominated in foreign currency are measured at the closing rate or at their hedged rate. any gains or losses arising
             on this translation are recorded in the balance sheet as translation differences. provisions are taken in respect of any unrealised losses unless
             specific rules are laid down in the accounting regulations.



6.           marketable securities
             marketable securities are recognised at their acquisition cost and an impairment loss is recorded whenever the cost is higher than the latest
             net realisable value at the period end.



7.           financial instruments
             loans (bonds, bank and intra-group borrowing) are recorded under liabilities at their nominal value. the associated issuance costs are recorded
             under deferred expenses, redemption premiums under assets, and issuance premiums under deferred income. these three items are amortised
             over the length of the loan.
             loans and advances are recognised at nominal value. in the event of a risk of non-recovery, an impairment allowance is recognised.

             forward financial instruments and derivative financial instruments are measured at the period end. a provision is recognised in the income
             statement for any unrealised losses only if the instruments are not designated as hedges.



8.           treasury shares
             treasury shares allocated to share purchase option and performance share plans are recognised under marketable securities.
             in accordance with crc regulation 2008-15, issued by the comité de la règlementation comptable, a provision is taken as a financial expense
             during the period in which the beneficiaries’ rights vest, whenever an expense becomes probable.

             treasury shares not allocated to plans are recorded under other non-current financial assets at their acquisition cost.
             an impairment allowance is recognised as a financial expense if the average stock market price of these shares during the last month of the
             period is lower than their unit cost. however, shares intended for cancellation are not written down.

             whenever plans are hedged by call options, the premiums paid are recorded under marketable securities when the options hedge share purchase
             option plans or performance share plans, and under other non-current financial assets when these options hedge share subscription option plans.
             in both cases, a provision is recognised whenever an expense becomes probable.

             income and expense relating to treasury shares (provisions and gains or losses on disposal) are recognised under financial income/(expense).

282                                                 parent company financial statements




9.    retirement benefit obligations
      provisions are recorded in the balance sheet in respect of the company’s obligations to pay supplementary pensions to certain employees or
      company officers, for the part relating to beneficiaries who are retired. an off-balance sheet commitment is recorded for the portion relating
      to beneficiaries who have not yet retired.

      retirement benefit obligations (lump sums paid on retirement and supplementary retirement benefit plans) are measured using the prospec-
      tive actuarial method (the projected unit credit method) on the basis of external assessments made at each period end, for each existing plan.

      actuarial gains and losses that exceed 10% of commitments or of the market value of the corresponding investments are amortised over the
      average residual working life of employees in service who are members of the plan.



10.   other provisions
      other provisions are intended to cover the risks arising from past or present events that are probable at the balance sheet date.
      they are estimates as regards their amount and expected period of use.



11.   income tax
      under the group tax regime agreement between vinci and those subsidiaries that are members of the tax group, tax savings made by the
      tax group connected with the tax losses of some subsidiaries are recognised by the parent company as income for the period.

      provisions for tax taken and reversed are recorded here.

      the increase in deferred expenses in 2012 was due to the issuance costs and redemption premiums incurred for €7.4 million in respect of the
      new loans obtained in the period (see note a.3 “financing activities” in the “key events in the period” section).
      deferred expenses at 31 december 2012 also include the balance of expenses and redemption premiums of the €500 million perpetual
      subordinated loan issued in 2006 (€2.8 million).

      at 31 december 2012, vinci’s share capital amounted to €1,443.4 million, represented by 577,347,352 shares of €2.5 nominal, all conferring
      the same rights.

      the share capital increases in the period, amounting to €335.7 million, are the result of subscriptions to the group savings scheme for
      €275.1 million, and the exercise of subscription options for a total of €60.6 million.

      the dividends paid in 2012 amounted to €947.5 million, corresponding to the final dividend in respect of 2011 for €652.6 million (€1.22 per
      share) and the interim dividend in respect of 2012 for €294.9 million (€0.55 per share).

      vinci has reserves (share premiums, merger and contribution premiums, reserves other than the statutory reserve) of an amount greater than
      the amount of all the treasury shares it owned directly or indirectly at 31 december 2012.

6.           other equity
             on 13 february 2006, vinci issued perpetual subordinated bonds for €500 million.

             issued at a price of 98.831%, this loan pays a fixed optional coupon of 6.25%, payable annually until november 2015. this is only due if vinci
             pays a dividend to its shareholders or if the company buys back its own shares during the reference period. after november 2015, the interest
             rate becomes variable and payable quarterly at the euribor three-month rate plus 3.75%. vinci may redeem the bonds at par in november
             2015 and subsequently at each interest payment date.

      vinci’s net financial position moved from a net financial surplus of €230.3 million at 31 december 2011 to net financial debt of €474.3 million
      at 31 december 2012, a difference of €704.6 million.

      the increase in long-term financial debt is attributable to the three issues of bonds made in 2012 for a total of €1,082 million and the two
      private placements totalling €175 million made in january 2012.

      the remaining €750 million outstanding on the syndicated bank loan, taken out in 2006 in an initial amount of €3 billion to finance the asf
      acquisition, was repaid in full in 2012.

      the cash management current accounts of related companies, shown under assets and liabilities, represent the balance of movements of
      cash between the subsidiaries and the holding company under the group’s centralised cash management system.

      marketable securities mainly comprise certificates of deposit and money market ucits with maturities of usually less than three months,
      whose carrying amount is close to their net asset value.

report of the statutory auditors
on the parent company financial statements
for the year ended 31 december 2012
      to the shareholders

      in accordance with our appointment as statutory auditors by your shareholders’ general meeting, we hereby report to you for the year ended
      31 december 2012 on:
      ˇˇ the audit of the accompanying financial statements of vinci sa;
      ˇˇ the justification of our assessments; and
      ˇˇ the specific verifications and information required by law.
      the financial statements have been approved by the board of directors. our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements, based
      on our audit.


1.    opinion on the parent company financial statements
      we conducted our audit in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france. those standards require that we plan and perform
      the audit in such a way as to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit consists
      in examining, by sampling or other selection methods, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the annual financial statements.
      an audit also consists in assessing the accounting principles used, significant estimates made and the overall presentation of the financial
      statements. we believe that the information that we have collected provides a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.
      in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above give a true and fair view of your company’s financial position, its assets and liabilities
      at 31 december 2012 and the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
      in france.


2.    justification of our assessments
      as required by article l.823-9 of the french commercial code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the
      following:
      ˇˇ as disclosed in note b.3 to the financial statements presenting the accounting rules and methods relating to shares in subsidiaries and
      affiliates, your company provides for impairment of investments in subsidiaries and affiliates whenever the cost of acquisition of the shares
      exceeds their value in use. we have assessed the assumptions underlying these estimates and verified the company’s calculations.
      these assessments were made as part of our audit of the annual financial statements taken as a whole and have therefore contributed to the
      formation of our opinion, given in the first part of this report.


3.    specific verifications and information
      we have also carried out, in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france, the specific verifications required by law.
      we have no comments to make as to the fair presentation and consistency with the annual financial statements of the information given in
      the report of the board of directors and in the documents addressed to the shareholders, with respect to the financial position and the annual
      financial statements.
      regarding the information provided in application of article l.225-102-1 of the french commercial code on the remuneration and benefits
      paid to company officers and on the commitments made to them, we have verified that the information is consistent with the financial state-
      ments or data having served to prepare those financial statements, and if applicable, with the information collected by your company from
      the companies it controls or that control it. on the basis of this work, we attest the exactness and fair presentation of this information.
      in accordance with french law, we have ascertained that the appropriate disclosures have been provided in the board of directors’ report with
      regard to the acquisition of shareholdings and controlling interests, the identity of shareholders and holders of voting rights.

                                                                   paris-la défense and neuilly sur seine, 7 february 2013

          person concerned: xavier huillard, chairman and chief executive officer of vinci and permanent representative of vinci, director of vinci
          energies.

          on 27 april 2012, vinci sold its stake in cegelec entreprise to vinci energies, namely 1,958,256,061 shares representing the entirety of that
          company’s authorised share capital. this transaction was completed at a price of €1,292 million.

          this agreement was authorised by the board of directors on 12 april 2012 and was concluded on 27 april 2012.

          agreements and commitments since the year-end close
          we have been advised of the following agreement that has been authorised by your board of directors.

          agreement between vinci and the company ytseuropaconsultants
          person concerned: yves-thibault de silguy, vice-chairman and senior director of the board of directors of vinci and managing director of
          the company ytseuropaconsultants.

          on 3 march 2010, the company entered into an assistance agreement with the company ytseuropaconsultants, a société à responsabilité limitée
          (limited liability company) with a sole shareholder. under the terms of this agreement, mr de silguy assists the chairman and chief executive
          officer in his role as representative of the vinci group, in particular in dealings with french or foreign public authorities, major clients, current
          or potential french or foreign shareholders, and with individual shareholders at the periodical meetings organised by the company for that
          purpose.

          this agreement was authorised by the board of directors at its meeting of 3 march 2010 and approved by the shareholders’ general meeting
          of 6 may 2010. it provides for fixed and non-reviewable remuneration of €27,500 excluding vat per month. the term of the agreement is
          12 months with effect from its approval by the shareholders’ general meeting, and it contains an automatic annual renewal clause.

          this agreement is examined every year by the audit committee, which ensures that remuneration paid is consistent with the services provided.
          acting on the advice of the audit committee, the board, meeting on 7 february 2012 to approve the annual financial statements for 2011,
          considered that there was no reason to terminate it.

          for the 2011 and 2012 financial years, vinci recognised a charge of €330,000 per year excluding vat in respect of this agreement.

          at its meeting on 5 february 2013, the board of directors, considering that the services provided by mr de silguy are valuable to the group
          and that the remuneration provided for in the agreement is consistent with the services provided, formally authorised its automatic renewal
          in 2013 and confirmed that the automatic renewals in 2011 and 2012 had taken place with its prior tacit authorisation.

      in accordance with article r. 225-30 of the french commercial code, we have been informed that the following agreements and commitments
      approved by the shareholders’ general meeting in previous financial years remained in force during the year.

      agreement with vinci deutschland gmbh
      on 28 june 2002, vinci entered into an agreement with its subsidiary vinci deutschland gmbh under the terms of which that subsidiary
      would, with effect from 1 july 2002, directly invest with vinci funds corresponding to the supplementary pension obligations agreed with its
      employees.

      in 2012, vinci recognised interest charges of €175,332.78 in respect of this agreement.

      refinancing of the loan granted by vinci to arcour
      for the purposes of financing certain costs of the project for the design and construction of the artenay-courtenay section of the a19 motor-
      way, vinci made available to arcour, under the terms of a loan agreement entered into on 31 january 2005, (i) a loan in a maximum principal
      amount of €550 million comprising a tranche a in a maximum principal amount of €500 million, and a tranche b in a maximum principal
      amount of €50 million, and (ii) a revolving credit in a maximum principal amount of €40 million.

      on 14 march 2008, arcour finalised the refinancing of the vinci loan with certain financial institutions.

      thus, arcour entered into a financing agreement in an amount of €625 million with the european investment bank (eib) and a group of arranger
      banking institutions consisting of bbva, calyon, fortis, ing and royal bank of scotland. the financing granted by the eib was in the form of a
      repayment loan of €200 million with a maturity of 37 years, subject to an interest-only period of 10 years. the financing provided by the group
      of commercial banks was a loan of €425 million, with a maturity of 10 years, repayable upon maturity.

      in the context of this transaction and by way of security for the obligations of arcour to the financial parties under the documents entered into
      for the purposes of the refinancing, vinci granted a pledge of financial instruments accounts covering the entirety of the arcour shares owned
      or to be owned by vinci.

      vinci also entered into a shareholders’ commitment agreement under the terms of which, in particular, vinci undertook to make capital
      contributions or to grant shareholders’ loans to arcour.

      on 25 march 2009, the shareholders, arcour and the inter-creditors agent amended the shareholders’ commitment agreement in order, in
      particular, to provide for an increase in the conditional shareholders’ construction commitments of all the shareholders (increased to €43 mil-
      lion), pro rata according to each shareholder’s stake in arcour’s capital, and for their availability period to be extended until 31 december 2013.
      vinci’s conditional shareholders’ construction commitments were thus increased from the original amount of €1,250,000 to an amount of
      €2,150,000.

      in 2012, vinci recognised interest income of €144,489.20 in respect of these agreements.

        shareholders’ agreement with asf holding
        on 18 december 2006, in the context of the financing of vinci concessions’ transfer of its 22.99% shareholding in asf to asf holding, vinci
        entered into a shareholders’ agreement with its subsidiary asf holding, the recipient of this shareholding, under which the two companies
        organise their relations within asf.

        under this agreement, the parties undertake, as majority shareholders of asf, to act in such a way as to ensure that the decisions made by the
        competent governing bodies of asf comply with:
        ˇˇ the principle of adopting and maintaining a policy of maximising dividend distribution depending on asf’s results and distributable reserves;
        ˇˇ the conditions precedent to any disposal by asf of escota shares owned by that company, as defined in asf’s and asf holdings’ syndicated
        bank loan agreements of €3.5 billion and €1.2 billion, respectively, signed on 18 december 2006.

        in addition, vinci undertakes:
        ˇˇ to ensure that vinci concessions returns to asf holding the sums that asf holding may have made available under the group cash pooling
        agreement, should any event of default occur under the asf holding syndicated loan of €1.2 billion;
        ˇˇ directly or indirectly to maintain a shareholding in asf that will ensure it the majority of the share capital and voting rights. this commit-
        ment will end once asf holding has increased its shareholding in asf so that it directly owns the majority of both the share capital and the
        voting rights.

        lastly, the parties agree that if, in the event of a sale, a third party acquires a blocking minority holding in asf, they will ensure that it first
        adheres to the shareholders’ agreement.

        the shareholders’ agreement was to remain in force for as long as any sum remained due to the banks under the syndicated loan agreement.
        since the syndicated loan was repaid early on 29 june 2012, the shareholders’ agreement automatically terminated on that date.

        in 2012, no payment was made by vinci in respect of these commitments.
