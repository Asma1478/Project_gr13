how the infinite yarn is born

for four years, aquafil has adopted the
life-cycle methodology for measuring
the environmental performance of its
products and identifying the stages
of the production process on which
there is more room for improvement.
this approach has made it clear nylon
yarn’s biggest impact is that it is made
up of raw materials. this has led to
the development of the econyl®
production system, which replaces the
raw material of non-renewable origin
with secondary raw material coming
from various recycled waste including
end-of-life fishing nets, carpet fluff*
and others.



*
 fluff is the top part of the carpet that occurs at the
end of its life cycle .

50 years
of aquafilslo
in october 2016, aquafilslo commemorated its 50th anniversary, celebrating with a formal event in
which the slovenian president, borut pahor, was the keynote speaker. more than 300 executives, state
officials and business partners attended the event.

for this occasion, a book was published that recounts the most significant moments in the story of
aquafilslo. it recalls the early days under the name yulon and brings the reader up-to-date, tracing
fundamental steps such as acquiring by aquafil and creating the econyl® regeneration plant.

since the group’s development is also based on responsibility for future generations, the slovenian
facility promoted for this occasion an initiative to help children from the local public nursery school.
thanks to the aquafil donation, the nursery will be able to buy two swings for children.

to constantly improve the environmental performance of products, it is necessary to act on all stages       the first step in the econyl® regeneration system is the econyl® reclaiming program:
of the production process, including those that are not directly controlled by aquafil, such as the         an internationally structured network for the collection of waste containing nylon. it is based on
provision of transport services, auxiliary raw materials and packaging.                                     partnerships with institutions, organisations, public and private consortia. over time, many of the

therefore, at the end of 2015, the group launched “econyl® qualified”, an ambitious project aimed
at stimulating excellence and innovation in the supply chain to make econyl® even more virtuous.            the recovered materials are diverse: from abandoned fishing nets in seabeds to carpeting, from rugs,
                                                                                                            special fabrics such as tulle to plastic components based on nylon.
the ultimate goal of the project was the creation of the “econyl® qualified” recognition, a qualification
that distinguishes suppliers involved in the econyl® yarn supply chain.                                     the collection takes place all over the world. the recovered polyamide 6 pre- and post-consumer

the econyl® qualified protocol, mainly related to the use of materials and the production process
management. compliance with the requirements can be ascertained by third party verifications.

during 2016, the project entered the central phase. thanks to the collaboration with four suppliers
who have been a pilot for the “product transport” and “tube production” respectively, the requirements
of econyl® qualified have been defined and tested.
the qualification will become mandatory in 2018 for all companies that want to become product or
service suppliers for the production and marketing of econyl® products.
