                                                      we take pleasure in presenting the 2010 edition of our corporate responsibility report.
                                                      with this publication, we want to underline our commitment to being a responsible

                                                      practice. in our understanding, the essence of corporate responsibility is the desire to
                                                      contribute to long-term, sustainable value creation. addressing social and environmental
                                                      challenges is key to this. at swiss re, we work towards these goals through many activities
                                                      across our company. we are glad to report that our efforts culminated in a number of
                                                      important achievements in 2010.

                                                      since this report strives to offer an honest and credible account of swiss re’s performance
                                                      as a responsible company, we are especially pleased that our endeavours have received
                                                      significant external recognition: for the third year running, we gained the insurance sector
                                                      leadership position in the dow jones sustainability indexes in 2010. as a recognised leader
                                                      in the field of corporate responsibility, we are also a signatory to the un global compact.
                                                      we will continue to implement its ten principles and regularly communicate on our progress.

                                                      reinsurance creates economic and social value by offering financial protection against risk.
                                                      in cooperation with clients both from the public and the private sector, we strive to develop
                                                      innovative solutions that further extend the range of risks covered. in 2010, the main focus ﻿
                                                      of these solutions was on natural catastrophes, adverse weather patterns and life and health
                                                      risks, especially in emerging countries. we also completed studies for a number of clients ﻿
                                                      on cost-effective adaptation measures to cope with the consequences of climate change;
                                                      previously we had helped develop the unique methodology of these studies as a leading

                                                      in our risk management, we made further progress in addressing environmental, social ﻿

                                                      transactions. the pioneering character of our sustainability risk framework was confirmed

                                                      responses to them. in 2010, we produced a series of new publications, covering topics from

                     we have a long-standing tradition to serve our stakeholders in wider society by acting as ﻿
                     a good corporate citizen. in 2010, we provided direct assistance to several development
                     projects, and rapidly set up relief support efforts after the tragic events in haiti and pakistan.
                     a special focus of the past year was our group-wide initiative to enhance our local
                     volunteering and charity programmes. many of our employees took full advantage of these
                     opportunities and got involved in community days or charity of the year events.

                     as a globally operating company, we pride ourselves on our collaborative working environ­
                     ment and the diversity of our staff. yet, we realise that there is still room for improvement. ﻿
                     in 2010, we set up an initiative to further advance diversity and inclusion in our company. ﻿
                     in its first year, this initiative put an emphasis on smoothing women’s way into the higher
                     layers of management.

                     our employees are a key group among our stakeholders and, to conclude, we would like to
                     address them directly. we know that it is their engagement, expertise and dedication that
                     underpin swiss re’s success in general and as a responsible company. we would like to take
                     this opportunity to extend our sincere thanks to them.

      climate change
      on a global scale, climate change is the biggest environmental challenge facing humanity.
      swiss re was one of the first organisations to realise its potential impact almost ﻿
      twenty years ago. it has since become an acknowledged thought leader on the topic
      and has developed several path-breaking initiatives, among them the greenhouse ﻿
      neutral programme, the coyou2 reduce and gain programme and – in partnership with
      other organisations – the economics of climate adaptation (eca) methodology.

      the group’s strategy to tackle climate change rests on four pillars:

      ̤̤ assess and manage risk: swiss re’s aim is to advance its knowledge about climate
         change risk, to quantify it and, where required, to integrate it into its underwriting and
         risk management framework.
      ̤̤ seize business opportunities: in response to its clients’ needs, swiss re is committed
         to seizing climate change-related market opportunities and developing appropriate
         solutions for adapting to and mitigating climate change.
      ̤̤ influence the business environment: swiss re’s aim is to raise awareness about
         climate change risks, actively disseminate its knowledge to all stakeholders and
         advocate a long-term, market-based policy framework.
      ̤̤ lead by example: swiss re has been greenhouse neutral since october 2003 and is
         committed to reducing its emissions per employee by 45% by 2013.

      a complete overview of swiss re’s activities related to climate change is available on our
      website at www.swissre.com/rethinking/climate/

the economy of the us gulf coast is largely
supported by the oil and gas industry. in total,
industrial assets in the coastal areas of texas,
mississippi, alabama and louisiana are worth
more than usd 2 trillion, around 90% of which
is owned by oil and gas companies. but wind

already costs the region about usd 14 billion
per year on average. economic growth, land
subsidence and climate change will lead to ﻿
a further increase in these costs.

company in the us, commissioned an ﻿
eca study to quantify local climate risks and
determine effective adaptation measures.
using swiss re’s expertise in natural catas­
trophe modelling and risk assessment, ﻿
the study found that economic losses to

per year by 2030, resulting in cumulative
losses of usd 350 billion.

switch to geothermal energy in munich
our munich location is one of the biggest in
the group, employing around 600 people. the
office building in the suburb of unterföhring
has a high level of energy efficiency and, since
2005, has been powered exclusively with
electricity from renewable sources. in 2010,
we took another significant step in improving
the building’s overall environmental perfor­m­
ance by changing over to geothermal energy.

the energy is provided by the “geothermie­
projekt unterföhring”, which is managed by
the local community. swiss re’s contract is
over a power input of 2.5 megawatts,
sufficient to cover the heating and warm water
needs of the entire office building. geothermal
energy is generated by extracting hot, “thermal”
water from below the earth’s surface and
transferring its heat energy to a district heating
network, through which it is distributed to ﻿
end users. geothermal energy has several
advantages: it is fully renewable, has a very
favourable co2 footprint, and unit prices are
both relatively low and stable. moreover,
investing in a geothermal plant creates local
employment and economic value-added.

came from a project of three small-scale ﻿
run-of-river hydropower stations in the sichuan
province of china. the three plants sell their
output of fully renewable energy to the central
china power grid, substituting electricity
gained from burning fossil fuels (ie coal). in
addition to reducing co2 emissions and
air pollution, the project has also created local
employment, initially through construction
work and later through operation and mainte­
nance. furthermore, the power station
contributes to grid stability, thus facilitating
economic activity in the area.
