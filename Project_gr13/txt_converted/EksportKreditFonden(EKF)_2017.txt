ekf’s business model
ekf is an independent public company. we are owned
by the danish ministry of industry, business and finan­cial
affairs and managed by a board of directors based
on the act on ekf denmark’s export credit agency.

on 1 january 2016, the export lending scheme
and ekf merged. the export lending scheme was
a state scheme providing loans to danish export trans-
actions, while ekf provided a guarantee covering the
actual credit risk. following the merger, ekf now also
offers loans to export transactions.

ekf’s equity and provisions must provide a reasonable
basis for our liabilities and future activities. ekf’s
equity defines the framework of ekf’s activity level,
since, under the current rules, ekf’s non-restricted
equity must consti­tute five to nine per cent of our
guarantee exposure and loans.

operational risks
operational risks, including compliance and reputation
risks, are the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, people and systems or from
external events, including legal risks. operational risk is
managed through internal regulations drawn up in order
to ensure the best possible control environment at ekf.
we seek to minimise operational risks by, for instance,
separation of duties between performance and control
of activities and by an authorisation structure.

compliance risks are managed by compliance &

of efficient processes to ensure that ekf meets
its obligations in accordance with relevant national
