environmental performance

mining and metal production are vital to the health of the u.s., global economies and modern society. doe run is
committed to promoting environmental compliance and stewardship throughout the organization. in 2015, company
employees received more than 22,237 training hours on subjects, including the environment and workplace
safety. the company also tracked and completed more than 25,000 environmental, health and safety tasks through
its enterprise task management system (etms). read more about our environmental commitments or browse our
data tables.

our employees

workplace safety is our highest value, and our subsidiary fabricated products inc. (fpi) reached 1.5 million hours
without a lost time accident in 2015 and achieved a perfect safety record for 16 years. while we celebrate these
safety achievements, we also mourn when accidents impact our team. in january 2015, doe run’s mining
operations tragically experienced a fatality at one of our mines and we lost a trusted and highly respected coworker
and friend. we worked with federal authorities to understand what caused this accident and to ensure all
precautions for safety are taken to best protect our employees.

one precaution we focus upon is reducing employee exposure to lead. in 2014, lead manufacturing and mining
companies across the industry introduced voluntary targets to reduce workforce lead exposure. the u.s.
occupational safety and health administration requires that employees of lead industry companies be removed and
reassigned from their jobs if their blood-lead levels exceed 50 micrograms per deciliter (μg/dl) on a six-month
average. doe run voluntarily reassigns employees if they reach blood-lead levels of 30 µg/dl.1

doe run has taken a protective approach by proactively monitoring employees’ blood-lead levels on a monthly
basis versus a quarterly or annual basis if they exceed our threshold. our target for 2015 was to reduce the number
of employees at each location who surpassed the threshold of 19 μg/dl. we achieved that target at our southeast
missouri mining and milling (semo) division and fpi, but missed our target at our resource recycling and
herculaneum operations. read more about our progress.

global outlook

in 2015, global demand for lead grew at a lower level than anticipated as china’s economic growth slowed. the
result was lower prices for base metal commodities, including lead. doe run adjusted to the cooling global economy
by postponing non-essential projects, reducing overtime where possible and, unfortunately, by reducing our
workforce. these decisions, though difficult, enabled the company to manage through a challenging time without
some of the more drastic measures taken by other companies in the industry.

despite the lower commodity pricing, the long-term outlook for lead, copper and zinc is promising. since the closure
of the doe run primary smelter in 2013, the company has diversified its customer portfolio in the global market and
has settled into its new business model as a global leader in exported lead concentrates. the change to the
company’s business model also impacted company spending with missouri vendors as materials related to primary
metal production were no longer required. the smelter closure also impacted u.s. metal imports and in 2015, the
u.s. imported record levels of lead metal. the majority of lead imports are utilized in motive and stationary batteries,
and advances in battery technologies provide a promising outlook for lead-based batteries for use in hybrid electric
cars and renewable energy storage. both markets are expected to experience strong growth. so, although lower

metal prices may prevail for a longer period, we believe recovery of metal prices will take place in late 2016. with
the measures we have put into place, we are well-poised for a market recovery.

the reputation of lead

as a member of several trade associations, doe run is a staunch advocate for open communication with
stakeholders and for greater understanding on how to use and reuse lead in a safe manner. most people do not
realize that lead-based batteries start nearly one billion vehicles every day. a day without lead would mean a day
without modern transportation, without medical radiation therapies, without security screening and much more.
improved communication efforts on the value of lead and greater education on the proper handling of lead are
necessary to build a better understanding among the public and policymakers.

as the largest lead mining company in the u.s., doe run has taken an active role in working alongside state and
federal government to help legislators learn more about our industry. in april 2015, doe run employees hosted a
“doe run day” at the missouri state capitol building. employees staffed tables with information on missouri
minerals, battery recycling, mining and remediation, and visited each state legislator’s office to share information on
our industry. the event successfully opened dialogue about the important role mining plays for missouri’s economy,
and the company intends to repeat the effort every couple of years.

at the federal level, doe run was invited by the u.s. office of accountability to respond to its critical materials
supply survey regarding u.s. access to critical materials that may have a strong value to our economy and national
security. doe run responded by explaining the importance of lead metal to the u.s. economy and to u.s. domestic
and international security. for example, lead is used to start all motive vehicles, provide emergency power for
mission-critical equipment, and for medical and military applications, all of which directly support our nation’s
defense.

our business divisions

southeast missouri mining and milling
division

the lifecycle of lead starts with exploration, which has
helped to identify and locate the six underground
mines of the southeast missouri mining and milling
division (semo). here, ore containing lead (galena),
zinc (sphalerite) and copper (chalcopyrite) is located,
blasted, hauled, crushed and hoisted to the surface,
then concentrated at doe run’s four mills. in
southeastern missouri’s viburnum trend, mining and
milling has taken place for more than 50 years and
produces approximately 250,000 tons of lead
concentrates annually.

doe run’s semo division also includes the glover
facility as of late 2013. a portion of the site, which ceased operations as a primary lead smelter in 2003, functions as
a warehouse and transloading facility.

steve batts, vice president – semo operations
semoinfo@doerun.com

metals division

doe run’s resource recycling facility has served
metals customers and the battery manufacturing
industry as one of the world’s largest single-site lead
recycling centers since opening in 1991. resource
recycling has the capacity to recycle and recover
nearly 175,000 tons of refined lead and lead alloys
from more than 13.5 million recycled lead-acid
batteries annually. other recycled materials include
ammunition, lead-bearing glass and lead-based paint
chips.

in late 2013, doe run closed its herculaneum primary
smelting operations. the company continues to
operate its refinery, strip mill, and alloying and casting
operations at the herculaneum site to produce unique lead alloy products. with the closure of the smelter, doe
run’s primary smelting division was combined with its resource recycling division to better serve customers as
the metals division.

safety at the core
   sustainability2015.doerun.com /committed-safe-work/

sixteen years is a long time to maintain a record of no lost-time accidents. just ask fabricated products inc.’s (fpi)
facility in casa grande, arizona. employees there have worked 1.5 million hours with no lost-time accidents, totaling
more than 1.5 million consecutive safe hours at its two locations.

“if you would have told me 15 years ago, when we had one full year under our belt, that 16 years later we’d still be
adding to this record, i doubt i would have believed it,” said tim rango, sales, human resources and safety manager
for fpi, a subsidiary of doe run specializing in metal fabrication. “but today, knowing our team and the culture we
have here, i believe we have what it takes to continue our record long into the future.”

fpi’s casa grande facility fabricates lead and lead alloy products, while the facility in vancouver, washington,
produces lead oxides for the battery industry.

“fpi employees work in an environment with mechanical equipment, mobile equipment, and heavy suspended loads
of hot or molten materials. it is critical that we have strong safety processes in place to protect our employees, keep
our operations running smoothly and provide quality products to our customers,” says mark yingling, vice president
– environmental, health & safety at doe run. “our fpi employees have created an exemplary culture of safety, and
we congratulate them for their commitment to keeping each other safe year over year.”

when asked what the key has been to such a safe environment, dave olkkonen, general manager, says it starts
with hiring for the right fit. “our first step is to find employees who share our common values of safety and respect for
one another. we want to be a good fit for them, and they have to also share in our commitment to our safety
performance. it is understood that we must always find a way to do a job safely, or we won’t do it at all.

“the division rewards employees with a lunch celebration when they achieve good results. we invite employees to
ask our leadership team questions anytime they have questions or suggestions,” olkkonen said. “by promoting
communication, we’re fostering a level of respect and team work that carries over into the workday. we watch out for
one another.”

working safely protects lives, jobs and the community

just ask steve rhoades, general supervisor at resource recycling, doe run’s secondary lead smelter located in
southeastern missouri. in 2015, doe run’s resource recycling facility invested in new measures to keep both
employees and the environment safer.

“our people are what keep us in business, and our community allows us to operate, so it’s critical that we take steps
to work safely and protect our employees and neighbors,” said rhoades.

doe run took a big step in improving air quality in 2015 with a $1.2 million ventilation project that reduces exposure
to potential airborne lead particles at resource recycling’s metal refinery. in order to reduce the potential for fugitive
emissions from the refinery and other process buildings, the facility’s operations are enclosed in negative pressure
buildings. negative pressure is produced by large ventilation fans that draw the air in through ductwork and
eventually through baghouses, which collect lead particles and other airborne materials before releasing the air
outside.

“we are always working to lower employee exposure to airborne lead,” said bruce chamberlain, operations
manager, metals division. “doe run made several improvements in this area, and the ventilation is a part of that
success. we set our levels for employees well below the government requirements, and in 2015 our average blood-
lead level for metal division employees was 15.01 micrograms per deciliter (μg/dl). we focus on this for continuous

improvement and establish metrics to help us continue the path of reduced exposure.”

the project construction took place over eight months and includes a 250-horsepower fan that can draw between
110-120 thousand cubic feet of air per minute. missouri-based lee mechanical fabricated and installed the system.

safety measures

one of doe run’s core values is being safe – protecting one another. this means a commitment from the company
to continually invest in safety programs and equipment to protect employees and neighbors, and a commitment from
employees to operate safely and watch out for fellow co-workers.


safety gloves

employees protect their hands by wearing different types of
gloves based on the task to be completed.


climbing harness

climbing harnesses are used by employees to ensure work
conducted at elevation is completed safely.

ventilation fan

in 2015, the company invested in a $1.2 million ventilation
project at the resource recycling facility.

behind the numbers

total case incident rates, lost time accidents, blood-lead
levels. what do they have in common? lower is better when it
comes to employee safety.

“there are various ways to measure progress in keeping
employees safe,” said justin province, environmental, health &
safety (ehs) manager. “in our industry, we routinely work with
large equipment and around molten metal. clear safety
processes and open communication among employees helps
us create a safe, productive environment. we must always
maintain our focus and dedication to safety.”

doe run tracks and reports on blood-lead levels (the trace
amount of lead the body may absorb through exposure),
accidents and incident rates monthly and annually in each of
the above categories, and in 2015 the company identified
several areas for focused improvement.

“we are always monitoring our health and safety numbers, and
identifying ways to make adjustments to improve safety at our
facilities,” said yingling.

throughout 2015, doe run analyzed the safety performance

numbers and the related incidents. in many cases, these lost time accidents involved soft tissue injuries, like deep
bruises, muscle pulls or sprains, that take time to heal. while these types of injuries are common among any type of
industrial job, doe run wanted to assess what changes could be made to minimize accidents like these.

“we are fortunate to have a knowledgeable and experienced workforce,” said yingling. “being too familiar with a job
can sometimes lead to overconfidence. it’s important to stay alert and look out for potential dangers through
continued assessment.”

doe run reassessed its performance against the mining industry’s coresafety® program, which the company first
introduced in 2013. building on the company’s progress, ehs team members conducted a companywide
assessment in each of the program’s 20 key areas. following assessment, the coresafety team determined they
would focus primarily on these categories: collaborating and communication, risk management, change
management, assurance, and management systems coordination.

the central coresafety team focused on collaboration and communication first to engage more employees in the
process. the initial team of more than 75 employees (across all locations, divisions and, including, both hourly and
salary staff) discussed how doe run could foster stronger two-way communication about safety issues. location
teams meet monthly to share ideas, research solutions and, when appropriate, present suggested improvements to
division leadership teams so that any necessary corrective measures are taken.

one of the specific areas of focus was hand safety. “after investigating past incidents related to hand burns, the
coresafety team researched alternative hand protection products and identified a different glove that better
protects employees,” stated province. “after introducing the new glove and processes for the casting area, the
number of hand-related injuries has greatly reduced.”

separately, the team also responded to employee suggestions to research cooling gear for those who work closest
to the furnaces. the company purchased the new gear, which keeps employees cooler and more comfortable.

success one microgram at a time

doe run’s standards for workforce exposure to lead are more stringent than government requirements, and monthly
progress is measured to the microgram, one millionth of a gram. in 2015, the average blood-lead levels
companywide declined to 11.02 micrograms per deciliter (μg/dl) and the number of employees who recorded a
blood-lead level of greater than 19 ug/dl also declined from 223 to 188.

“doe run proactively reassigns workers who have a blood-lead level of 30 µg/dl to a job area with reduced
exposure,” stated mark yingling. “that’s 20 points less than the standard set by the occupational health and safety
administration (osha) for medical reassignment.” yingling attributes the success to concerted efforts at each
division. “we also counsel employees who cross a certain threshold to identify particular areas of exposure, and
work on individualized plans to address those areas.”

certifications and achievements
   sustainability2015.doerun.com /certifications-and-achievements/


doe run’s success depends on achieving high
standards for its operations and safety. certifications
and awards are measures of the company’s progress.

third mine and mill earns iso certification

in 2015, a third doe run mine and mill operation –
brushy creek mine and mill – completed its iso
14001:2004 certification for environmental
management. developed by the international
organization for standardization (iso), the iso
14001:2004 certification helps companies set
operational goals and maintain an environmental
management system.

“continuous improvement is a way of life when it comes
                                                                       brushy creek mine and mill iso certification

run. “completing the iso certification process helps
the company develop a framework to analyze the
environmental challenges we face, and then identify
areas where we can implement consistent practices
across our operations, and fine-tune processes that
may be specific to an individual mine or mill.”

brushy creek mine and mill achieved iso certification over a six-month period, which included a rigorous on-site
assessment from a third-party iso registrar to refine the site’s procedures and enhance environmental
performance.

during the iso certification process, doe run audited the efficiency and potential environmental impact of current
operations at brushy creek mine and mill. then, the team developed a management system to reduce
environmental impact and set specific targets and timelines for improvement.

“third-party auditing of our progress is one of the most valuable features of iso,” said anderson. “quarterly auditing
by an internal team and an annual audit conducted by a third party helps us track our progress against the iso
14001 standard. outside auditors assist us by looking at our programs with a fresh perspective and sharing
information on the latest industry trends.”

at brushy creek mine and mill, internal teams identified several solutions to everyday operational obstacles as part
of the iso auditing process. for example, the underground crew noted that traditional sticker labels for containers
sometimes disintegrated in the damp environment, which could create confusion about what is stored inside.
employees researched alternative methods to label containers underground, ultimately moving to durable, color-
coded zip ties that could withstand the environment.

“changing the label system was a simple solution, and it makes a big difference in how we work,” said anderson.

the experience that the environmental and mine operation teams gained during the previous iso certification audits
at the company’s sweetwater mine and mill and fletcher mine and mill made for a more efficient certification
process at brushy creek mine and mill. the team’s knowledge ultimately reduced the process by several months.

in 2016, doe run’s buick mine and mill will be implementing some of the environmental management best
practices developed at the other facilities to prepare for the iso certification process in 2017. casteel mine and no.
29 mine will also undergo iso certification in 2017.

“pursuing certifications like iso help us in our goal to meet our commitment to remain good stewards of the
resources we share with our stakeholders and communities of interest,” said anderson.

doe run’s resource recycling facility has held an iso 14001:2004 certification since 2003. additionally,
herculaneum, resource recycling and fabricated products inc.’s (fpi) vancouver, washington, facilities maintain
iso 9001:2008 certification for quality management systems.

mine rescue achievements

maintaining a safe workplace requires a team effort, and doe run reinforces safety and emergency preparedness
through regular employee training. in 2015, doe run employees completed 16,687 safety-related training hours.
the mine rescue teams also complete eight additional hours of training monthly and participate annually in mine
rescue competitions to keep their critical safety response skills sharp.

in july 2015, doe run’s maroon mine rescue team earned the overall champion title at the northern regional mine
rescue contest. the event tested 10 mine rescue teams’ abilities to handle emergency situations underground.

other 2015 accomplishments of the mine rescue teams include:

   the maroon team won best in state at the missouri mine rescue association contest held in rolla, missouri.
    the gray team finished in third place in the team technical competition at the southeast regional mine
    rescue contest in maysville, kentucky.
    at the same competition in kentucky, the gray team’s captain, wayne marlin, earned first place in the written
    team trainer test.

while mine rescue contests are competitive events, participants value each team’s commitment to safety above all
else. in 2015, doe run’s denny dickerson was inducted into the missouri mine rescue hall of fame for his many
years of service as a skilled mine rescuer. he was nominated by another mine rescue team doe run regularly faces
in competition.

fpi reached 1.5 million safe hours

doe run’s dedication to safety extends to its manufacturing operations. fpi, which manufactures lead-based
products, achieved 1.5 million hours without a lost time accident in 2015. this achievement represents more than 16
years of safe work at fpi’s casa grande, arizona, facility and 10 years of safe work at its facility in vancouver,
washington. this achievement demonstrates how each team plays a critical role in fulfilling doe run’s commitment
to safety. read more about doe run’s employee safety programs.

national communication recognition

doe run received an apex award for publication excellence from the business communications
report for its 2014 sustainability report website. the award is based on excellence in graphic design,
editorial content and overall communications effectiveness. this is the fourth time doe run has
earned apex recognition for its annual sustainability report.

treating missouri waterways with care
   sustainability2015.doerun.com /treating-missouri-waterways-care/

doe run’s water management approach is simple: if it falls on our operations or is part of our processes, it’s our
responsibility to manage. water plays a vital role in the company’s mining, milling and recycling operations – and it is
also vital for recreational activities and the economies of the communities where doe run operates.

“it’s important that we care for this valuable resource by minimizing our operations’ impact on the water at our
properties” said mark yingling, vice president – environmental, health and safety. “we have invested millions of
dollars collecting and treating water at our properties.”

doe run invested $13.2 million in 2015 to increase its water management capacity by building a water treatment
plant at buick mine and mill. the company partnered with engineers at woodard curran to build the facility – the
second of five planned water treatment plants for its mines and mills. read about the first plant at brushy creek
mine and mill.

the plant’s flocculation and chemical precipitation technology helps the company meet water permit limits more
efficiently. previously, water at the buick mine and mill site was pumped to the tailings storage facility, where metals
and other impurities settled out of the water to meet permit limits before being released to struthers creek via a
meander system. the new plant relies on a process similar to municipal water treatment plants to collect and treat
water that comes in contact with doe run’s operations. after treatment, the water released meets the permit limits.

“buick mine is one of our larger mines, which means we have a higher volume of naturally occurring water to
manage here than at some of our other sites,” said amber nipper, water treatment specialist at doe run’s southeast
missouri mining and milling (semo) division. “to accommodate the additional treatment needs, we built the buick
plant on a much larger scale.”

when operating at full capacity, the plant can process up to 10,000 gallons of water per minute. by comparison, a
similar, though smaller scale, plant at brushy creek mine and mill treats 4,000 gallons per minute. this additional
capacity means doe run is prepared for high rain fall at the site, because any storm water flow must also be
collected and sent to the plant for treatment before it can be released.

“missouri weather can be unpredictable, and we often experience very wet springs, falls and winters, as we did in
2015. in addition, the amount of water we encounter underground in the mines can vary based on the area we are
actively mining,” said samantha anderson, environmental programs manager at semo. “we were very deliberate in
designing a plant that can operate reliably and flexibly in even the most challenging conditions.”

the company also created a basin to collect and retain storm water at no. 29 mine in 2015. to learn about other
2015 environmental improvement projects at doe run, read fulfilling environmental commitments.

in 2016, doe run will build two additional water treatment plants. a plant at sweetwater mine and mill will manage
water collected from the site. the new plant in viburnum will treat process waters from casteel mine and no. 29
mine, as well as storm water from nearby tailings sites. a fifth and final water treatment plant is planned for 2017.

charting a new course for west fork stream

in 2014 and 2015, doe run’s water management efforts included redirecting a portion of the west fork stream that
ran across company property, due to a land depression that occurred in the stream and subsequent decrease in the
stream’s water flow. doe run requested and received permission from the u.s. army corps of engineers and the
missouri department of natural resources to create a new channel for the stream in order to protect its flow.

“the west fork stream flows across our property and downstream to other property owners, so it was very
important for us to work collaboratively with our neighbors, county commissioners and regulators as we addressed
this issue,” said yingling. “together, we determined that we needed to reroute a 2,350-foot portion of the west fork
stream to preserve its flow.”

with a team of contractors, regulators and state organizations, the company engineered a new channel for west
fork stream, located approximately 400 feet from the original channel, during summer 2014. regulatory agencies,
including missouri department of natural resources, missouri geological survey and u.s. army corp of
engineers, provided oversight and support throughout the process. in total, doe run invested approximately $1
million in the project.

“the new channel performed even better than expected,” said yingling. “within a few days, fish began swimming
around the rocks covering the floor of the new creek channel, and aquatic plants started growing after just a few
weeks. in our talks with local property owners, we heard that they are pleased with the creek’s performance and
with the native plants we planted alongside the banks to stabilize the channel.”

doe run hopes to receive final approval from the u.s. army corp of engineers and missouri department of natural
resources to make the channel permanent by summer 2016. the company will fill cracks in the old channel with
clay, and revegetate it with water-friendly plants. it will serve as a flood plain in the event that the new channel
overflows during heavy rainfall.

                                                  doe run worked with contractors, regulators and state organizations to engineer a new
                                                     channel for west fork stream, located approximately 400 feet from the original

   sustainability2015.doerun.com /environmental-commitments/

in 2015, doe run improved efficiency and reduced the environmental impact of its southeast missouri mining and
milling division (semo) operations by investing in two environmental projects. these projects helped fulfill the
company’s environmental commitments as part of an agreement with the state of missouri and the environmental
protection agency (epa).

“doe run is delivering on the promises we made to our local communities to improve our shared environment,” said
jerry pyatt, doe run president and ceo. “since reaching the agreement in 2010, we have invested more than $2
million in a series of environmental improvement projects at our semo facilities, as well as at several schools
throughout southeastern missouri. these investments support our continued promise to operate our business in a
sustainable manner, minimize our impact and benefit our communities.”

projects harnessing natural resources

not only does doe run mine the valuable metallic minerals in southeast missouri, the company also relies on
natural resources like water to support and, in some cases, improve operations. in 2015, doe run implemented an
alternative way to heat and cool buildings by tapping into geothermal energy, and thereby reduce its impact to the
environment.

doe run installed geothermal heating, ventilation and air conditioning (hvac) systems to improve energy efficiency
at brushy creek mine and mill’s surface building – which houses offices and employee change rooms – as well as
the semo central office in viburnum. the geothermal systems rely on the earth’s constant temperature and a
closed-loop system that recirculates water through heat pumps to improve efficiency. electric compressors and the
pumps help control the temperature of air that heats or cools the buildings. using 25 percent to 50 percent less
electricity than conventional heating or cooling systems, these systems also reduce carbon dioxide and greenhouse
gas emissions.

in the winter, the water flowing through these pipes absorbs heat from the earth and circulates it through a heat
pump, where it warms air that is blown through the hvac system to heat the building. in the summer, the heat pump
draws heat from the building into the water pipes. the cooler water absorbs the heat from the air, and cooled air is
sent back into the building. employees can control the temperature of the building by using thermostats.

“while we experience hot summers and cold winters above ground, the temperature a few feet below the earth’s
surface remains relatively consistent, approximately 60 degrees fahrenheit,” said eric van de mark, civil engineer
and project manager at doe run. “the geothermal hvac systems harness that constant temperature for more
efficient temperature control. by tapping into this renewable energy source, we’re decreasing our overall energy
use, environmental impact and spending.”

doe run invested $1 million in this project, and worked with microgrid energy of st. louis, lee mechanical of park
hills, missouri, and ridge runner of salem, missouri, to install the geothermal hvac systems.

many of doe run’s other environmental investments in 2015 focused on water management. learn more here.

projects managing natural resources

this year also marked the completion of a four-year, $23 million process to construct concentrate enclosure systems
at all four of doe run’s mill facilities as part of the environmental commitments of the 2010 agreement. the
enclosures store the lead concentrate that results from doe run’s milling process. the lead concentrates are

eventually transported around the globe to be processed into lead metal and alloys.

doe run invested approximately $8.4 million to construct the final lead concentrate enclosure and baghouse at
fletcher mill in 2015.

“each of the facilities filter air within the enclosure and use a negative-pressure ventilation system to minimize the
potential of emissions as a result of lead concentrate handling,” said van de mark. “the lead concentrate
enclosures help us maintain the quality of our lead concentrates by protecting them from wind, rain and snow, and
also reduce potential fugitive emissions. we have since seen improvements in our air monitoring.”

a path forward

doe run continues to manage other environmental projects as part of the 2010 consent decree, including
implementation of environmental management systems at several of its mines and mills, and remediation of the
herculaneum smelter property. while doe run has completed a significant portion of its agreement, the company is
committed to exploring new ways to continue reducing its impact and improving its operations.

community projects

doe run invested in several other projects from 2012-2014 that brought environmental improvements to schools in
the communities in which it operates as part of the agreement.

solar panels

doe run invested $500,000 in the installation of solar panels and energy-efficiency upgrades at herculaneum high
school, which are projected to save the school more than $44,000 annually.

school bus retrofits

the company issued grants totaling $300,000 to seven missouri school districts. these grants funded upgrades to
retrofit diesel-powered school bus engines that can reduce exhaust emissions by up to 90 percent. missouri-based
central states bus sales inc. helped perform the improvements.

school lab cleanouts

doe run also contributed $200,000 to help local schools safely dispose of chemical waste from science labs and
darkrooms.

on track with reclamation
   sustainability2015.doerun.com /on-track-with-reclamation/

when st. joseph lead company, the predecessor to doe run, constructed a railroad line through herculaneum in
1890, the company probably never imagined that those same tracks would help a new mississippi river shipping
facility prosper 125 years later.

doe run and its predecessors built and expanded the infrastructure that established and grew the town of
herculaneum – by river, rail and road. that same river and rail access now supports the expansion of new industry
for the area through the riverview commerce park llc (rcp) shipping facility, and fulfills part of doe run’s plans
for the closure and repurposing of the company’s primary smelter location. rcp capitalizes on the existing
infrastructure to ship materials downriver.

“the railroad line plays a critical role in transporting materials to rcp. in fact, our rail access helped us double our
shipping capacity in 2015,” said mark denton, project manager at rcp.

expansion to the infrastructure at the river’s edge also increased rcp’s capacity to accommodate more shipments
and improve the efficiency of operations. the port doubled in size with the construction of a second loading dock
and a new barge fleet staging area where barges can park. rcp began using the staging area in spring 2015, and
opened the second loading dock in spring 2016.

“our smelting operations were a major economic driver in herculaneum, so we are pleased that our work to
remediate and repurpose the property helped bring new industry to the area,” said chris neaville, asset
development director for doe run. “as we continue the reclamation process at the herculaneum smelter property,
we hope to identify additional ways the land can benefit local businesses and the community.”

remediation of the 18-acre port site took place with oversight from the missouri department of natural resources
(mdnr) voluntary cleanup program and epa region 7. the remediation included installing a three-foot-thick cap
layer of soil and rock across the property, which was completed in 2015. rcp has submitted the completion report
for the site to mndr and is awaiting final approval for the work.

other reclamation work at the herculaneum site in 2015 included moving a large amount of slag (a glassy, sand-like
material leftover from smelting) situated on the north end of the property to a new slag storage area at the south end
of the property. when work is completed at the site, the storage area will be capped with soil to protect the slag from
rain or wind. slag remediation is expected to be completed in 2020. while doe run’s refinery and strip mill will
continue to operate, plans are underway to dismantle the plant’s furnace buildings in 2017, clearing the way for
more new economic opportunities in herculaneum.

additional reclamation progress

there have been thousands of lead mines in missouri over the centuries. doe run works to improve the
environment through remediation of historic lead mining sites. by implementing these clean-up projects, doe run
continues to be good stewards of our land and minerals. in total, doe run invested more than $63 million in
environmental spending, including remediation, in 2015.

    jasper county: in 2015, doe run completed remediation at three historic lead sites operated by a former
    subsidiary, kansas explorations, inc. at jasper, isherwood and snapp. these efforts included excavation of
    soil and mine waste, and replanting native vegetation at the properties. the company also piloted an
    innovative way to successfully recover metals from tailings, which may be useful in future remediation
    projects. doe run will provide ongoing maintenance at the snapp and isherwood sites to ensure that plants

are growing and address any erosion that occurs. a private land owner is evaluating the opportunities to
repurpose the jasper site, located alongside the highway, for commercial real estate development.

glover: doe run continued efforts to dismantle this
former smelter, which currently serves as a transloading
facility. in 2015, crews removed two baghouses from
the glover facility, and received approval from mdnr to
cap the slag pile. construction on this cap will be
completed in 2016.

detective work 1,200 feet underground
   sustainability2015.doerun.com /mine-exploration/

successful mining starts with strong investigative skills and sound interpretation skills. “we are using data to help
create a picture of what’s underground, long before we ever sink a mine shaft and cut a drift (underground tunnel),”
said george moellering, exploration manager at doe run’s southeast missouri mining and milling (semo) division.
“it’s a lot like putting together a puzzle without knowing in advance what the end image looks like.

“we collect data from core samples 1 and historical geological information known about an area, and then begin
interpreting that data to provide us with a picture of what we believe is taking place underground. based on the data,
we estimate tonnage and the ore grade2. if it appears the grade and tonnage provide a reasonable economic
return, we begin developing the area for mining.”

determining economic value

before a new ore body is determined to have sufficient economic value to mine, several teams evaluate criteria,
including ore grade, the distance from existing mined areas to the ore body, elevation and costs to reach the ore
body.

as a company, doe run maintains a core library dating back to approximately 1949 when predecessor st. joseph
lead company explored what is today known as the viburnum trend. the library contains samples from more than
10,000 surface drill holes. the successful exploration and subsequent mining of this area of southeast missouri has
earned the viburnum trend a global reputation as the second-largest lead mining district in the world.

in 2012, the company began its review process for completing mining in this area of the brushy creek mine. as part
of their protocol, doe run reviews all past surface and underground prospecting data (both log books and core
samples) and checks in with work crews to discuss any significant underground mineral observations to ensure that
valuable mineralization will not be stranded and unattainable. during this process, the mine geology group noted
copper mineralization had been observed in sections of the mine floor during the mining crew’s final pass through
the area.

the review processes identified the core log entries from 1981, which supported the initial rationale for mining the
area.

doe run’s core room

measuring core samples

core samples are cylinder mineral samples generally 1-5” in
diameter drilled out of an area to determine the geologic and
chemical makeup.


examining mineral make-up

the core room contains samples from more than 10,000
surface drill holes. geologists use bright lights and magnifying
glasses to carefully examine samples.

archiving data

doe run maintains a core library dating back to approximately
1949. geologists log the minerals identified in each sample to
inform future drilling.

“our mine geologists reviewed the core samples that indicated
six ore runs were originally identified in the area of the brushy
creek mine,” said moellering. “five of those ore runs
represented the upper zone of the bonneterre formation,
which we had been mining for decades. the sixth ore run on
the core sample represented a new zone on a previously
unmined level of the mine, some 100 feet below our mined
areas, near the lamotte sandstone.”

this sixth run, indicated in the core sample, was ignored over
the years because a series of surface exploration drilling did
not suggest strong mineralization. furthermore, once mining in
the upper portion of the bonneterre formation took place,
surface drilling to the lower ore zone was not possible and
underground jackhammer drilling methods were not capable of
reaching the lower ore zone.

separately, these two puzzle pieces seemed insignificant, but
when placed together in context, they revealed something
completely different.

based on these two findings, the historic core logs and newly observed mineralization, the mine team began
underground exploration with a diamond drill in august 2012. and over the next several months, crews drilled 48
holes that indicated mineralization existed from the floor of the last mining pass at 122 feet elevation all the way to
35 feet below sea level. in some places, the mineralization was 150 feet thick. most surprising, from a geological
standpoint, was that the highest grade ore was located at the point of contact between the bottom of the bonneterre
formation and the lamotte sandstone.

as a result of the exploration, 11 separate areas (known as ore blocks) were identified as prospects. the final
tonnage for the combined blocks was estimated at more than 430,000 tons of lead, zinc and copper ore with an ore
grade about three times the mineralization traditionally found in the area.

it took development crews approximately eight months to develop this unique mining zone in order for mine crews to
gain access to the ore.

“getting to this ore body created some challenges,” said randy hanning, mine operations manager. “this is the first
ore body next to the lamotte sandstone, which was a new situation for us. the sandstone is pretty porous as
opposed to our traditional mine horizons that are in dolomite, a much harder and more stable host rock.” to
compensate, crews made modifications to the mine design in order to respond to the mine conditions and ore grade.

addressing ventilation requirements at that depth also required a different approach with the mine crews drilling a
125-by-6-foot opening through the roof of the new area to the floor of the previous area to improve ventilation.
expedited advancements by the development crew to the lower zone allowed production from the area to begin in
june of 2014. the extra effort has paid off with high mineralization of galena (lead), sphalerite (zinc) and
chalcopyrite (copper).

“unlike our extraction in the bonneterre zone, where we have long understood the pattern and elevation of the ore,
the deep ore zone mineralization at brushy creek is located at a greater depth – nearly sea level – and the mineral
content from one mining advance to the next is less predictable,” explained chris hogan, brushy creek mine
geologist. “so far, we have been successful in recovering nearly 100,000 tons of this resource between june 2014
and the end of 2015, but we still have only a portion of the puzzle put together for this area, so we believe we have a
long way yet to go. this is what makes exploration so rewarding, and is what extends the life of our mines.”

and chemical makeup.
(2) ore grade is based on the concentration of minerals found in the ore or host rock.

growing partnerships through responsible forestry
   sustainability2015.doerun.com /responsible-forestry/

doe run’s commitment to be responsible with the resources in its care extends from the minerals mined
underground to the land above. as part of this promise, doe run oversees more than 70,000 acres of land, including
35,000 acres of forests located around its operations in several counties in southeast missouri.

“many people see timber as a non-renewable resource because trees are removed in the process. this couldn’t be
further from the truth,” said dave patterson, forester at doe run. “in fact, part of responsible forestry is harvesting
some trees to give other growing trees room to thrive. some trees can be harvested every year into the foreseeable
future to provide timber-based products and valuable jobs when a forest is sustainably managed.”

in 2015, doe run-managed forests provided approximately 3 million board feet of timber used to create forest
products, such as railroad cross ties, hardwood flooring, steel mill blocking, pallet material and cabinets. one
company even uses the timber to make barrels for wine and spirits right here in missouri.

doe run partnerships grow missouri’s economy (ec9)

in 2015, doe run supported missouri businesses by spending more than $153 million with 632 missouri vendors.
this accounts for 43 percent of total company spending.

doe run’s vision for sustainable forestry

sustainable forestry means taking responsibility for the overall health of the ecosystem. doe run divides its forests
into stands – sections of land up to 40 acres where trees and soil have similar characteristics. forestry experts
closely monitor the growth and health of each stand, and approximately every 15 to 20 years, doe run hires local
loggers to harvest trees in a particular stand. a sawmill in boss, missouri, cuts those logs into green lumber, which is
then purchased by local operations, such as a flooring plant and pallet-making company.

harvesting trees in this systematic way allows doe run to provide timber to local partners, while also maintaining
the ecological balance of the land. the surviving trees then have enough room in nutrient-rich soil to grow big and
strong.

“when determining where to harvest, we take into consideration factors like the natural topography, soil, erosion
patterns, water quality and the wildlife that live in that ecosystem of the forest,” said patterson. “from there, we
identify whether some trees need to be thinned out so stronger trees can grow to maturity. we also evaluate if we
need to plant additional trees to help that ecosystem flourish. doe run’s goal for our responsible forestry is to work
with mother nature and not disrupt the natural balance of our land.”

if an area of the forest needs to be replanted, crews plant the appropriate tree species to thrive in that environment.
as of 2015, doe run has replanted approximately 600,000 seedlings throughout its forested land in southeast
missouri.

the power of missouri white oak

white, black and red oak make up approximately 75 to 80 percent of doe run’s harvested timber. most of the timber
harvested from doe run’s forests supports products at a number of local companies. white oak in particular is
highly desired for barrel making, which makes it a valuable local resource for independent stave company, the

world’s largest supplier of staved barrels for wine and spirits, based in lebanon, missouri.

“white oak trees grow slowly, which means they have more rings when they are harvested,” said justin nichols, log
procurement manager at independent stave. “the rings in older trees are important in cooperage, or barrel making,
because they provide a deeper flavor as the spirits or wine soak into the barrel. white oak’s chemical complexity
offers a multitude of options for creating different flavors.

doe run serves as one of independent stave’s top ten suppliers of white oak timber. in 2015, independent stave
purchased more than 200,000 board feet of white oak from doe run to craft barrels for wineries and distilleries
around the world.

“we do not harvest any of our own timber. we rely on more than 2,000 missouri suppliers to provide the white oak
we need,” said nichols. “our partnership with doe run helps us provide customers with high-quality barrels, and
supports jobs right here in lebanon.”

from bark to barrels

cooperage, or barrel making, is a multi-step process that can take three to six months to complete. because
independent stave’s white oak barrels are highly desired to age some of the finest wines and spirits around the
world, each barrel is closely inspected prior to distribution to ensure high-quality standards are met.


step 1

sawmills cut logs into vertical planks called staves. white oak
staves contain a natural substance called tyloses that makes
the wood watertight.

step 2

the staves are formed into a barrel shape by applying heat,
steam and pressure. metal hoops hold the staves in the curved
shape.

step 3

the inside of a completed barrel is toasted to create a
blackened surface called char. charring releases sugar in the
wood that provides unique flavors for wine and whiskey stored
in the barrel.

corporate governance
   sustainability2015.doerun.com /governance/corporate-governance/

the doe run resources corporation, doing business as the doe run company (doe run), is privately held by the
new york-based renco group inc.

as a global supplier of lead, copper, and zinc concentrates and lead metals and alloys, doe run is guided by a
nine-member executive team. the team consists of the president and chief executive officer; vice president –
finance and chief financial officer; vice president – information technology; vice president – law; vice president –
sales and marketing; vice president – human resources and community relations; vice president – exploration; vice
president – environmental, health and safety; and vice president of semo operations. the executive team is 88
percent male and 88 percent caucasian, and encompasses an age range of 45-70 years. the team includes one
female and one person of hispanic heritage. their compensation is determined using market-based data and
standard industry practices.

these individuals are responsible for setting the business strategy and organizational structure of doe run, as well
as the company’s economic, social and environmental policies, goals and performance with input from a
sustainability governance committee led by the vice president – environmental, health & safety. in this role, the
vice president – environmental, health & safety, along with the president and chief executive officer and the vice
president – human resources & community relations, review and approve doe run’s annual sustainability report.
the sustainability governance committee designates a team of employees to compile data and content for the
annual sustainability report.

doe run’s board expects management to keep pace with best practices in corporate governance. to accomplish
this goal, doe run utilizes a stringent set of corporate governance policies, procedures and practices to ensure that
the business is properly directed, administered and controlled. for example:

    as a privately held company, doe run is not legally bound to meet the requirements of the sarbanes-oxley
    act. this act was passed by congress in 2002 to help restore confidence in publicly traded companies after
    several major corporate and accounting scandals. however, doe run has chosen to adopt sarbanes-oxley
    requirements that can be applied to privately held companies. these include good documentation
    procedures, rigorous internal accounting controls based on a proper segregation of duties, and strong
    internal audits and reviews. we also undergo annual external audits by the accounting firm of crowe horwath
    llp, which adheres to generally accepted auditing standards (gaas as established by the american
    institute of certified public accountants. our decision to take these steps is consistent with our desire to
    conduct business ethically and responsibly. following this control framework also supports our efforts to
    maintain international organization for standardization (iso certifications at several operating sites. our
    herculaneum site, resource recycling facility and vancouver, washington, fabricated products inc. site are
    certified under iso 9000 programs, which verify that strong, quality procedures are in place. doe run’s
    sweetwater mine and mill, fletcher mine and mill, brushy creek mine and mill, and resource recycling
    facility also hold iso 14001 certification, which focuses on environmental management. specifics related to
    these certifications are included in our full gri report. doe run has written procedures and policies in place
    to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our financial records and the effectiveness of our internal control
    systems, particularly in such areas as accounting, purchasing, vendor receipts and customer transactions. in
    addition, the legal department reviews contracts for business risks and potential conflicts of interest.
    as a federal subcontractor, doe run adheres to the requirements of the office of federal contracts
    compliance program (ofccp). in doing so, doe run develops an annual affirmative action plan, which
    supports the principles of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action in all of its employment
    policies and practices, including recruiting, hiring, compensation, benefits, transfers, training, promotions,
    social recreation programs, company sponsored events, and in other terms and conditions of employment.

    doe run strives to maintain open communication with important audiences both inside and outside the
    company. as described within the reporting process, doe run regularly surveys stakeholders through third-
    party surveys of community stakeholders and employees (conducted in 2012 and 2014). through our
    corporate office, doe run provides our operating sites with guidance and education about community
    engagement. sites then implement programs based on the specific needs of local communities. these
    programs include regular community outreach, facility tours, public meetings and ongoing dialogue with local
    communities. you can share feedback with the company through any of these forums, or by
    contacting communityinfo@doerun.com.
    we also provide our employees with a mechanism by which they can anonymously share issues or concerns
    via a hotline system managed by an outside third party. once an employee makes a report, the third-party
    firm sends an email to the vice president – human resources & community relations and the vice president –
    law. timely investigations are conducted for all reports made to the hotline, with issues of safety given highest
    priority. any necessary communication between the reporter and the company is handled through the third-
    party firm to maintain confidentiality.

potential employees begin learning about the company’s expectations, values and sustainability policy from our
website and in hiring ads. in addition, the company’s standards of business conduct and company values, vision,
mission and business strategy are reviewed formally during the onboarding process. employees also are required
to sign an acknowledgment that they have received and understand the doe run employee handbook and
standards of business conduct.

our core values are reinforced daily in conversations, business processes, and internal and external
communications.

we believe we can enhance the quality of life through:

    safety: protecting one another.
    integrity: demonstrating transparency and honesty in all we say and do.
    collaboration: working together with employees and external stakeholders to realize shared goals.
    respect: recognizing that every employee has a voice and opinion that matters; diversity of experience,
    thought and ideas is encouraged.
    stewardship: conserving, managing and making the most of the natural resources in our care.
    sustainability: balancing social, environmental and economic considerations with a relentless focus on
    improving our processes.

to ensure that we stay current on corporate governance and corporate responsibility trends, we maintain
memberships in several industry-related trade associations. these associations support and educate members
about such issues as community engagement, environmental stewardship and sustainability. company leaders hold
committee and/or board positions in many of these organizations. doe run employs an award-winning project
management office (pmo) that utilizes a rigorous process to plan for, manage and evaluate projects. the pmo has
quantified improvements in areas such as project completion times and budget accuracy. by utilizing outside
resources and proven programs, we help ensure we are looking at, and implementing as appropriate, best
practices.

we believe that corporate governance is an evolving process. we are committed to continuous improvement in
setting sustainability targets and in our reporting so we can continue to operate responsibly and with integrity.

reporting process
   sustainability2015.doerun.com /governance/report-parameters/

based on the global reporting initiative (gri) definition of materiality, the doe run company (doe run)
determines what information to include in its sustainability report based on a variety of methods, including third-party
quantitative and qualitative research, one-on-one conversations, community meetings, tours and special events. we
include progress we have made on projects, processes, or challenges that have significant economic,
environmental and social impact (both positive and negative) on our company, our stakeholders and the industries
that depend on lead-based products.

doe run initially adopted the gri framework in 2009 as a response to research that indicated audiences wanted to
know more about the company, its efforts to operate safely and its investments to minimize its environmental impact.
a sustainability governance committee, established in 2012, is charged with implementing programs and
processes to further integrate sustainability into doe run’s operations, including the indicators and processes
reported in the sustainability report. the committee chair also approves the material topics, content and indicators
chosen for the reports.

several steps have helped doe run senior management and functional managers determine and improve
materiality for our sustainability reports.

    in 2012, doe run conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative research within the missouri communities
    in which it operates to improve how it communicates with stakeholders, including through this report. the
    research identified the major issues facing citizens in the community to be the local economy, job
    opportunities, environmental responsibility and community involvement.
    in 2014, doe run again conducted research within the missouri communities surrounding its operations to
    determine any changes to the major issues facing the communities, and inform the reporting aspects material
    to stakeholders outside our organization. the research indicated that the local economy, job opportunities
    and environmental responsibility continue to be top concerns to community stakeholders, as well as the
    safety of doe run operations and the company’s involvement in the community. in addition, the company has
    received non-solicited phone calls from across the u.s. from citizens expressing concerns about the closure
    of the last primary lead smelter in the u.s. and its potential impact on access to lead material for security and
    outdoor activities.
    in addition, the sustainability governance committee and doe run’s general managers identified the main
    challenges, accomplishments and progress within the company in 2015, including a reduction in workforce,
    progress on environmental projects, workforce safety and the global market’s impact on business decisions.
    doe run then prioritized which gri aspects and data indicators were material both inside and outside the
    organization to focus on in the 2015 report:

         environmental capital investment and performance, which relates to all operations
         workforce data for all operations
         direct and indirect economic impact
         community involvement
         employee health and safety at all operations

asarco inc.: a former lead mining and smelting company that operated in missouri, from which doe run
purchased some properties.

baghouse: a type of ventilation system used to control air emissions and reduce dust to improve environmental
performance.

behavior based safety (bbs): a system used internationally, often by manufacturing industries, that uses
demonstration, one-on-one observation and job feedback to recognize safe behaviors and explore behavioral
reasons for unsafe acts.

chat: a gravel-like waste product from the milling/mining process used before froth flotation was developed in the
1920s. chat contains minor amounts of lead, zinc and other metals.

concentrate: a term used to describe the product created after raw ore is milled, then physically separated from
waste rock (tailings).

electrocoagulation: a water treatment process that removes metal particles from water using electrical currents.

electrowinning: in a specialized tank, a current is passed from inert carbon-based anodes through a liquid
leaching solution, which contains dissolved metal. the electrical current causes the metal to be deposited onto
cathodes, where it is later harvested.

emissions(1): the gases and particles put into the air or emitted by various sources.

environmental protection agency (epa) (1): the national federal agency whose mission is to protect human
health and safeguard the natural environment.

flocculation: a water treatment process in which chemicals encourage metal particles to cluster together to settle
out of the water.

galena: lead sulfide, the most common type of lead ore.

international organization for standardization (iso): the world’s largest developer of international standards,
including standards for environmental management and product quality and safety.

job safety analysis (jsa) (2): a multi-step safety process that encourages employees to evaluate a job to identify
potential hazards and determine safe job procedures. employees document the information for coworkers and
future employees.

lead(3): a soft, malleable, dense metallic element that is extracted chiefly from galena. it is also found in ore with
zinc, silver and copper.

milling: the process that extracts much of the desirable mineral from ore through screening, crushing and grinding.

mine safety and health administration (msha) (4): the federal enforcement agency responsible for the health
and safety of miners.

missouri department of natural resources (mdnr): the missouri governing body that provides assistance,
education and guidance in the use and protection of missouri’s natural resources.

missouri businesses.

occupational safety and health administration (osha) (2): the federal agency charged with enforcing safety
and health legislation, specifically for the workplace.

ore: a naturally occurring mineral containing a valuable constituent (as metal) for which it is mined and worked.

parts per trillion (ppt): a measure of concentration used to easily compare environmental situations. one ppt is 1
part in 1,000,000,000,000.

primary lead: lead metal produced from extracted lead-bearing ore. primary lead is sometimes called virgin lead.

remediation: activities conducted to restore sites impacted by mining and mineral processing by removing the
materials and stabilizing the surface, or by encapsulation. also called reclamation.

secondary lead: lead produced from recycling lead-bearing material.

smelting(3): the process of reducing lead-bearing material into metallic lead in a furnace. the end result is refined
lead.

st. joe shovel: the world’s first electric shovel for mining, which was designed by engineers at st. joseph lead
company.

st. joseph lead company: a doe run predecessor company operating in southeast missouri.

tailings: ground-up, sand-sized rock that is the byproduct of milling and mining; often called the “tail end” of the
mining process.
