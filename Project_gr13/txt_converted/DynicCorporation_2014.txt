                                basic environmental policy


  [basic environmental policy of dynic]
       dynic corporation is aware the efforts toward environmental preservation are an important
   business challenge and believes it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to observe domestic and
   overseas laws and regulations related to the environment and provide products with less environ-
   mental burden to the markets. to implement the concept in a specific manner, we will thoroughly
   promote the following items in each of the stages, including development, material procurement,
   manufacturing, sales, distribution, and disposal.

   (1) we will reduce the environmental burden in all stages of our business activities throughout the life
       cycle of the products;
   (2) we will proactively make efforts to save energy and reduce waste, thereby preventing environ-
       mental contamination;
   (3) we will prevent risk caused by harmful chemical substances that damage the environment;
   (4) we will disclose information regarding our business activities related to the environment and
       proactively promote environment preservation activities, while acting in concert with local com-
       munities; and
   (5) we will implement education related to environmental preservation, thereby improving awareness
       of the environment.
                                                                               yoshio oishi, president
                                                                               dynic corporation


■efforts for reducing environmental burden
     we are introducing the manufacturing method that features less of an energy burden and implement-
ing product design where resource saving and longer service life are taken into consideration; in addition,
we consider materials that feature less of an environmental burden and materials that are easy to recycle
from the design phase of the product. in the manufacturing phase, we make efforts to save energy and
reduce waste in the manufacturing scene every day, thereby contributing to the reduction in the environ-
mental burden. in the marketing phase, we propose environmentally friendly products that reduce the
environmental burden at the customer by using the products, thereby making efforts to contribute to the
environmental preservation of the earth.

■efforts for countermeasures against global warming and biodiversity conservation
     we are promoting countermeasures against global warming through our efforts for energy-saving
activities throughout dynic, thereby reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. in addition, regarding the
biodiversity conservation, we are making efforts toward coexistence with the global environment through
our activities toward risks, including countermeasures against global warming.

●dbj environmental responsibility rating ranked up
     in october 2013, dynic corporation acquired an upgraded rating for the approach to environmental
consideration as advanced from the rating for 2012 in the environmental responsibility rating examination
of the financing system for the project to promote environmentally friendly management as executed by
the development bank of japan. the dbj environmental responsibility rating is a system where the
degree of environmental management of a company is evaluated through a screening system (rating
system) developed by dbj to select excellent companies, and the conditions for financing are set out
according to the scoring points.




    we received the environmental rating loan from the devel-
    opment bank of japan (dbj) in october 2013, and the
    result of rating was evaluated as advancing the approach to
    environmental consideration.




●photovoltaic power generation system
     we completed the photovoltaic power generation system by using the unused land of moka factory.
we have been utilizing photovoltaic power generation, which has attracted attention in recent years as
renewable energy. we adopted the system for the
purpose of the power selling business based on the
electric power purchase system instead of feeding the
power within the company. our efforts on the installation
of the environmentally friendly photovoltaic power
generation system are also attracting attention from the
local community.

●led illumination
      we have been replacing the ceiling lights of our
factories with led lights from mercury lights and we
are replacing the lights in the warehouses with led
lights. the led lights illuminate the warehouse
momentarily, thereby contributing to higher work
efficiency.




●sunlight illumination
      we introduced sunlight illumination for the show-
room in the shiga factory. the sunlight illumination is
a lighting system that takes in soft natural light by
letting in sunlight from the roof and diffusing the light.
the system also contributes to reductions in co2
because it does not use electric energy.




●zero waste campaign
     in shiga prefecture, cleaning is implemented
throughout the prefecture on the day before or after
may 30, which is stipulated as environmental cleanup
day (zero waste day). our shiga factory cooperates
with the cleanup activities in the local taga-cho area,
and we are implementing environmental cleanup
activities along route 306, which runs next to the
factory.

 measures for global warming/energy saving                                                                                                         2013

       in our production activities, we create products by consuming energy. as a result, we emit co2, a global warming gas. with
the goal of reduction in co2 emissions, we are making efforts to reduce the consumed energy in the production processes. we are
developing our activities under the goal of reducing the gas by 1% every year as compared with 2009. as investments in energy-
saving equipment, we have been implementing the replacement of ceiling lights (mercury lamps) of factories with led lamps,
change of transformers to the higher-efficiency type, change of air conditioners to the higher-efficiency type, change of compres-
sors to the centralized type, and the change of lights in office buildings to led lamps.
       the actual performance in 2013 revealed worsening in terms of specific energy consumption and co2 emissions, and we could
not achieve our goal. the reason is that the production of products that are highly affected by specific energy consumption
decreased, thereby resulting in deterioration of energy efficiency. in 2014, we will implement measures for improving energy efficiency
that corresponds to reduced production, and we will make further efforts toward achievement of the goal.

●effective utilization of water resources
     we are also working on the effective utilization of water resources throughout dynic. in the production
processes, we have been working on reductions in total water resources used and total drainage water quantity
by promoting recycling of cleaning water, cooling water, etc., used in the processes. in 2013, we succeeded in
reducing about 10% of the total water resources used and total drainage water compared to 2006.

        ●reduction in waste
             we are working on the reduction of waste to protect the global environment. for our activities, we have
        been promoting reuse and recycling not only for the purpose of reducing the total quantity of waste, but also from
        the viewpoint of the effective utilization of resources. regarding the total quantity of materials used, we could
        achieve a reduction of 4.4% from 37,129 tons in 2010 to 35,503 tons in 2013. although the total quantity of
        waste was slightly on the uptrend in 2009 and thereafter, the final disposal quantity of waste has been reduced
        year by year as a result of promoting reuse and recycling, thus resulting in a reduction of 35% compared to 2006.

  reduction in chemical substance release
     we have been reporting the quantity of release of chemical substances in use into the environment accord-
ing the prtr system based on the law concerning pollutant release and transfer register, and we are working
on a reduction thereof.
     the total emissions and the total quantity moved in 2013 increased from the achievements in 2012. the
reason is the effect of increases in the quantity of solvents used because the volume of printed products
increased. to reduce total emissions, we will introduce the incineration type of equipment in the future.
