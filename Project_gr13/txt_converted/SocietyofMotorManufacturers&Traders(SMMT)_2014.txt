 the report has 23 signatories which represent 95.9% of vehicle production in the uk. new signatories include bosch, ceva
 logistics, optare and schaeffler. however the report covers fewer sites from ford (southampton closed), toyota (salford
 technical site closed) and gm (millbrook sold).
 the 2012 and 2013 data have been adjusted to take into account new signatories and enable year-on-year comparison. the
 absolute values for 1999 are not directly comparable to the 2013 data as the number of signatories has changed over the years.
 *when the 1999 value is unknown, the first available figure is given. **sector turnover, r&d and jobs dependent on the sector are
 compiled from several official sources using expert smmt analysis. the 2012 and 2013 figures are based on projections.

upturn in the domestic market and on-going european market challenges saw a slight change in the
output mix, but four in five cars produced in the uk are still destined for export.


      nissan sunderland plant sets latest production milestone
      a second year of 500,000 production units meant nissan has built
      over one million cars in the last two years in the uk. its sunderland
      plant was the uk’s biggest car producer for a 16th consecutive year,
      with one in every three cars built in the uk last year coming out
      of sunderland.
      in 2013 the plant successfully launched the 100% electric leaf, the
      new nissan note and the second generation qashqai; the company's
      flagship model in europe and the highest volume car made in the uk.
      a ceremony in october marked the beginning of an extension to sunderland plant, for facilities to
      build premium vehicles under the infiniti brand.
      the year ended with a record employee headcount of over 7,000.

engine production in the uk also improved in 2013, rising back above 2.5 million units after a decline
in 2012. the closure of the ford transit plant in southampton was a key contributory factor to the
drop in cv production in 2013. if additional investment potential is realised then car production is set
to rise further and potentially exceed two million units by 2017. the increased vehicle output together
with the automotive council work on developing the uk supply chain is expected to support growth in
domestically sourced components.

                                          award-winning new vehicles in 2013. full year retail sales stood at
                                          425,006, up 19%, with strong growth in all major regions and new
                                          records set in 38 markets, including brazil, canada, korea and

                                          the china region up 30%, europe up 6%, north america up 21%, the
                                          uk up 14% and other overseas markets up 23%.


since 1999 there has been considerable restructuring in the automotive manufacturing sector, with the
closing of some sites offset by the success of others, notably jaguar land rover and mini
plant oxford’s thriving uk operations. access to the european marketplace remains key but exports
to markets further afield are on the increase, thanks to the uk’s developing reputation for globally
competitive premium products.

  automotive sector strategy drives uk business
  the automotive sector strategy, published in july 2013, provided a shared
  vision between industry and government for a globally competitive and
  growing uk automotive manufacturing industry. with automotive council
  leadership, the priorities set out are:
  • technology – including £1bn joint investment in the advanced propulsion
    centre (apc) to develop, commercialise and manufacture advanced
    propulsion technologies in the uk; technology roadmaps.
  • supply chain – including establishing an automotive investment
    organisation (aio) to improve the image of the uk as a place for
    automotive suppliers to invest; access to finance cooperation framework agreed with the banks.
  • skills – high level roadmap for skills to create talent pipeline.
  • business environment – establishment of new automotive council group to address and
    cement the uk as a globally competitive place to do automotive business.
  • kick-starting the ultra-low emission vehicle (ulev) market: £500m government investment
    2015-2020, building on £400m current investment; ulev strategy published in september 2013.
  the strategy is long-term. some actions are well advanced (eg apc, aio), for others workplans
  are still in their infancy. https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/using-industrial-strategy-to-

energy and resource efficiency
the sector’s dynamic nature is not only visible in its economic performance but also in its approach to
addressing all environmental impacts of the vehicles’ life cycle, starting from the production process,
through the use phase and finally their end-of-life.
the majority of co2 emissions is associated with the vehicle’s use phase, but progress is being made on
all fronts.
