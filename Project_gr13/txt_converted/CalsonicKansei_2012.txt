    with the aim of improving the global environment, calsonic kansei vigorously promotes
environmental management throughout the group worldwide, and encourages all group
employees to be more environmentally aware in the their daily operations.

1 calsonic kansei group environmental management promotion system
      to further promote global environmental management, in ﬁscal 2011 we held the global environment management
      meeting, replacing the former environment management meeting.
      under the global environment management meeting, there are four committees. each of the four committees
      develops an activity plan in its respective ﬁeld, which is then presented to the global environment management
      meeting. the meeting discusses and ﬁnalizes the group s action plan based on the plans submitted by the
      committees. the meeting also follows up the activities in the priority themes and ensures the eﬀective implementation

                                                the calsonic kansei group has introduced environmental accounting as a tool for quantitative
                                            evaluation of environmental activities and oﬃcial announcements.
                                                environmental accounting is a means of publicizing and quantitatively summing up the economic
                                            advantages accompanying environmental conservation measures, as well as the beneﬁts and costs of
                                            environmental conservation and related activities, and what we publicize in the environmental report
                                            fulﬁlls our commitment to explain our business activities to our various stakeholders.
                                            establishing a quantitative evaluation summary is helpful for enhancing our sustainable
                                            business management practices.
                                                those beneﬁts are summed up quantitatively, and announced to society in the form of
                                            environmental accounting through environmental reports. evaluation of quantitatively calculated
                                            results can also assist our environmental management practices.

                                             aqueous urea tank - urea scr system
                                             the nitrogen oxide (nox) present in exhaust gases is produced during combustion at high temperatures. by combining
                                             this nox with aqueous urea it can be broken down into harmless water and nitrogen. the urea scr system utilizes this
                                             mechanism to inject aqueous urea during catalysis, greatly reducing the amount of nox produced.
                                             the aqueous urea tank is an important component that supports the urea scr system.
                                             as the tank is made from stainless steel, it has excellent rustproof properties and, along with the egr cooler, intercooler
                                             and the aluminum fuel tank, this environmentally friendly product has been developed to meet the various needs of our
                                             customers.
                                             this is the ﬁrst time anywhere in the world that an aqueous urea tank has been mass-produced for vehicle installation. it
                                             is also highly durable and corrosion resistant.

                                        6 noise prevention - reducing exhaust noise in exhaust parts

                                              by analyzing the silencing elements using elemental
                                              technology, and then combining the various elements, we
                                              are developing exhaust parts with high levels of silencing
                                              performance.




                                        7 lca eﬀorts (product environmental impact evaluation)
                                              we believe that by quantitatively evaluating and understanding the environmental impact of products, we will be able
                                              to implement suitable environmental measures by assessing the appropriateness of product plans, determining whether
                                              developmental plans are required or not, and setting priorities for environment-conscious matters during the product
                                              design, development and manufacturing processes.
                                              we have already calculated the internal environmental burden per unit for each of the products we make at our
                                              manufacturing plants, and we have entered this information into databases as lca data for self-manufactured products.
                                              lca data are also calculated for selected target vehicle types.
                                              in 2006, we started the product environmental indicator wg to assess methods for evaluating the environmental
                                              aspect of products during the product development process by reviewing the usage of lca indicators, for example, and
                                              utilizing the results. in 2007, we built a co2 emissions-computing system to calculate the co2 emission amounts
                                              generated during the manufacturing process for each of our products.

    7 eﬀorts to manage chemical substances
     substances that could impact the environment are used in some products, and for the manufacture of
 items designed to improve the quality of these products. therefore, there are concerns that these substances
 could have a signiﬁcant impact on the environment during the manufacture and use of these products and
 also when they are discarded.
     global awareness of the environment is now increasing and more requests to reduce/stop using these
 substances are coming in every year, both from home and abroad.
     in response, we are promoting the responsible management of chemical substances (environmentally
 hazardous substances) by adhering to the laws and regulations of each country and by responding promptly
 to our customers requests.


 1 basic concepts
     to achieve responsible risk management for products , manufacturing process , purchased materials and processed
     materials , we adhere to the following fundamental principles: use as few harmful chemicals as possible , eliminate as
     many harmful substances as possible and change to alternatives and properly manage harmful chemicals if they have
     to be used.

     the calsonic kansei group is quantitatively evaluating the environmental burden output resulting from
its industrial operations, and striving to reduce this burden by gaining a comprehensive understanding of the
impact of all operations.
     from the viewpoint of global warming, we promote reduced carbon emissions and reduced emissions per
unit and, from the viewpoint of the eﬀective use of resources, we promote 100% reuse of those resources -
creating zero waste so that our factories can operate in balance with the environment.
     furthermore, our concerted eﬀorts and achievements regarding the electric power usage restriction
ordinance adopted in the summer of 2011, which set various restraints in place, greatly surpassed the
original targets and promoted our energy management goals.

    in fy 2011, we established the calsonic kansei green program 2016 midterm environmental plan and we are
    now promoting various activities to reach the fy 2016 goal.

                                               ①response to the restriction of electricity use in the summer of 2011
                                               the calsonic kansei group has sought to respond to the japanese government s request for an overall reduction in electricity use of 15%. we
                                               have distributed engine compressors to each plant so that they can be operated in accordance with actual electricity use. we have also
                                               introduced smart meters which allow the amount of electricity used in all group companies and in each business establishment to be monitored
                                               at the headquarters, and power interchange between group companies to be managed. as a result, electricity use was reduced by 28% in the
                                               tokyo electric power company service area and by 25% in the tohoku electric power company service area.
