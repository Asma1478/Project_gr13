     ales mushiyoke clean® repels insect pests

     background and issue addressed
     infectious disease prevention is
     an important social challenge
     it is unpleasant and annoying when spiders, winged ants, moths, or other
     insects alight on walls. kansai paint has developed ales mushiyoke clean®,
     a coating that repels insect pests when coated on room walls. this product is
     expected to be effective in preventing infectious diseases.


     a problem-solving initiative
     kansai paint has blended into a coating a pharmacological agent that repels
     midges, termites, and other insects. this ingredient affects the nervous
     systems of insects that alight on coated room surfaces, making it difficult
     for them to remain in the room!


          many insect pest species, after entering a room, tend to
          spend more time on walls or the ceiling than flying.
                                                                                                    here’s why it’s effective!

                                                  rest than flying.


          blending an insect repellent (a pyrethroid agent) into the coating wards off insects by     contact with the
          affecting the nervous systems (causing discomfort) of insects that alight on (come into     insect repellent
          contact with) coated room surfaces.

management of chemical substances
many countries are adopting chemical product regulations to
achieve the world summit on sustainable development
(wssd) goals, including the regulation on registration,
evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals
(“reach”) in europe. in asia, in particular, the institution of
laws and regulations governing chemicals is proceeding
rapidly. kansai paint operates in europe, north america,
china, taiwan, south korea, southeast asia, india, and africa.
we are striving to gather information on regulations in these
countries and regions through industry organizations,
consulting firms, and other sources.
    in addition, we have already complied with globally
harmonized system of classification and labelling of
chemicals (ghs) labeling on safety data sheets (sds) in
countries where ghs has been introduced. we will also
proceed with ghs compliance in thailand, indonesia, and
other countries when they introduce ghs in the future.

     3. financial instruments
     1. status of financial instruments
     (1) policies on financial instruments
     	the companies procure funds necessary for capital investment and raise short-term working capital mainly through bank loans
         and the issuance of bonds. the companies manage temporary surplus funds through financial assets that have a high level of
         safety. the companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk and do not
         enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes.

     (2) details of financial instruments and associated risks
     	trade notes and accounts receivable are exposed to customer credit risk. in addition, receivables denominated in foreign currencies
         from overseas operations are exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. investment securities are primarily the stocks of
         business partners and customers and are exposed to market price fluctuation risk.
     		 most trade notes and accounts payable are due for payment within one year. those denominated in foreign currencies are
         exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. the companies use forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk of
         exchange rate fluctuations associated with receivables, payables and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies
         within the actual demand. refer to “significant hedge accounting methods” in note 2, “summary of significant accounting
         policies,” for a description of the company’s accounting policies related to hedging activities.

     (3) risk management framework for financial instruments
         1) credit risk management (counterparty risk)
     		the company has established internal rules and procedures for receivables under which the business planning & administration
            division and finance and accounting department are primarily responsible for monitoring counterparty status. the departments
            manage amounts and settlement dates by counterparty and work to quickly identify and mitigate payment risk that may result
            from situations such as the deterioration of the financial condition of a counterparty. consolidated subsidiaries of the company
            are subject to the same risk management rules. in using derivative transactions, the company mitigates counterparty risk by
            conducting transactions with financial institutions with high credit ratings.

  2)	market risk management (risk of exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations)
		for some receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, the companies use forward foreign exchange contracts
      to hedge the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on a monthly and currency-by-currency basis.
			 for securities and investment securities, the companies periodically examine the fair value of the instruments and the
      financial condition of the issuing entities. in addition, the companies regularly evaluate whether securities other than those
      classified as held-to-maturity should be maintained taking into account their fair values and relationship with the issuing
      entities.
			 for derivative transactions, the finance & accounting department handles the transactions after receiving approval from
      those with final approval authority in accordance with the company’s internal rules. administrative reports on the results are
      periodically provided to the management committee.
  3) management of liquidity risk associated with capital procurement (payment default risk)
		in the companies, the financial & accounting department is responsible for maintaining adequate liquidity and manages
      liquidity risk by creating and updating a capital deployment plan based on reports from each division.

(4) supplementary explanations about matters concerning fair value of financial instruments
	the fair value of financial instruments is based on their market price and, in cases in which market price is not available, a
    reasonably calculated price. such prices are calculated using certain assumptions and may differ if the assumptions change.

     (4) write-down of securities
         in the year ended march 31, 2016, write-down was not recognized on securities.
     		 in the year ended march 31, 2015, write-down of ¥563 million was recognized on available-for-sale securities, consisting of
         listed equity securities in the amount of ¥563 million.
     		 write-down is recognized if the fair value has fallen to less than 50% of the acquisition cost. if the fair value is less than the
         acquisition cost by an amount between 30% and 50% of the acquisition cost, write-down is recognized as deemed necessary
         considering the recoverability of the value. write-down of securities which do not have readily determinable fair value is basically
         recognized if the financial condition is deteriorating and the value is less than 50% of the acquisition cost unless the value is
         considered to be recoverable on an individual basis.

9. net assets
under japanese laws and regulations, the entire amount paid for new shares is required to be designated as common stock.
however, a company may, by a resolution of the board of directors, designate an amount not exceeding one half of the price of the
new shares as additional paid-in capital, which is included in capital surplus.
    under the japanese corporate law, in cases in which a dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to
10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of common stock over the total of additional paid-in capital and legal earnings
reserve must be set aside as additional paid-in capital or legal earnings reserve. legal earnings reserve is included in retained earnings
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
    legal earnings reserve and additional paid-in capital may be used to eliminate or reduce a deficit by a resolution of the
shareholders’ meeting. all additional paid-in capital and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and
retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends.
    the maximum amount that the company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the non-consolidated financial
statements of the company in accordance with japanese laws and regulations.
    at the annual shareholders’ meeting held on june 29, 2016, the shareholders approved cash dividends of ¥9.5 ($0.08) per share
amounting to ¥2,539 million ($22,533 thousand). this appropriation was not accounted for in the consolidated financial statements
at march 31, 2016. such appropriations are recognized in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders.

    revision of the local tax act, etc.” (act no. 13 of 2016) by the diet on march 29, 2016, corporate tax rates have been reduced
    from the fiscal years beginning on or after april 1, 2016. accordingly, the effective statutory income tax rate used to measure
    deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities has been revised from 32.3% to 30.8% for temporary differences expected to be
    resolved from the fiscal year beginning on april 1, 2016 and on april 1, 2017, and to 30.6% for those expected to be resolved
    from the fiscal year beginning on or after april 1, 2018. as a result of these changes, deferred tax liabilities (net amount after
    deduction of deferred tax assets) decreased by ¥689 million ($6,115 thousand), income taxes-deferred increased by ¥9 million
    ($80 thousand), net unrealized holding gains on securities increased by ¥577 million ($5,121 thousand) and remeasurements of

         information is available and reviewed regularly by the board of directors in determining how to allocate management resources
         and evaluate operating performance. the company and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are primarily engaged in the
         manufacturing and sale of paints and coatings. the company is mainly in charge of business activities in japan while locally
         incorporated overseas subsidiaries are in charge in each region. locally incorporated overseas subsidiaries are independent
         business units that develop their own business activities and establish their own comprehensive strategies in each region.

         following four reportable segments: japan, india, asia and africa.
