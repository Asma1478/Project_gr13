osmanabad district is one of the worst drought affected
regions in maharashtra. as a long term solution to the drought
situation in the village, kpit, in association with rashtriya
sarvanghin gram vikas sanstha, embarked upon an ambitious
project of building a cnb in the year 2016. about 20m x2.6m
x2.6m cnb was constructed in the village, enabling a water
corridor of 22m x 600m x 2m. this will result in a storage of 16
