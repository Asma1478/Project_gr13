market climate


expected growth rates for private wealth continue to create an attractive
market environment for private banking. particularly promising is the
outlook for new markets in asia, eastern europe, africa and south
america.



                                              the past year was dominated by political outcomes that reduced
                                              uncertainty. parliamentary elections in greece and france addressed
                                              the survival of the euro and the financial stability of europe. the
                                              divisions over america’s future economic direction exacerbated
                                              during the presidential campaign eased somewhat after the
                                              election, with a consequent rally on financial markets early in
                                              2013. central banks had to take even stronger engagement
                                              actions to continue the economic recovery momentum. the
                                              us federal reserve made clear its commitment to finance the
                                              us economy for as long as necessary with an ongoing liquidity
                                              program, while the european central bank declared that it would
                                              be ready to buy unlimited amounts of bonds of euro countries if
                                              necessary.



                                              positive outlook for stock markets in 2013,
                                              following a strong 2012

committed to thinking and acting in a sustainable manner in all aspects
of its business.

                             stability as a swiss private bank. sustainability enables it to
                             project a distinctive image on the market and creates continuity
                             across time and generations.



                             a commitment for the future

                             that, in the best interests of its clients and partners, minimises
                             risks as much as possible. farsighted strategic and operational
                             decisions that anticipate the market and regulatory environment
                             at an early stage make a contribution to this. thus, the bank is
                             able to safeguard the future orientation and its leading position.

                             the sustainability strategy is strictly implemented at management
                             and operational levels, which ensures credibility.

                       careful use of drinking water
                       in terms to environmental relevance, the
                       water consumption of a financial services
                       company is relatively insignificant compared
                       to other consumption figures. for reporting
                       purposes, the quantity of waste or reused
                       water is therefore not measured. as a
                       financial services provider, sarasin does not
                       generally discharge toxic substances into
                       the water. nevertheless, clean drinking water
                       is becoming increasingly scarce worldwide,
                       which makes it essential to use it carefully.
                       aerators have been installed on all taps in
                       the bank’s head office buildings. in addition,
                       wc flushing systems were adapted to cut
                       water consumption per flush. in geneva,
                       consumption was reduced by about 50%
                       thanks to a new cooling system. throughout

    the changes in water consumption are also due to an adaption of the survey methodology
    and data quality improvement.

                                             j. safra sarasin holding ltd. accepts no responsibility for the infor-
                                             mation provided on the third-party internet sites mentioned in this
                                             publication and does not endorse their content.

                                             precautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements
                                             this report contains forward-looking statements. these statements
                                             may include specific assumptions about the j. safra sarasin group’s
                                             future business performance and development of income as well as
                                             general assumptions underlying such statements.
                                             by their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent
                                             risks and uncertainties, both general and specific. there is therefore
                                             a risk that predictions, forecasts and other expectations described or
                                             implied in the forward-looking statements will not be achieved.
                                             a number of factors can lead to actual outcomes and developments
                                             that are materially different from those described in the forward-
                                             looking statements. these factors include the economic situation,
                                             the state of the financial markets worldwide and possible loan losses
                                             or potential defaults of trading counterparties.
                                             j. safra sarasin holding ltd. does not assume any responsibility for
                                             updating such forward-looking statements and adapt them to new
                                             information or future events.
