                  we aspire to be the leading client-centric global
                  universal bank.

                  deutsche bank’s businesses encompass a wide range of
                  products and services in investment banking, private
                  and commercial banking, transaction banking as well as
                  in asset and wealth management.

                  the group operates in all regions of the world. deutsche bank
                  is the leader in its german home market and enjoys an
                  outstanding position in europe. the bank also has a strong
                  competitive position in north america as well as in key
                  emerging markets, particularly in asia.

                  with strategy 2015+, deutsche bank is reinforcing its
                  commitment to the universal banking model, to its home
                  market of germany and to its global positioning.

                  the strategy emphasizes the need for organic growth
                  of its capital base, the further reduction in risk and higher
                  operating performance. deutsche bank aims to be at the
                  forefront of cultural change in the financial services sector.

strategy
2015+
strategy 2015+ reflects deutsche bank’s dedication to high performance and responsibility.
we are driving profound cultural change and reinforcing our commitment to the universal
banking model, to our home market of germany and to our global positioning. five levers
are key to delivering strategy 2015+.




1                 // clients
                  our clients are at the center of everything we do. only through providing sustainable benefits for them
                  can we create sustainable value for our shareholders. we place emphasis on our home market, ­germany,
                  the asia pacific region and the americas.




2                 // competencies
                  our business is built on the best people, best processes and consistent improvement. we will provide high-­
                  quality advice and first-class service with absolute integrity and teamwork, including closer collaboration
                  across our corporate divisions and central functions.




3                 // capital
                  we are committed to further strengthening our capital ratios through organic capital growth and by
                  ­reducing risk-weighted assets in order to establish a strong capital base and rigorous risk-adjusted capital
                   allocation. thereby we contribute to making the financial system more stable and secure.




4                 // costs
                  we are implementing disciplined cost management and promote consistent productivity gains through
                  building outstanding infrastructure functions and eliminating duplication and organizational complexity.




5                 // culture
                  we aim to be at the forefront of cultural change in our industry. we recognize the need for profound cultural
                  change that places client relationships and integrity at the heart of all our initiatives. incentivizing sustainable
                  performance helps us to create a culture that reflects societal values and benefits all stakeholders.

                  co-chairmen of the management board




                                      ladies and gentlemen,
                                      eighteen months ago, we launched deutsche bank’s strategy 2015+.
                                      our strategy defines a clear path toward our aspiration: to be the leading
                                      client-centric global universal bank. as one of the key elements of
                                      this strategy, we committed ourselves to placing deutsche bank at
                                      the ­forefront of cultural change in our industry. restoring the bond
                                      of trust with society is a top priority – for the banking industry and for
                                      deutsche bank.

                                      we are under no illusions. we recognize that deep cultural change is a
                                      process of years, not months. during 2013, we laid important foundations
                                      for sustainable, long-term change. we defined a new set of values and
                                      beliefs, which define the type of institution deutsche bank aspires to be.
                                       we developed these after seeking the views of some 52,000 of our
                                      staff, and launched them in our organization in july with the help of
                                      the bank’s top-250 leaders. together with our colleagues in the group
                                      ­executive committee, we personally presented and discussed the new
                                       values and beliefs with more than 11,000 of our people.

corporate responsibility 2013   ﻿




                                our priority now is to embed these values and beliefs in everyday
                                ­behaviors. to achieve this, we have changed the way we measure and
                                manage performance. for example: adherence to our values and b  ­ eliefs
                                now plays a significant role in determining the pay and prospects of
                                 deutsche bank staff.

                                the path to cultural change also involves reinforcing our internal controls.
                                during 2013, we significantly strengthened our legal and compliance
                                capabilities and enhanced our risk management mechanisms. in addition,
                                we are further reinforcing our control model across businesses, control
                                functions and group audit – our “three lines of defense” against potential
                                problems. as we strengthen deutsche bank for the future, we are also
                                decisively dealing with litigation matters arising from the past. in 2013,
                                we settled some of the most significant cases relating to legacy issues
                                and successfully defended the bank in others.

                                as part of our commitment to a strong risk culture, we developed and
                                ­refined the ways in which we assess environmental and social risks.
                                  we seek to provide products and services that create value for society
                                 and respond to global challenges such as climate change. in 2013,
                                 we established new mechanisms for investing according to clear
                                 ­environmental, social and governance criteria. we introduced new
                                  ways of ­assessing the balance between clients’ and shareholders’
                                  needs. we were also one of the leading financiers of renewable energy
                                  projects. we know that this is an area of much debate, covering different
                                  opinions, ­attitudes and interests. we seek to play an active role in that
                                  debate by engaging in lively and wide-ranging dialogue with stake­holders
                                  who have different perspectives. these commitments are also reflected
                                  in our continued support of the un global compact.

                                once again, deutsche bank and its foundations were active corporate
                                citizens during 2013. some 19,500 employees devoted their time and
                                ­energy to many worthwhile causes and organizations. to recognize their
                                 efforts, we have rolled out our volunteer award on a global basis.

creating value
for all stakeholders
corporate responsibility                     for deutsche bank, conducting business responsibly means serving the interests and
balancing the dimensions of sustainability   meeting the needs of all our stakeholders. our products and services, which form
                                             the basis of our financial return, must address the global economic, social and
                                             ­environmental challenges that are shaping the 21st century. we recognize both the
                                              risks and opportunities associated with developments such as demographic change,
                economics
                                              the rise of emerging economies and the pressing issues of environmental protection

                                              we also contribute to tackling pressing social challenges through our commitment

                                             the values and beliefs we introduced in 2013 underpin our approach to corporate
                                             responsibility. they define how we will operate our business while focusing on
                                             ­sustainable performance, client centricity, discipline, partnership, innovation, and
                                              – above all – integrity. we will create long-term value for all stakeholders, including
                                              our clients, shareholders, employees and society at large as well as the environment,
                                              by doing what is right, rather than merely what is legally allowed. succeeding in this
                                              will enable us to win back trust.

                                             creating value for all our stakeholders, however, is often a delicate balancing act,
                                             as the interests and priorities of various groups are not always identical. our products
                                             and services must primarily meet clients’ financial needs and objectives and also
                                             ­provide adequate financial return for the bank. at the same time, they should create
                                              benefits rather than risks for society or the environment. at times, it is difficult to
                                             fulfill these criteria all at once. still, we consistently strive to increase the importance
                                             of non-financial factors in our core business.

                                             the overall benefit of our business is clear: it facilitates capital flows and fuels
                                             ­economic development. this, in turn, supports reaching global goals, such as
                                              increased resource productivity and greater use of clean technologies. it is our
                                              responsibility to further strengthen these benefits while also taking into consideration
                                              and curbing the possible negative consequences of our business. we have pursued
                                              this approach through a variety of activities in 2013.

    // reinforcing
    responsible behavior
    a strong control framework must be accompanied
    by a culture that encourages employees to do the
    right thing, although it may not be mandated by rules,
    ­regulations or legislation. we have strengthened our
     ­compliance ­program and are further building a strong
      risk-focused culture, for example through expanding
      our red flags initiative.


    it has become increasingly important for banks to
    understand and respond to the potential environmental
    and social risks associated with business activities.
    we analyze these risks carefully and are optimizing
    the risk framework we implemented to minimize harm to
    people and the environment as well as the reputations
    of the bank and our clients.

                                drawing on the recent experiences in the banking sector, we seek to strengthen our
                                control framework and to continually drive cultural change across the bank. targeted
                                risk culture initiatives bring our values and beliefs to life and drive a culture in which
                                everyone takes responsibility for their actions.

                                 managing non-financial risks, including reputational risks, is intrinsic to our control
                                 framework, supplementing more traditional risk management such as credit and
                                 market risks. as global challenges evolve, we also increasingly analyze and mitigate
                                ­environmental and social (es) risks that may arise in our business. page 25

                                employees are our first line of defense against unethical or inappropriate business
                                practices. we require all employees to act according to the highest standards of
                                ­integrity in everything we say and do. compliance with all applicable laws and
                                 ­regulations is a minimum requirement, but we expect our people to go beyond
                                  ­simply what is allowed and do what is right.



                                guiding interactions with stakeholders
                                all employees are expected to act honestly, responsibly and with integrity, abiding by

corporate responsibility 2013   control framework




                                deutsche bank is dedicated to complying with all applicable anti-fraud, anti-bribery
                                and anti-corruption laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. we do
                                not tolerate fraud, bribery or any form of corruption, and we do not provide or accept
                                improper inducements in the course of our business dealings. all of our employees
                                as well as third parties that act on deutsche bank’s behalf are strictly prohibited from
                                having any involvement in acts of fraud, bribery or corruption. if we cannot obtain or
                                retain business without improper conduct, then we do not engage in that business.

                                the anti-fraud, anti-bribery and anti-corruption program is strengthening policies,
                                procedures and controls to address operational business risks. as part of this initiative,
                                we have ­commissioned an assessment of global fraud, bribery and corruption risk in
                                all ­divisions. approximately 180 risk assessment workshops have taken place across
                                all our major hubs, and the outputs will enhance our fraud, bribery and corruption risk
                                management framework.

                                adherence to anti-money laundering regulations is absolutely fundamental to all
                                deutsche bank entities regardless of geographic location. each entity is required to
                                adhere to minimum standards based on the german banking act, the german anti-
                                money laundering act and the current guidelines of the german federal financial
                                supervisory authority as well as further guiding principles on anti-money laundering.

                                to familiarize staff with the relevant laws and regulations, as well as our policies and
                                procedures to detect money laundering, we conduct training courses, including those
                                stipulated by the german anti-money laundering act. all new employees receive this
                                training and take refresher courses at least every two years.

                                effective action against money laundering relies on adequate and up-to-date
                                ­information on client relationships. know-your-customer (kyc) is an ongoing process,
                                 from the adoption of the client throughout the life of the relationship. deutsche bank’s
                                 kyc policies cover new client adoption as well as regular reviews and screening of
                                existing client relationships against internal and external lists of negative information.
                                these policies provide a framework for governance, management oversight, risk
                                assessment and escalation of potential risks to senior management.

                                as part of a group-wide kyc program, we performed a detailed assessment of existing
                                kyc standards across business divisions and infrastructure functions in 2013 to identify
                                effective measures to further strengthen the bank’s defenses. we have begun an
                                ­in-­depth review of the adherence of operations in 48 countries to deutsche bank
                                 ­principles. we will also establish a kyc center of excellence as a dedicated unit within
                                the anti-money laundering organization. this will bring together relevant subject-
                                  matter expertise and will provide central oversight and advice, including guidance on

                                building a strong risk culture
                                our risk culture initiatives program reinforces the importance of employee
                                behaviors for the bank’s long-term success. this program emphasizes five behaviors
                                that ­employees need to demonstrate:

                                — being fully responsible for the bank’s risks
                                — being rigorous, forward-looking and comprehensive in assessing risk
                                — inviting, providing and respecting challenge
                                — trouble-shooting collectively
                                — placing deutsche bank and its reputation at the heart of all decisions

                                the importance of adhering to these behaviors is communicated through a variety of
                                channels across all levels of the organization.

                                the program also identifies and supports the implementation of mandatory risk
                                ­culture training for all employees. in 2013, 82,028 employees enrolled in at least one
                                 risk culture course, covering topics such as fraud awareness, risk awareness and

                                using “red flags” to monitor risk-related behavior
                                the risk culture program’s red flags initiative uses objective measures to assess
                                employees’ adherence to risk-related policies and processes. it allows senior managers
                                to address risks more effectively and creates a stronger link between behavior
                                and reward.

                                employees in breach of an applicable policy or process receive a red flag. all red
                                flags are risk-weighted depending on the severity and frequency of the incident.
                                aggregated red flag scores are taken into account in reviews of performance, pay
                                and promotion.

corporate responsibility 2013   control framework




                                since its inception, the red flags process has been rolled out to corporate banking and
                                securities, global transaction banking, deutsche asset and wealth management, risk
                                and the non-core operations unit. further roll-outs are planned throughout 2014.

                                some red flag categories, such as overdue mandatory training and unauthorized
                                employee trading, are relevant to all divisions and functions. other categories, such as
                                unauthorized crossings of “chinese walls” or credit limits are specific to each division’s
                                risk profile. red flag categories are reviewed on a regular basis – new indicators may
                                be added, old ones retired or existing ones amended as appropriate.

                                the system is designed to promote compliance, and where possible we help ­employees
                                to avoid red flags. for example, employees receive automated e-mail reminders
                                when they are enrolled in mandatory training or when they need to take mandatory
                                time away. supervisors are also able to access information on risks and policy breaches
                                in their business areas.

                                since introducing red flags, the number of breaches has decreased steadily, indicating
                                a positive change in risk-related behaviors.

                                ensuring new products are appropriate
                                we are committed to providing only products and services that create value for clients
                                and shareholders through meeting the clients’ needs. our new product approval
                                (npa) processes provide the scrutiny necessary to achieve these aims and to ensure
                                that we can confidently offer clients our products and services.

                                npa processes apply to all new product offerings, including variations to existing
                                 products. all product developments must be approved by key control functions,
                                 including compliance and aml. npa committees at the regional and divisional levels
                                 must approve developments considered “material,” including new risk factors or
                                ­businesses. in addition, any features causing concern, such as potential reputational
                                 impact on the bank, are escalated to the relevant management approval committees,
                                such as the regional or group reputational risk committees.

                                web-based training is provided to ensure that all employees understand the npa
                                ­ rocesses and is required for all relevant staff members. failure to comply with these

                                                       managing reputational risk
                                                       operating responsibly while serving diverse stakeholder interests also means weighing
                                                       the risks against the value created. our business model is built on public trust, so it is
                                                       essential that in addition to standard risk inherent to our business, we avoid risks that
                                                       can undermine trust.

                                                       effective risk management fundamentally stems from employees internalizing their
                                                       responsibility for the bank’s success and its reputation. we provide guidance and
                                                       ­procedures to help employees meet this responsibility, such as the reputational risk
                                                        management program policy (rrmpp).

                                                       the rrmpp lays out consistent standards for dealing with reputational risk issues
                                                       that may arise from transactions with our clients. it requires reputational risks
                                                       to be ­adequately identified, addressed, and escalated to a more senior level when
                                                       necessary.

                                                       as part of the rrmpp, a reputational risk analysis guide provides specific questions
                                                       for business managers to consider regarding the client profile, the nature and terms
                                                       of the transaction and any potential reputational impact.

                                the guide includes questions such as:

                                —	is there any negative market intelligence relating to this client, the client’s
                                   ­management team or principals?
                                —	could the transaction be viewed as having no valid business purpose or
                                    economic substance?
                                —	could the transaction be viewed by some as promoting activities considered
                                    ­contrary to the “public good”?
                                —	are there any non-standard terms, or terms inconsistent with market norms?
                                —	does the transaction raise any actual or potential conflicts of interest?
                                —	does this transaction pose any significant environmental, health or safety risks?

                                if our business managers identify any reputational risk, a further evaluation is required
                                with more senior-level input.

                                ­ uidelines for specific sensitive topics or industries (such as defense equipment,
                                porno­graphy, betting and gambling) support this evaluation. the bank’s control groups
                                (e.g. compliance, aml & financial crime, group sustainability, legal) are available
                                for consultation and have a say on whether it is reasonable for the bank to pursue
                                the business.

                                doing the right thing leaves room for discretion and may result in a variety of views.
                                thus, a case can ultimately be escalated to the group reputational risk committee
                                (grrc). the grrc is a subcommittee of the bank’s risk executive committee and is
                                co-chaired by two members of the management board. page 32

                                one of our teams in the emea (europe, middle-east and africa) region had the
                                 ­opportunity to purchase an interesting portfolio of non-performing real-estate loans
                                 (npl) in a country that suffered from the real-estate crisis. the banking sector was
                                heavily criticized by the public for ­mismanagement during the crisis. the transaction
                                itself would have provided a meaningful revenue opportunity for deutsche bank,
                                was well structured and would have increased the bank’s market share in that region
                                ­significantly. the npl transaction was reviewed, however, due to strong ­concerns
                                regarding public perception and regional reputation, the transaction was not approved.

                                  our clients and peers in the financial sector helps us
                                  to improve our understanding of key issues and to define
                                  ­appropriate standards.


                                strengthening internal frameworks
                                taking risks is part of our business model. as we lay out in our values, we are committed
                                to doing what is right, not only what is legally allowed. thus, we must consider risks
                                that go beyond the traditional financial risks intrinsic to our business, such as credit
                                and market risk. we evaluate potential environmental and social (es) risks that could
                                arise from transactions or interactions with our clients.

                                when assessing es risks in certain cases, the answers are clear-cut. for example,

  db.com/cr/cluster-munitions   or key components thereof. most es risk issues, however, are more complex.

                                as a global bank, we serve all sectors of the economy. it is therefore not always
                                ­feasible to eliminate all es risks from our business. we avoid business, however, that
                                 could have negative impacts on ecosystems and society. if impacts are unavoidable,
                                 they should be mitigated as much as possible through implementing the appropriate
                                 improvement measures.

                                we have several mechanisms in place to thoroughly consider the possible es risks
                                arising from transactions or client relationships. based on these evaluations, we
                                determine the best course of action.

                                implementing guidance for es risks
                                 to support our business units in assessing the es risks that result from client
                                 ­relationships or transactions, we have implemented the environmental and social
                                  ­reputational risk framework (es risk framework) and continually supplement
                                 it with a set of ­environmental and social impact assessment guidelines for critical
                                 sectors. these guidelines help business units to identify whether a transaction
                                 is likely to trigger es risks that are either entirely unacceptable or require specific
                                ­mitigating action. we also developed a training concept to build awareness regarding
                                 es risks in our core business and to further detail the appropriate evaluation processes.
                                   the trainings will be rolled out in 2014.

                                beyond these tools, business units are encouraged to consult our sustainability team
                                for advice on complex issues. the team is prepared to review relevant transactions
                                and clients to ensure compliance with our es risk framework and alignment with our
                                broader sustainability commitments and goals. accordingly, the team offers guidance
                                on whether a client relationship or transaction is justifiable from an environmental and
                                social perspective.

                                in 2013, the number of transactions reviewed by the team under the es risk framework
                                increased by a further 78% as compared to 2012, reflecting the increased awareness of
                                these risks within the business units. page 32

                                identifying risk-prone sectors
                                through our es risk framework, we define critical sectors that are especially connected
                                with potential es risks. when transactions or clients relate to these sectors, internal
                                sustainability experts must be consulted throughout the corresponding due diligence
                                and approval processes. we currently see the following sectors as critical:

                                —	pulp, paper and forestry
                                —	chemical industry
                                —	aerospace and defense
                                —	infrastructure
                                —	metals (e.g. steel) and mining (e.g. copper, coal)
                                —	oil and gas
                                —	utilities
                                —	other activities with high carbon intensity

                                we continually scan global developments across markets, regions and industries in
                                order to detect arising environmental or social pressure points. we research issues
                                we consider to present potentially significant es risks as a basis for developing specific
                                guidance for transactions.

                                in 2013, we analyzed the controversially discussed “fracking” technology for
                                extracting shale gas. this led to an enhanced due diligence requirement for any
                                potential transactions in this sector.

                                   in developing our position on certain environmental and social topics, we refer to
                                   ­recognized standards, principles or guidelines such as the world bank/ifc
                                    ­performance standards and the un guiding principles on business and human
                                   rights. we also review existing sectoral standards and industry best practices to help
                                   with our decision­making on topics such as nuclear power, palm oil or shale gas.
                                     as sustainability is a rapidly evolving field, standards may not always be available
                                     or adequate to deal with pressing issues such as climate change, in which case we
                                     also consult internal and external experts. page 33

                                our understanding and management of es risks is also greatly informed through our

                                institutions, our clients and peers in the financial sector.

                                conducting wide-ranging dialogue allows us to work with these groups to define or
                                improve standards and voluntary commitments and to discuss ways to apply them

                                a result of such dialogue, we can work constructively and communicate openly with our
                                critics, articulating our position on key issues and explaining the limitations inherent
                                to banking products and services.



                                palm oil
                                 in 2013, an important international ngo contacted deutsche bank regarding a large
                                 asian company active in the palm oil sector. the ngo called on us to terminate any
                                 business ­relationship with this client. while complying with our legal obligation to
                                 treat information on clients and client relationships confidentially, we agreed to meet
                                 with representatives of this ngo and discuss the issues in the palm oil sector in more
                                detail and learn about the situation in several countries, especially indonesia. the
                                ­representatives explained the changes they wanted to see, both with this specific
                                 ­client and in the sector more broadly. we explained our views, the nature of our client
                                relationships in general, how we have dealt with the issues so far and that we had
                                decided to seek dialogue with the client before any ­further action. the meeting with
                                the ngo did not result in agreement, but we made clear that we are aware of the
                                 importance of this issue and helped the ngo to understand our business, our role and
                                 the limitations of our influence in the short term.

                                  engaging with civil society
                                  we seek constructive discussions and exchanges with non-governmental organizations
                                  (ngos) – although we do not necessarily agree with certain conclusions that ngos draw,
                                  we value their input. in 2013, meetings with individual ngos revolved around topics
                                  such as monocultures, land grabbing and palm oil.

                                  in october 2013, we hosted the eighth dialogue session within the forum bankendialog.
                                  the event was organized by an environmental ngo at our company headquarters in
                                   frankfurt. during the session, representatives of various european banks discussed
                                   with ngos how well banks know their clients, their approach to analyzing the potential
                                  environmental and social impacts associated with clients’ activities and whether
                                  exclusion or engagement is the best way to help clients who exhibit negative
                                  ­sustainability performance. we are open to continuing these discussions in 2014.

                                  collaboration with financial institutions
                                  we believe that our impact is stronger if we collaborate with other banks – both
                                  ­individually and within groups – as well as interested organizations on es topics in
                                   general or on transaction-specific issues.

                                  deutsche bank is a member of the banking environment initiative (bei), which examines
                                  how to support efforts by the consumer goods forum (cgf) to drive deforestation
                                  out of companies’ supply chains. this initiative covers palm oil and other commodities
                                   such as timber, soy and beef, which together account for about half of global carbon
                                  emissions arising from deforestation. member banks work with the cgf committee
                                  on supply chains, aiming to bring all high-risk operations to verify that they are
                                  ­consistent with zero net deforestation by 2020, as based on the standards that the
                                   cgf is promoting.

                                  we also collaborate with other banks to improve disclosure of environmental and
                                  social risks in offer ­documents for capital markets transactions. the initial effort has
                                  focused on the extractive sector. the aim is to help investors make more informed
                                  decisions by encouraging issuers to be clear about material environmental and social
                                  issues and management plans to mitigate the risks. while many offer documents
                                  already include comprehensive disclosure, others fall short – for example by avoiding

                                we also conducted extensive dialogue with banks active in the thun group, which is
                                composed of banks interested in a better understanding of the un guiding principles
                                on business and human rights and how they can be best implemented in the banking
                                business. the group was supported by the university of zurich competence center
                                for human rights, a member of the swiss center of expertise for human rights
                                in developing a discussion paper that focuses on supporting the integration of key
                                ­guiding principles into the policies and practices of banking institutions. we will use
                                the proposed guidance to improve our own implementation of the principles.

                                engaging with clients
                                as a leading global bank, we inevitably have relationships with some companies that
                                are involved in activities with potentially significant environmental or social risks.
                                we monitor developments in these industries and aim to engage with clients in these
                                ­sectors. following initial analysis, we seek dialogue with clients to promote transparency
                                 and mutual understanding and to address difficult environmental and social issues
                                 over the medium term. we believe that conducting constructive dialogue best serves
                                 the transformation to a more sustainable future.

                                in 2013, we examined the textile industry in great detail following the rana plaza factory
                                fire in bangladesh. we found that the companies that assign production to such factories
                                have appropriate policies in place, have made commitments and support relevant
                                standards. in practice, however, these principles and standards were not always fully
                                implemented. to understand the reasons behind this, we initiated discussions with
                                specific clients in this sector. the lessons we drew from this dialogue will inform our
                                es risk assessments going forward.

    to capture new opportunities. our products and services
    must not only meet the demands of the economy, but
    also contribute to meeting social and environmental
    ­challenges. we seek to ensure that they provide value
     for clients, shareholders, employees and society at large.


    to achieve that goal, we have introduced initiatives and
    processes to balance the interests of private clients and
    investors, enhanced our approach to environmental,
    social and governance investing and we allocated more
    than us $1.2 billion to renewable energy projects.

                                    we aim to expand the products and services we offer to this sector, which we have
                                    segmented into four groups: corporate clients, family-run companies, self-employed

                                    in 2013, we restructured the banking services we provide to smes to combine local
                                    ­services with the expertise and reach of a global, universal bank. we created

                                     many smaller businesses are still primarily interested in classic bank loans, but
                                     the increase in global trade has rendered other services, such as international
                                     money transfers, trade finance and risk management much more important.

                                    in partnership with the european investment bank (eib), we instated a €400 million
                                    global loan this year, which can be accessed to provide low-interest credits with
                                    mid- to long-term financing to sme clients in germany, italy, poland and spain. through

                                to face the aftermath of the financial crisis throughout 2013. we therefore focused on
                                topics such as the ongoing uncertainty regarding the future development of ­capital

                                our fairshare™ principle
                                creating value for clients as well as shareholders is essential to responsible banking, and
                                we continually seek ways to anchor this concept in our business. this understanding
                                is at the core of the fairshare™ principle, which has been anchored in our private and
                                business client division since 2012.

                                the fairshare™ principle reflects the culmination of developments since 2008 to foster
                                a client-centric approach. these developments include transparent product information

                                creation for our clients within the fairshare™ principle. client performance indicators

                                in 2013, around 410,000 clients participated in our client satisfaction survey. their
                                responses show us how they perceive our services, how loyal they are to deutsche bank
                                and how they rate the quality of our advice. despite the difficult market situation,
                                we were able to improve the results in these fields in comparison to the year before.
                                the client loyalty index rose from 67.0 to 68.4 points in 2013; the quality of advice
                                also improved, increasing from 68.7 to 70.7 points.1

                                we use mystery shopping, a control mechanism that entails a third-party auditor acting
                                as a client, to check compliance with our quality and advisory standards. in 2013, we
                                carried out circa 8,600 test purchases and conducted approximately 7,500 telephone
                                interviews with clients following an advisory meeting. our mystery shopping index is
                                based on the results of these test purchases and client interviews. this index increased
                                from 82% to 83% in 2013. the results of our client satisfaction survey, test purchases
                                and client feedback contribute to the objectives we set for our branch offices.

promoting financial literacy
the amount of debt incurred by young people in germany
has quadrupled over the past ten years, increasing the
need for students to understand personal finance.

through our financial literacy initiative in the german
­market, deutsche bank employees make their expertise
 available to schools. they provide practical guidance to
 help students manage their money better and discuss
 ­topics ranging from the history of money and banking to
  the global financial markets in order to improve students’
  understanding of the economic system.

in other countries, we also promote financial understanding
via print and online media in order to maximize the reach
of these initiatives.                                                                   deutsche bank employees volunteer in schools

                                      risks and opportunities as significant for long-term returns. interest in dedicated drivers

                                      annual general meetings in particular is growing. this interest also extends to our
                                      high-net-worth clients, family offices, churches and foundations. responding to these
                                      ­developments, we are expanding on our previous involvement in the esg field.

                                      as a responsible investor, we believe that the integration of esg into our investment
                                      processes is part of our fiduciary duty. not only do we analyze the esg per­formance
                                      of companies we invest in, but we also support projects that tackle climate change or
                                      improve food security through our advisory mandates for impact investment funds.

                                      globally, the esg market accounts for nearly us $14 trillion, which indicates that
                                      approximately one fifth of all professionally managed assets incorporate esg factors.
                                      of these assets, 89% are comprised of institutional assets while retail assets make
                                      up the remaining 11%.1

                                      at the end of 2013, we managed and advised on €5.1 billion assets incorporating esg
                                      criteria and themes (2012: €4.5 billion), representing less than 1% of total assets under

                                           anchoring responsibility in asset and wealth management
esg assets under management                in 2013, we restructured our asset and wealth management activities to create a

                                            ­businesses. in line with the bank’s commitment to sustainability and in order to
                                             ­intensify and align our esg efforts across this new platform, we also established
                                           an esg head office. the head office unifies our esg expertise and supports

                                            new esg strategy across the entire asset and wealth management division. three
                                           ­pillars define this strategy:

                                           // risk management: produce in-depth esg research to support investment decisions
                                           and to reduce investment and business risks.

                                           and comply with processes.

                                           ­products and services.

                                           to demonstrate our commitment to responsible investing, our asset management
                                           business signed the united nations’ principles for responsible investing (pri) in 2008.
                                           we report our activities and progress towards implementing the principles according
                                           to the pri framework. as required by pri, our 2013 report will be publicly available for
                                           the first time.

                                           based on the historically greater prominence of responsibility as an investment theme
                                           in europe, we have mainly focused on applying the principles in our european activities.
                                           going forward, we seek to apply them in other regions as well.

                                           incorporating esg analysis into investment processes
                                           we strongly believe that an esg approach contributes to better investment
                                           decisions. it adds an extra dimension to investment analysis, helping us to better
                                           understand ­individual companies and the business environment they operate in.

our esg research process
our analysts and portfolio managers are provided with
raw esg data and detailed reports on more than
4,000 listed companies and on 130 countries by external
research ­providers. company data covers topics such as
environmental management, workers’ rights and quality
of reporting and disclosures. country data includes social
standards and treatment of natural resources. in addition,
our staff receives carbon-specific data on 2,500 companies
from an external research firm.

we use this raw data to create ratings based on company-
specific priorities. each company is rated on a scale from
a to f as compared to the median for the respective regional
investment universe. the rating therefore indicates how
well a company is managing the esg risks and opportunities
compared to its regional peers.

                                      focus on governance issues in our proxy voting activities.

                                    we also provide portfolio managers and analysts with guidance on esg issues to be

                                within the investment industry, we actively seek to advance esg implementation –

                                most ­influential bodies regarding esg investments such as eurosif and efama.

                                 to broaden understanding of esg investing, we published the white paper

    key social challenges – we enable talent, drive
    social change and promote art and music. corporate
    volunteering has become an integral part of our

    2,900 projects around the world.

    operations’ impact on the environment and have
    renewed our commitment to carbon neutrality.

                                       measuring change
                                       we are integrating our values and beliefs into people management tools such as
                                       objective setting, performance management, leadership, management assessment
                                       and people development tools.

                                       we are developing organizational metrics and systems to support the measurement
                                       and adoption of desired behaviors. this will be achieved through the use of client
                                       management information systems, client satisfaction metrics and performance
                                       ­measurement systems, including the creation of a scorecard with financial and non-
                                        financial metrics.



                                       managing operational transformation
                                       in 2013, we started a comprehensive project to better serve clients, tighten controls
                                       and improve cost-efficiency. the project not only includes the streamlining of our
                                       ­processes and the introduction of new technologies or ­systems, but also requires all
                                        employees to be open to new ways of thinking, which will lead to new habits and a
                                        very different approach to daily work.

                                       in the past, we may have underestimated the potential emotional effects of change.
                                       we have therefore developed a series of measures to support leaders and employees
                                       throughout the transformation. these include: guidelines on managing change; surveys
                                       to assess how employees are processing the change both mentally and emotionally;
                                       and coaching, workshops and trainings on how to increase efficiency.



                                       recruiting top talent
                                       the attraction and selection processes for new employees are key to the successful
                                       implementation of our values and beliefs. this affects not only new hires, but also our
                                       processes for internal mobility.

                                        our approaches to recruiting talent are tailored to our group-wide programs, divisions
                                        and regions as well as the requirements of the respective target groups. social media
                                        has proven very successful in our recruitment. in 2013, our german facebook careers

                                 in some countries, deutsche bank was ranked the 28th most attractive employer in

                                developing our employees
                                in 2013, we translated strategy 2015+ into a development approach that incorpor­ates
                                our values and beliefs by:

                                —	building capability across the organization and developing managers into
                                   future leaders

                                   the bank’s strategy

                                we aim to cultivate a broad pipeline of talent. we therefore invest in the professional
                                and personal development of all our employees. in 2013, we launched the career
                                ­mobility campaign, which is designed to encourage employees to explore opportunities
                                 within the bank. our intranet provides access to resources and information on open
                                 positions – all open positions for the vice president level and below are posted
                                 ­internally for two weeks. only if no suitable candidate is found are positions then
                                  posted externally.

                                appointing senior talent
                                a group-wide approach to the bank’s senior talent is crucial to building a strong
                                ­pipeline of future leaders who can guide sustainable performance, growth and the
                                 right culture in the long term. to this end, a people committee was formed in 2013.
                                 the committee is a formal body that steers and governs bank-wide strategic talent
                                 prac­tices. it is chaired by our co- ceos.

                                senior appointments are centrally coordinated to ensure that the most qualified talent
                                from across the bank is quickly identified for critical open positions. this is closely
                                linked to succession planning and supports cross-divisional mobility, development,
                                retention of key talent and greater progress on senior female appointments.



                                managing performance
                                differentiating performance and letting our employees know where they stand is
                                essential to rewarding them fairly and motivating them. we review employees’
                                ­performance based on both what they have achieved (performance objectives) and
                                 how they have achieved this (values and beliefs).

                                employees typically have two formal reviews with their direct manager each year –
                                a mid-year review and a year-end review. supported by ongoing informal conversations
                                throughout the year, these formal reviews present a coaching and feedback opportunity
                                to discuss performance and develop employees’ career goals. performance evaluations
                                conducted by managers also inform compensation and promotion decisions. we
                                ­support employees in reaching higher levels of performance by developing new skills
                                and capabilities through appropriate training and development programs.

                                in 2013, more than 95% of employees in scope completed a performance review using
                                the bank’s system for supporting employee performance and development.

                                aligning compensation with sustainable performance
                                public perceptions of compensation in the banking sector were generally very critical
                                in the wake of the financial crisis. redesigning our compensation and benefit schemes
                                is therefore important to our strategic employee initiatives.

                                in 2012, we commissioned an independent compensation review panel to assess
                                management compensation practices at deutsche bank. the panel’s review included
                                benchmarking the bank’s compensation systems against industry best practice as
                                well as current and expected regulatory requirements. the panel’s findings, published
                                in 2013, noted that “governance processes around the bank’s compensation structure,
                                decision-making and related disclosures are of a high standard.” the panel went on to
                                state that such processes should still, however, be evaluated regularly. we are in full

                                in accordance with local data protection and labor laws, we initiated a process to
                                compile a list of all employees (currently excluding non-managerial staff in germany)
                                who had received a disciplinary sanction during the year. the information collected
                                as well as the examination of the general context are considered when deciding on
                                individual compensation. we also include data from our red flags initiative in this
                                process. page 21

                                driving diversity
                                to be successful in the long term, we must have the right mix of skills and talents.
                                diversity is therefore anchored in our values and beliefs.

                                this year, we launched diversity strategy 2.0 to encourage and develop a more inclusive
                                and diverse culture and organization through concentrating on five key elements.

                                our leaders’ attitudes towards diverse points of view strongly influence team motivation,
                                results, innovation and collaboration. educating our leaders on diversity aspects is
                                therefore an essential element of our strategy 2015+.

                                in september 2013, we rolled out a new e-learning module, “great minds don’t think
                                alike – the power of different perspectives,” to all employees globally. this module
                                 presents employees with the opportunity to challenge their own assumptions
                                 and outlines ways to make fact-based decisions. the topic is also covered in half-day
                                ­leadership seminars that all managing directors and directors in germany are
                                required to attend. to date, 33% of managing directors and directors have completed
                                 the training.

                                deutsche bank shares in diversity best practice and is eager to learn from our peers.
                                the bank is a founding member and signatory of the charter de la diversidad in spain,
                                the charte de la diversité in luxembourg and the charta der vielfalt in germany.
                                deutsche bank was elected to the board of the german charter in january 2013.

                                promoting women
                                although the management board and the group executive committee currently
                                have no female members, we are committed to increasing diversity within these
                                bodies. we are therefore building a pipeline of senior talent to ensure better female
                                representation in our senior succession planning.

                                this year, the third cohort of women took part in the award-winning atlas
                                (accomplished top leaders advancement strategy) program and the fourth cohort
                                took part in the women global leaders program. both programs have proven to
                                be effective in increasing the number of women in leadership positions. more than
                                50% of the participants are now in positions with new or greater responsibilities.

                                delivering transparency
                                along with the other dax (german share index) companies, deutsche bank signed
                                a declaration in 2011 to increase the proportion of female senior managers to 25%
                                (managing director and director levels) and for all officer titles to 35% by the end of
                                2018, as subject to applicable laws worldwide.

                                we made further progress towards these targets this year. we increased the proportion
                                of female senior managers to 18.7% by the end of 2013, and of all officer titles to 31.1%.

                                        we regard the development of deutsche bank’s health management as an integral
                                        part of our corporate culture. we offer employees worldwide a wide range of health
                                        benefits such as medical checkups, an employee assistance program, flu vaccination,
                                        occupational health services and worldwide emergency services on business trips.
                                        these are complemented by a variety of programs and initiatives. we introduced a
                                        health portal in germany as a new feature to our system.

                                        we aim to empower employees to work and manage their family commitments
                                        ­effectively. where possible, we provide flexible working arrangements for parents
                                         that include opportunities to work from home, shared jobs or part-time employment.

                                half the properties signed with green leases are leed certified.

                                our global standard for green lease contracts includes the landlord’s agreement to
                                measure energy use in tenant space using direct metering or submetering, which is
                                necessary to gather data on our own energy use. in 2013, we secured submetering or

                                      when employees do have to travel, we encourage them to use green hotels wherever
                                      possible. a green hotel must score 80% or higher on our green hotel scorecard, which
                                      addresses issues such as carbon offsetting, energy efficiency, water conservation,
                                      waste management and green product sourcing. around 45% of our preferred hotels
                                      meet this standard.




passion for the planet
beyond our efforts in eco-efficiency for our operations, we
provide our employees with opportunities to participate in
volunteering activities that address environmental issues.

 in hong kong, for example, employees work with a
 local ngo on the eco-paddy program, which promotes
­traditional rice farming to help conserve agricultural
 wetland – a natural habitat for several endangered
 ­species. deutsche bank employees and their families
  help with farming activities and learn about eco-paddy
  farming and conservation.

in germany, more than 3,400 employees have volunteered
with trinkwasserwald, an organization that promotes
­diversity in forests to protect drinking water sources.

in the past four years, they have planted a total of
45,000 trees to provide an additional 12 million liters of                                                   employees increase

                                data on energy consumption, greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, waste, paper, and
                                water consumption are consolidated in a global database that systematically analyses
                                data using tens of millions of data points covering the past seven years. tools in the
                                database enable analysis of environmental initiatives and performance, for example
                                highlighting how renewable electricity has reduced carbon emissions. the system
                                monitors and estimates key indicators based on present data and trends, so that
                                annual carbon emissions can be forecast and offsets purchased at the appropriate
                                level to meet our neutrality targets. data covers all locations, presently with more
                                than 70% of our energy use from actual metered or invoiced data.

                                on the basis of these data, consumption is extrapolated for non-reporting sites and to
                                get our total energy consumption and ghg emissions. these data are quantified and
                                 reported in line with the international ghg standard iso 14064. waste, paper, and
                                water data are also captured in this database. the data for waste comes from locations
                                with iso 14001 certification in germany, japan, london, and new york. the figures
                                 for consumption of copier paper are collected in ten countries including germany,
                                ­singapore, the uk, and the us, and cover more than 70% of employees. the water

              we calculate this adjusted measure of our return on average shareholders’ equity to make it easier to compare us to our
              competitors. we refer to this adjusted measure as our “pre-tax return on average active equity.” however, this is not
              a measure of performance under ifrs, and you should not compare our ratio based on average active equity to other
              companies’ ratios without considering the differences in the calculation of the ratio. the items for which we adjust the
              average shareholders’ equity of €56.1 billion for 2013 and €55.6 billion for 2012 are average dividends of €646 million in
              2013 and €670 million in 2012, for which a proposal is accrued on a quarterly basis and which are paid after the approval
              by the annual general meeting following each year.
