a healthy balance in its employees'
professional and family lives, offering the
best working conditions in each case
and guaranteeing equal opportunities.

key amongst these family support
activities is the family plan, a

children of cepsa group employees.

of action have been followed to
help these youngsters become more
independent and better integrated in
society and the professional world.

in line with its concern for social
matters and within its employee
support policy, in 2014, the

classification
and labelling
of products

the united nations' globally
harmonised system (ghs) has the
aim of standardising all information
relating to the danger posed by certain
chemicals. by means of regulation
1272/2008 on classification, labelling
and packaging (clp), the ghs defines a
framework to classify, label and package
these chemicals, which has favoured
the internationalisation of our products
thanks to our strict adherence to
this regulation.

although this regulation only applies
to chemical substances, as from 2015,
it will also cover mixtures, which is
why cepsa has taken a step ahead
and is currently classifying and labelling                           focused overview
mixtures as specified by the clp
regulation, whereby safety data sheets
and labels will include the required

in this regard, environmental and
social impact studies are fundamental
items in these processes. in the
area of exploration and production,
before embarking on a project, the
company identifies the stakeholder
groups involved and carries out initial
diagnostics to define sensitive areas
in the social, legal and environmental
contexts. similarly, the needs of the
communities living near the facilities are
identified and assessed, and steps are
taken to ensure the participation of all
groups concerned.

as regards the industrial activity, the
facilities are in areas close to urban
settlements, so the company maintains
close relations with its neighbours and

channels of communication, among
