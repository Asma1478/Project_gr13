"our urban mixed-use
 shopping centre philosophy
 proved to be very resilient."
    we want to connect with our
customers both online and offline.
with our cityconline programme we
will continue to expand our offering of
digital services and experiences to our
customers and tenants.

commitment to one citycon
all of our actions this year have been
governed by a true commitment to
strengthening ‘one citycon’ and hence
driving corporate efficiency. today we
see ourselves as a nordic player working
smoothly across borders. in june we also
appointed a new coo, jurn hoeksema,
with broad international experience.
under his operational leadership we will
reach a new level in benchmarking our
operational results and sharing best
practices within the company.
    without the great support and
dedication of our motivated and
professional staff the company would
never have reached the position it is in
today. therefore, i am grateful to work in
such an environment every day, one that
makes me excited to work towards an
even better future for citycon.

the overall arrangement strengthened
citycon’s credit profile and both s&p and
moody’s upgraded citycon’s corporate
credit ratings by one notch to bbb (s&p)
and baa2 (moody's).
    following the upgrading of credit
ratings, we successfully placed a strategic
eur 350 million 10-year eurobond in
september-october at 2.5% annual fixed
coupon. the eurobond was oversubscribed
and the offering was closed within a few
hours. the bond proceeds were mainly used
to prepay existing debt thereby extending
average debt maturities and decreasing
the average cost of debt. just before year
end we signed a eur 500 million revolving
credit facility, which completed our
refinancing.

the coverage of energy and associated ghg disclosure is 99% of gla under operative control.

1)	citycon’s reported energy consumption covers shopping centres and other retail properties where citycon’s share of ownership is at least 50% and where citycon has operational control (excluding one property
    in which citycon is not responsible for energy procurement). kista galleria's environmental data is included in its entirety for 2014. kista galleria’s environmental data is not included for previous years.
2)	citycon also reports the tenants' electricity consumption in cases where citycon is responsible for electricity procurement. when energy procurement is on tenant’s responsibility, it has been excluded
    from reporting.
3)	energy used for heating and cooling is reported in its entirety. heating consumption has not been normalised.
4)	in terms of intensity figures, citycon has limited the reported electricity consumption to common areas, where it can directly influence. this includes the electricity used for general lighting, ventilation
    and cooling, as well as lifts and escalators and other building technical systems.
5)	excl. fruängen centrum and högdalen centrum and myllypuro where amount of visitors is not collected.
6)	the reported consumption includes the headquarters, other offices are integrated into shopping centres. headquarters' heating, water and waste amounts are excluded from reporting as they are included
    in the rent and not reported separately to citycon.

1)	citycon has made an adjustment to its accounting policies related to the treatment of transaction costs arising
    from the investment property disposals in 2012. previously citycon reported transaction costs from the property
    disposals within the administrative expenses, but in the financial statements 2012, citycon has netted the
    transaction costs from the successful property disposals against the net gains on sale of investment properties.
    the adjustment doesn’t impact the epra earnings.
