                                        a message from our ceo


                                        dear valued stakeholder,

                                        i am pleased to report that our company made
                                        considerable headway in implementing sustainability
                                        best practices during 2010, both within our internal
                                        operations as well as on behalf of our hundreds of
                                        clients on projects in a variety of global locations.
                                        in the 2009 sustainability report, we featured one of our most important relationships: the
                                        alignment of our sustainability agenda with those of our clients. in that report, clients
                                        defined what they expect from us in addressing their sustainability challenges, even during a
                                        period of global recession. they characterized the application of our experience, expertise
                                        and commitment to their sustainability challenges as critical to their success. clearly, if it’s
                                        critical to their success, it’s critical to ours — not only to our bottom line but also to meeting
                                        our own sustainability commitment.

                                        in this 2010 report, we take the next step. while defining our progress in a wide range of
                                        areas, we illustrate specific ways in which we help our clients meet their sustainability goals. for
   david t. seaton                      example, in 2009 we introduced a companywide fluor sustainability manual — a comprehensive
   chief executive officer              compilation of best practices that integrates sustainability into our own processes and those we
                                        provide to clients on construction projects. in this way, these practices become more routinely
                                        and consistently a part of day-to-day operations.

                                        it is our practice to meet with clients and align on sustainability goals and specific steps we will
                                        take to achieve those goals. we and our clients find that utilizing such an approach offers clear
                                        benefits and can even be transformative. to illustrate this process and the related benefits in
                                        “real life” terms, we feature three project examples in this 2010 report.

                                    beyond our project world, the year 2010 was also productive in many other ways. whether the
                                    aim was to improve our approach to health, safety and the environment, strengthen corporate
                                    governance, further encourage ethical behavior and compliance, support our employees while
                                    creating a more effective workplace, or increase community and social service, we made notable
                                    gains. we also observed once again that while there may be differences of opinion regarding
                                    approaches in public policy to global climate change, our clients look to us to help them address
                                    this challenge.

                                    whether an issue is policy- or technically-driven, fluor has built a reputation for creating
                                    and applying innovative solutions to the most difficult problems. in 2010, we were productive
                                    in developing innovative technologies that support sustainability objectives. alone or with
                                    partners, we worked to destroy methane-rich gas from landfills and generate power as a
                                    byproduct; address water needs in shale gas development; demonstrate carbon capture at a
                                    coal-fired power plant; create a dry energy storage technology that is operational in remote
                                    locations, cost effective and reliable; apply our solid fuel generation expertise to the growing
                                    biomass market; and design a power grid system at a critical military installation in kabul,
                                    afghanistan, to reduce the demand for generator fuel and reduce exposure to vulnerable
                                    fuel delivery.

                                    i am particularly proud that fluor continues to be a leader in the elimination or reduction
                                    of corrupt business practices. as stakeholders well know, fluor was a founder of the world
                                    economic forum’s (wef) partnering against corruption initiative (paci) in 2004. we
                                    continue to provide important leadership to paci as well as to the wef’s global agenda
                                    council on corruption. in addition, i am proud to serve as chair of the forum’s effort to
                                    provide a global business perspective on corruption to this year’s meeting of g-20 leaders,
                                    which is being hosted by france.

                                    fluor is also a signatory to the united nations global compact, a commitment that i am
                                    pleased to reconfirm. we believe that the global compact’s 10 principles truly reflect
                                    fluor’s operating philosophies, standards and processes. our progress in abiding by these
                                    10 principles is outlined in this stakeholder report.

                                    while fluor and others have come far and accomplished much, we understand that sustainability
                                    is a marathon, not a sprint. progress in one area is often followed by new challenges. one such
                                    challenge relates to the global utilization of natural resources. as we well know, countries that
                                    are often the richest in natural resources are sometimes among the poorest economically, with
                                    extreme levels of conflict and corruption. as growing populations and their drive toward higher
                                    standards of living continue to propel the demand for natural resources, we must once again call
                                    upon world leaders to stand strong against the risks inherent in natural resource management. in
                                    this regard, fluor strongly supports the responsible resource development initiative launched
                                    last year under the auspices of the mineral and mining sector of the wef.

                                    i applaud and thank my predecessor, alan boeckmann, for his strong leadership in enhancing
                                    sustainability within fluor and around the world. as a result of his leadership, fluor has been
                                    honored with a series of awards over the past 10 years. in 2010, for example, the ethisphere
                                    institute again named us one of the world’s most ethical companies, an honor in which we
                                    take enormous pride.

                                    but with or without such awards, fluor will remain committed to practicing sustainability at a
                                    level consistent with stakeholder expectations and requirements. as fluor’s new ceo, i am
                                    honored to carry on a nearly 100-year legacy of sustainability that fluor has cultivated with our
                                    key stakeholders. the sustainable practices of our employees have been a natural part of our
                                    builder’s culture all these years and are integral to our company’s strategies, daily operations and
                                    success. recognizing that we — citizens, corporations, governments and communities — live in
                                    a fast-moving, interconnected and complex world, it is incumbent upon us to work collectively
                                    to achieve a shared vision of sustainability. and while our work is complex, our commitment
                                    is simple: succeed today without compromising tomorrow.

         overview



     the responsibility
     of leadership.
                               achieving true sustainability requires commitment, but
                               it also requires an understanding that sustainability is
                               an ongoing process. as a global leader and responsible
                               partner, fluor has always striven to be forward-looking,
                               innovative and transparent — because above all else,
                               we believe in leading by example.

         nearly 100 years ago, early fluor employees were building
         sustainability into their work and creating a legacy for
         all who came after them. conducting business in a socially,
         economically and environmentally responsible way has
         always been fundamental to meeting our clients’ needs, and
         never more so than today.
         with fluor’s recently issued sustainability manual,
         all employees have a comprehensive, effective guide to
         sustainable work practices that distinguishes us in
         the industry.

         from a bridge to a gas recovery project, from an isolated
         island to a teeming metropolis, fluor’s people are
         employing the manual and their own expertise to imagine
         and implement methods to safeguard the environment,
         improve communities and strengthen economies.

         in partnership with our clients, fluor continues to build
         a legacy for all who will come after us.

   one, for the use of high-density insulation for the
   gas lines that will reduce operational costs and
   conserve energy; and another aimed at recycling

   curll and john agree that, as the jbog project
   moves from the office to the field site, the
   sustainability manual will continue to guide the
   team’s decisions and will be further integrated
   with qatargas’ own corporate citizenship
   initiatives. they anticipate the large, multinational
   workforce in ras laffan, where fluor will support
   the construction, commissioning and start-up
   phases of the project, will receive sustainability
   manual information online and at regular town
   hall-type meetings.
  “as we implement sustainability ideas, workers
   will see the steps we’re taking and ask about them,
   giving us another opportunity to explain the
   concepts,” john reports. “that will spark their
   thoughts and encourage more ideas, because
   when workers can see tangible results coming from
   using the manual, it puts life into the concepts.”
