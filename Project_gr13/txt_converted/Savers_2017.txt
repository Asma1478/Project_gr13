           when we throw away our used clothes and household
           goods, we are also throwing away the raw materials
           used to make them. consider the environmental
           impact of what goes into making a common, everyday
           outfit: a t-shirt and pair of blue jeans. it can take
           up to 700 gallons of water to make one new cotton
           t-shirt—more than the average person drinks in
           five years—and more than 1,800 gallons of water to
