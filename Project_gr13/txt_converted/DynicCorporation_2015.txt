                                basic environmental policy


  [basic environmental policy of dynic]
       dynic corporation is aware the efforts toward environmental preservation are an important
   business challenge and believes it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to observe domestic and
   overseas laws and regulations related to the environment and provide products with less environ-
   mental burden to the markets. to implement the concept in a specific manner, we will thoroughly
   promote the following items in each of the stages, including development, material procurement,
   manufacturing, sales, distribution, and disposal.

   (1) we will reduce the environmental burden in all stages of our business activities throughout the life
       cycle of the products;
   (2) we will proactively make efforts to save energy and reduce waste, thereby preventing environ-
       mental contamination;
   (3) we will prevent risk caused by harmful chemical substances that damage the environment;
   (4) we will disclose information regarding our business activities related to the environment and
       proactively promote environment preservation activities, while acting in concert with local com-
       munities; and
   (5) we will implement education related to environmental preservation, thereby improving awareness
       of the environment.
                                                                               yoshio oishi, president
                                                                               dynic corporation


■efforts for reducing environmental burden
     we are introducing the manufacturing method that features less of an energy burden and implement-
ing product design where resource saving and longer service life are taken into consideration; in addition,
we consider materials that feature less of an environmental burden and materials that are easy to recycle
from the design phase of the product. in the manufacturing phase, we make efforts to save energy and
reduce waste in the manufacturing scene every day, thereby contributing to the reduction in the environ-
mental burden. in the marketing phase, we propose environmentally friendly products that reduce the
environmental burden at the customer by using the products, thereby making efforts to contribute to the
environmental preservation of the earth.

■efforts for countermeasures against global warming and biodiversity conservation
     we are promoting countermeasures against global warming through our efforts for energy-saving
activities throughout dynic, thereby reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. in addition, regarding the biodi-
versity conservation, we are making efforts toward coexistence with the global environment through our
activities toward risks, including countermeasures against global warming.

                                     activity status 2014

●regional contribution activities
     we named two asteroids, which our astronomical observatory “dynic astro-park tenkyukan” in the
shiga factory discovered, “tomiokamachi” and “heiankyo” and they were registered. based on our
concept “contributing to global environmental protection by knowing other planets,” we have been using
the names of regional areas for asteroid names, thereby achieving regional contribution. this time, we
determined to make a contribution to kyoto prefecture, which is the birthplace of the company, and we
reported the naming of “heiankyo” to the kyoto prefectural government.




●heat-shielding construction
     we applied special heat-shielding sheets behind the ceiling of the office building and the engineering
building of the shiga factory. the indoor heat will be retained and the outdoor heat will not be taken into
rooms through the use of this shielding, and the operational load of air conditioning can eventually be
reduced, which contributes to a significant reduction in energy consumption and co2 emissions.

●exhaust heat recovery equipment
     the machines newly installed in the saitama factory are
equipped with exhaust heat recovery equipment, thereby
enhancing further energy savings and a reduction in co2 emis-
sions. a duct that is capable of re-circulating and reusing the
exhaust heat is installed at the upper part of the dryer to achieve
a significant reduction in fuel use.




●transformer with higher efficiency
     the 1200 kva transformer of the moka factory was replaced with one with higher efficiency. since
the transformer had been used under a low load factor, the capacity was lowered to the adequate
capacity of 750 kva, which is best suited for the load. the introduction of higher-efficiency transformers
and the revision of the capacity contributed to the achievement of a significant reduction in co2 emis-
sions and lower operation noise.




                                         replacement with higher-efficiency type




●led lighting
      we are sequentially replacing the fluorescent ceiling lights
of the moka factory with led lighting, reducing the power
consumption by 55% compared to fluorescent lamps. in addi-
tion, since led lighting has the effect of not attracting insects, it
also contributes to quality improvement.

 measures for global warming/energy saving
       in our production activities, we create products by consuming energy. as a result, we emit co2, a global warming gas. with
the goal of reduction in co2 emissions, we are making efforts to reduce the consumed energy in the production processes. we are
developing our activities under the goal of reducing the gas by 1% every year as compared with 2009. as investments in energy-
saving equipment, we have been implementing the replacement of ceiling lights (mercury lamps) of factories with led lamps,
change of transformers to the higher-efficiency type, change of air conditioners to the higher-efficiency type, change of compressors
to the centralized type, and the change of lights in office buildings to led lamps.
       regarding the business performance in fiscal 2014, we could not achieve the goal since the specific energy consumption
deteriorated. on the other hand, co2 emissions were reduced due to the reduced production, and we could suppress the emissions
below the target value. in fiscal 2015, we will implement energy efficiency improvement measures that comply with the reduced
production and work harder toward the achievement of our goal.

resource saving/ waste reduction
●effective utilization of water resources
     we at dynic are also working on the effective utilization of water resources throughout the company. in our
production processes, we have been making efforts to reduce the total water resource input and the total drain-
age volume by promoting the recycling of used cleaning water, cooking water, etc. in fiscal 2014, we achieved a
reduction of the total water reresource input by about 17% and the total drainage volume by about 16%
compared to fiscal 2006.

       ●reduction in waste
            we are working on the reduction of waste to protect the global environment. for our activities, we have been
       promoting reuse and recycling not only for the purpose of reducing the total quantity of waste, but also from the
       viewpoint of the effective utilization of resources. regarding the total quantity of materials used, we could achieve
       a reduction of 18.8% from 37,129 tons in 2010 to 30,166 tons in 2014. although the total quantity of waste was
       slightly on the uptrend in 2014 and thereafter, the final disposal quantity of waste has been reduced year by year
       as a result of promoting reuse and recycling, thus resulting in a reduction of 56% compared to 2006.

  reduction in chemical substance release
     we have been reporting the quantity of release of chemical substances in use into the environment accord-
ing the prtr system based on the law concerning pollutant release and transfer register, and we are working
on a reduction thereof.
     the total drainage volume in fiscal 2014 remained almost the same as the fiscal 2013 performance, but the
total moving amount was reduced by 4.8%. in fiscal 2015, we introduced combustion-type voc processing
equipment. as a result, a further reduction in the total drainage volume can be expected.
