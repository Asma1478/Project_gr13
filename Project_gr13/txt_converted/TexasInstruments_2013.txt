letter from our ceo
sustainability is a lasting evolution at texas instruments that
challenges us to think about what we’re doing today and what
we want to achieve tomorrow. it is a journey that goes beyond
our next earnings report and any unforeseen ups and downs
year-to-year.

our progress along this path in 2011 was no different. the
devastating earthquake and tsunami in japan, global economic
uncertainty and flooding in thailand impacted our production,
our supply chain, our employees and our local communities. i’m
proud of our response and the strides we made as a company
to put our response plans into action, while continuing to adapt.

during the year, ti also made some significant improvements
and investments toward building a better world, including:
• 134 energy-efficiency and water conservation projects that
  saved $8.6 million in utility costs.
• 1.5 billion gallons of water and 92 percent of waste recycled.
• full staffing of our motor driver lab as a proving ground for
  more efficient technology; an estimated 60 percent of the
  world’s electricity is used by motors.
• $22.2 million contributed to education improvement and local
  communities. ti and the ti foundation gave $14.6 million
  for more effective science and math education to grow the
  number of students ready to pursue careers in technology.
• almost $1 million contributed to disaster relief in japan by the
  ti foundation and employees.
• a new supplier environmental and social responsibility policy
  that requires critical alignment of our expectations for ethics,
  labor practices and environmental controls.

our aim now is to turn great preparation into great results. our
five-year sustainability goals, to reduce energy, water and
greenhouse gas emissions per chip, will help keep us on track.

i have an unshakable belief that the best is yet to come as
technology makes a better world – one that is more exciting,
more interactive, more connected and more efficient. we
commit to doing our part by helping create problem-solving
technology while continuing to grow responsibly.

               company operations

2011 performance

sustainability
• set annual targets to guide continued improvements, including employee safety

  and reduced chemical use.
• launched a global, year-long campaign to educate employees on what

  sustainability is, what it means to the company, what we aim to achieve, and
  how each individual can help ti become a more sustainable company.
• continued work toward our five-year energy, water and greenhouse gas (ghg)

  emissions per chip reduction goals. although our performance declined in each
  of the areas due to the ramp-up of new facilities and reduced production (which
  impacts efficiency), we made strides in identifying best practices and worked to
  implement these at ti sites globally.

business continuity
• mitigated production and supply-chain impacts resulting from the march

  earthquake and tsunami in japan, and flooding in thailand. ti was one of the
  first companies to assess and communicate its production and revenue impacts,
  and a recovery timeline, to both customers and investors.
• launched a supplier risk solutions portal that geographically locates our suppliers

  worldwide. it also assesses the business continuity preparedness and planning
  of our supply chain.
• strengthened our ability to meet customers’ needs through the acquisition of

  national semiconductor and use of its global suppliers.
• certified as compliant with the u.s. custom trade-partnership against

  terrorism program.

supplier stewardship
• developed a new supplier environmental and social responsibility policy,

  which contains ti’s expectations for not only humane treatment, human rights
  and ethics, but also more stringent environmental controls and performance.
• expanded our supply-chain assessments to include suppliers’ programs and

  performance related to human rights, and humane treatment in their labor and
  ethical business practices. after examining nearly 200 of our most critical
  suppliers, ti conducted more in-depth assessments of 22 vendors. no major
  findings were identified; minor issues were either resolved or are being addressed.
• put processes in place to comply with emerging conflict minerals legislation.

• recognized by three texas organizations for fostering a business environment

  that promotes access and opportunity for minority-owned businesses. ti spent
  5 percent ($204 million) with certified minority- and women-owned prime
  suppliers in the u.s.

               company operations            2011 corporate citizenship report summary | 8




looking ahead

  companies that work together to improve efficiency and social, ethical and
  environmental responsibility within companies and their global supply chains.
• invest in processes that further reduce energy, water and ghg emissions and

  associated costs.
• conduct risk assessments at former national semiconductor sites and integrate

  the facilities into ti’s incident management program.
• take a holistic look at how we evaluate political, operational and sustainability-

  focused supply-chain risks to improve how these are managed moving forward.
• ensure that suppliers understand and comply with our new environmental and

  social responsibility requirements and expectations.
• begin integrating suppliers’ environmental and social responsibility scores into

  cetraq, a tool that assesses supplier performance on cost, environment,
  technology, responsiveness, assurance of supply and quality.
• spend at least 5 percent of u.s. procurement dollars with minority- and women-

  owned suppliers. we will also engage with national semiconductor’s former
  suppliers to ensure that they understand our commitment to doing business with
  certified and diverse enterprises.

               product stewardship

2011 performance

innovation
• increased r&d investments by about $145 million (up from $1.57 billion in 2010).

• launched an external ti innovation website to better represent and communicate

  the scope of our activities to customers, investors and prospective employees.
• signed a 10-year memorandum of understanding with the china ministry of

  education in support of china’s university education and the cultivation of
  electronics engineering talent.
• enabled nearly 20,000 students to participate in ti’s global analog design

  competitions.
• announced the first two commercial products that were derived from technology

  developed in ti’s kilby labs.

sustainable product design
• helped forge an agreement to develop a common charger for data-enabled mobile

  phones in europe. this will eliminate an estimated 51,000 tons of electronic waste
  per year.
• announced the world’s first color graphing calculator, the ti-nspire cx. it

  contains rechargeable batteries, which extends its power and eliminates the need
  for single-use batteries.
• fully staffed our motor driver lab, a proving ground for more efficient technology,

  since an estimated 60 percent of the world’s electricity is used by motors.
• enabled one customer to create a new led light bulb that requires 7 watts, yields

  more than 400 lumens of light and can last for 25 years.

               product stewardship          2011 corporate citizenship report summary | 10




sustainable manufacturing
• ensured that more than 90 percent of the semiconductor products we ship

  are considered “ti-green” (including those that meet low-halogen industry
  requirements).
• unveiled a new powerstack™ packaging technology, a unique 3-d solution

  that essentially stacks semiconductor chips vertically, reducing board space
  by about half. this reduces total energy and cooling costs, which allows our
  customers to make smaller electronics that are more powerful yet efficient
  to operate.
• upgraded educational technology retail packaging to reduce the amount of

  polyvinyl chlorides within them by 50 percent.
• stopped including batteries that contain more than 5 parts per million of

  mercury in our education technology products.
• monitored ever-changing manufacturing laws and regulations to ensure

  compliance with all applicable standards and certifications.
• began evaluating and implementing additional manufacturing controls at former

  national semiconductor fabrication sites in the u.s., malaysia and scotland.

• open new r&d centers in shanghai, china, and silicon valley labs in

  santa clara, california.
• spend at least 12 percent of ti’s revenue on r&d programs.

• expand our portfolio in utility metering, home and building automation,

  and smart grid infrastructure technology.
