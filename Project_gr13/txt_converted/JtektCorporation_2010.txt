nurturing, connecting.
in february of 2009, jtekt established a csr promotion committee.
a year has passed, and we are still in the stage of asking ourselves
“what kind of csr would best express jtekt?”
but the jtekt csr sprout is indeed growing bigger.
internally we are extending the roots of csr,
while externally we are broadening the branches of communication.
this report is intended as a tool to show our stance
of further making efforts to enrich csr
as well as a tool to think how to progress toward the future.

 systems supporting csr
 “corporate governance”, “compliance” and “risk management”
 - the three pillars supporting sincere business activities and promoting csr.



 the 3 pillars of sincere business activities
 at jtekt, we believe that the continual implementation
 of sincere business activities is connected to the
 promotion of csr. one thing that is essential to sincere                                                         h^cxzgz

 management style that observes statutory and social
 norms. the three pillars, “corporate governance”,
 “compliance” and “risk management”, are positioned
 as important mechanisms to achieve this. all of these

 corporations however the important thing is whether
 they are actually being implemented or not. at jtekt,                                                 8dgedgviz<dkzgcvcxz

 we have many ideas on how to effectively function each
 of these mechanisms.

     jtekt technology,
     helping to build a society
     where people can lead secure lives.
     advancements in various industry technologies such as cars,
     energy and so on, have brought convenience
     and luxuriance to people’s lives.
     on the other hand, securing safety against accidents on the road
     and in the workplace is becoming a major issue of concern.
     the first step of jtekt’s csr is to be strongly
     aware of this issue facing society
     and actively pursue a solution.
     this special report singles out but a few products
     from the many examples available and introduces
     how jtekt is contributing to the building of a safe society.

          a car travels by transmitting engine power
          to the tires. jtekt’s itcc (electronically
          controlled 4wd coupling) and torsen (torque
          sensing differential for fulltime 4wd) respond
          to changes in the driving environment, and
          distribute engine power optimally to the front
          and back wheels.
          these devices are used in many 4wd vehicles
          around the world.
          in particular, the itcc transmits engine power                                                    idgh:c
          to the front wheels during normal driving, and
          transfers power to the back wheels when the
          front ones are about to slip, hence avoiding
          spin. this device achieves both fuel efficiency                                                  >i88

     jtekt csr report 2010



     social report


     strengthening connections to
     further enhance the csr.

     jtekt’s activities are made possible through relationships
     with various stakeholders such as
     the customer, business partners, employees,
     local communities, shareholders, investors and so on.


     a year has passed since the establishment of
     the csr promotion committee, and at jtekt,
     awareness on csr is beginning to become entrenched.
     what is important to us now is,
     while strengthening our communication with each and every stakeholder,
     is also to ask ourselves the questions
     “what is csr?”, “what can we do for society?”.
     we must then take action and aim to contribute to societal development.
     this report introduces how jtekt are making efforts to promote csr
     while conscientiously holding dialogue with stakeholders.

paper: we use paper containing pulp manufactured from wood certified by fsc (forest
stewardship council) or from wood harvested in forests controlled by fsc. furthermore, in the
paper manufacturing process, ecf (elemental chlorine free) bleach is adopted. ecf uses a
bleaching agent that generates organnochlorine compounds such as dioxin as an alternative to
the conventional pulp bleach which generates chlorine gas.
printing: resources and energy are saved with the use of ctp (computer to plate) photoengraving,
which does not require film that uses developing ink. waterless printing, which does not require
dipping water containing harmful material, is adopted. this report is printed at a printing factory
which has acquired iso9001 certification.
ink: soy ink containing soy oil in solvent is used to suppress hazardous material volatilization.
bookbinding: hot-melt adhesive for bookbinding certificated by the japan adhesive industry
association is used to reduce environmental burden when recycling used paper.
