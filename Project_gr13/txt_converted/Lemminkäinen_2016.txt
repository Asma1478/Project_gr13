impact of the changes in accounting policy on comparison year's segment reporting figures
lemminkäinen has changed its accounting policy for segment reporting as of 1 january 2015. according to the changed
accounting policy the company reports the operating capital for each segment to the chief operating decision maker. the
operating capital reported by the company consists of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and net
working capital. the net working capital includes inventories, current trade and other receivables, provisions, current trade and
other payables as well as income tax receivables and liabilities. however, the net working capital allocated to the segments
excludes accrued personnel expenses and interest, accruals related to derivatives as well as accrued direct and indirect taxes.
these figures are reported separately as items unallocated to segments.

3 seasonality of business
seasonality of certain operations of the company affects the company’s profit and its timing. weather conditions influence the
lengths of the paving segment’s paving and mineral aggregates businesses working seasons, which affects the company’s
profit and its timing. the working seasons of these businesses and consequently their profits take place mostly in the second
and third quarters. in addition, there may be some seasonality in the infra projects segment’s foundation engineering business
due to the timing of building construction projects.

revenue from residential and non-residential development projects is recognised, for the sold proportion, on completion which
causes seasonal fluctuations to the company’s profit. the company seeks to balance this fluctuation by launching new
developed projects evenly throughout the year in which case the projects will be completed and revenue from them is recognised
as evenly as possible throughout the year.

service concession arrangements
lemminkäinen currently has six major ongoing life cycle projects, where subscribers are the municipalities of kuopio, oulu,
pudasjärvi, hollola and porvoo. in each of the projects, lemminkäinen refurbishes an old or builds a new building for the
municipality as well as maintains the building in question for a service period specified in the contract. the municipality owns
both the buildings and the land area where the buildings are located in each of the life cycle projects. in all of the contracts, the
municipality has the right to terminate the contract during the service period under certain terms and conditions taking into
consideration the interests of the service provider. the prices of both the construction phase and the service period have been
tied to a building cost index according to which the prices are reviewed annually. lemminkäinen does not have a significant
right to organize supplementary use for any of the properties. key information on each of the projects is presented in the table
below.

the company has recorded the deferred tax assets from tax losses to the amount it considers, based on its profit forecasts, to
be utilisable in the future. the amount of tax losses has increased especially due to non-recurring items, which are not expected
to reoccur in the future. a large part of the tax losses in finland arise from the damages that the district court ordered in 2013
related to the asphalt cartel. at the end of 2015, tax losses in the group's finnish companies totalled eur 19.4 million (23.1)
and they can be carried forward for 10 years. the amount of tax losses in the group's norwegian companies stood at eur 11.5
million (12.1) at the end of 2015, and they can be carried forward indefinitely. the amount of the company’s tax losses, from
which deferred tax asset has not been recorded, is not material.

no deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of the undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries because the funds are
permanently invested in operations abroad.

goodwill
at the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected
to benefit from synergies arising from the business combination. the company’s business was organised into four operating
segments at the beginning of 2015. the reportable new operating segments correspond to the business based management
model. furthermore, the operating segments are the lowest level at which the company management monitors goodwill and the
level on which the goodwill is tested. before the segment change goodwill was monitored at country level.

goodwill impairment tests

goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there are indications of possible impairment. the tests are carried out
as value-in-use calculations of individual businesses in accordance with the smallest cash-generating unit principle. in
impairment testing the discounted present value of the recoverable cash flows of each cash-generating unit is compared with
the carrying amount of the unit in question. if the present value is lower than the carrying amount, the difference is recognised
through profit or loss as an expense in the current year.

the goodwill impairment tests carried out during the fourth quarter of 2015, showed that the present values of the future cash
flows exceed the carrying amounts in all segments.

forecasts and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing

cash generating units’ cash flow forecasts are prepared for a four year planning period based on management estimates based
on actual past performance. main assumptions used in the preparation of the cash flow forecasts are the growth of the market
in question, the company’s profitability development as well as measures which the company has committed to.

main assumptions in the goodwill impairment testing are long term growth and discount rate. cash flow forecasts beyond the
four year planning period are based on the assumption of 1 percent annual growth which was lower than european central
bank's target inflation rate over medium term in effect at the time of the impairment testing. weighted average cost of capital
(wacc), calculated for each individual unit, is used as the discount factor. wacc takes into account risk-free interest rate,
illiquidity premium, expected market rate of return, the industry’s beta value, country risk and debt interest rate including
interest rate margin calculated for each unit. when determining the debt interest rate level in 2015, the company took into
account the following segment-specific interest rate levels: interest rate levels for project loans in building construction in
finland as well as interest rate levels for finance lease liabilities related to paving and infra projects business operations. the
components of discount factor are weighted according to average target capital structure of the sector. pre-tax wacc is
determined separately for each tested unit. in the calculation of the segment-specific discount rates in 2015, the company
used country-specific discount rates that were weighted with country-specific operating capital.

sensitivity analysis

in connection with the impairment tests, sensitivity analyses are made to determine how possible changes in key assumptions
of the unit-specific impairment tests would affect the results of those tests. the key assumptions affecting the present value
of cash flows are the development of market and competitive conditions, and the discount factor. in the sensitivity analyses the
calculation variables affecting these assumptions are varied and the effects of the changes on the margin between the carrying
value and present value of the cash flows are examined.

sensitivity analysis prepared in 2015 shows that reasonable and ordinary variation to key assumptions used in the testing would
not cause a need for impairment in paving, infra projects nor russian operations segments. the most significant risk for
impairment of goodwill arises from the building construction, finland -operating segment where the unit’s recoverable cash
flow exceeds the unit’s carrying amount by eur 37.1 million.

available-for-sale financial assets include several different unquoted shares out of which majority are real estate shares. the
value of one individual investment is not significant in relation to the total of all other investments. the fair value of unquoted
shares could not be reliably determined, thus they are presented at cost less possible impairments.

fair value measurement
other non-current receivables include trade receivables and other interest-free receivables. fair values are based on future cash
flows discounted using risk free market yields plus appropriate credit spreads. the used discount rates vary between 3.1–20.7
per cent (3.6–19.3). the carrying amount of current trade and other receivables is equal to their fair value due to their short
maturity.

the most significant part of the non-current financial liabilities is a eur 100 million senior bond, the fair value of which is
based on the market price at the reporting date. the carrying amount of current financial liabilities is assumed to be close to
their fair value due to their short maturity.

a fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value
the group has categorised financial instruments recognised at fair value by using a three-level fair value hierarchy. financial
instruments within level 1 of the hierarchy are traded in active markets hence prices are obtained directly from the efficient
markets. fair values of instruments within level 2 are based on observable market inputs and generally accepted valuation
methods. fair values within level 3 are not based on observable market data but on quotations provided by brokers and market
valuation reports.

29 pension obligations
the company has in its operating countries several defined contribution pension plans which are subject to local regulation and
practices. the company’s one most significant pension plan is the finnish employees pensions act (tyel), in which the
benefits are determined directly on the basis of the level of the beneficiary’s earnings level. tyel pension plan is mainly arranged
through pension insurance companies and it is treated as a defined contribution plan.

at the end of 2015, the company had defined benefit pension plans only in finland. the plans at the year-end 2015 were final
salary defined benefit plans, and they supplement the statutory pensions or enable retirement before the statutory retirement
age. the company’s last two defined benefit pension plans in norway were terminated during 2015.

30 share based payments
performance-based reward
years 2013–2015

at the end of 2012, the board of directors of lemminkäinen corporation decided on a new share-based incentive plan for the
group’s key personnel. the plan included three one-year earning periods, calendar years 2013, 2014 and 2015. the company’s
board of directors decided on the earning criteria and the set targets at the beginning of each earning period. the potential
performance-based reward for an earning period will be paid out in company shares and cash. the proportion to be paid in cash
will cover the taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward. the shares may not be transferred during the commitment
period of approximately two years. if a key person’s employment or service contract ends during the commitment period, they
will generally have to return any reward shares to the company without compensation.

conditional reward

as part of the plan the above mentioned key personnel has the opportunity to receive conditional reward, i.e. matching shares,
on the basis of their share ownership and continued employment or service contract. in order to receive the conditional reward, a
key person must already own or acquire a specified number of company shares, or a percentage thereof. the number and date
are set by the board of directors. in this case, the key person will be granted, as a reward, one share for each share acquired, as
long as their employment or service contract remains valid and they retain ownership of these shares until the conditional
reward is paid. the earning period for the conditional reward was the calendar years 2013–2015.

warranty provisions cover after completion repair costs arising from warranty obligations. provisions related to housing
construction are expected to be used within one year after the provision is made. warranty provisions related to other
construction projects are mainly used in 1–2 years after the provision is made.

10 year liability provision related to housing and commercial construction is determined as a whole for all the projects including
such liabilities.

environmental provisions are mainly related to a site's landscaping obligations. the expected time for using landscaping
provisions depends on the use of the site, because in most cases the landscaping work starts after the use of the site ceases. in
addition, environmental provisions cover other provisions related to environmental obligations.

lease liability commitment arises, when the company has a contractual obligation to obtain tenants for premises not yet leased
in a commercial real estate under construction. provisions for lease commitments are expected to be used in 1–3 years after the
provision is made.

litigation provision is recognised for the asphalt cartel related claims for damages pending in the district court of helsinki, with
21 municipalities as plaintiffs. the court proceedings of these actions are expected to start in the district court during 2016 at
the earliest, and are expected to last 1–3 years. the amount of provision is estimated on the basis of the decisions given by
helsinki district court on 28th november 2013.

33 financial risk management
in its business operations, lemminkäinen group is exposed to financial risks, mainly funding, liquidity, foreign exchange rate,
interest rate and credit risks. the aim of the group's financial risk management is to reduce uncertainty concerning the possible
impacts that changes in fair values on the financial markets could have on the group's result, cash flow and value. the
management of financial risks is based on principles of the treasury policy approved by the board of directors. the treasury
policy defines the principles and division of responsibilities with regard to financial activities and the management of financial
risk. the policy is reviewed and if necessary updated at least annually.

execution of the treasury policy is the responsibility of the group treasury, which is mainly responsible for the management of
financial risks and handles the group's treasury activities on a centralised basis. the group's treasury policy defines the division
of responsibilities between the group treasury and business units in each subarea. the group companies are responsible for
providing the group treasury with up-to-date and accurate information on treasury-related matters concerning their business
operations. the group treasury serves as an internal bank and co-ordinates, directs and supports the group companies in
treasury matters such that the group's financial needs are met and its financial risks are managed effectively in line with the
treasury policy.

funding and liquidity risk
the group seeks to ensure the availability of funding, optimise the use of liquid assets in funding its business operations and to
minimise interest and other finance costs. the group treasury is responsible for managing the group's overall liquidity and
ensuring that adequate credit lines and a sufficient number of different funding sources are available. it also ensures that the
maturity profile of the group's loans and credit facilities is spread sufficiently evenly over coming years as set out in the treasury
policy. the maturity schedule of the interest-bearing liabilities, as per the group’s accounting, is front-loaded. the reason for
this is the eur 104.1 million (127.1) borrowings of companies included in inventory, which are recorded in current interest-
bearing liabilities. these liabilities mainly consist of non-current loans of housing companies, which are under construction or
completed, and these borrowings will be transferred to the buyers of the co-op shares when the units are handed over.
regarding unsold housing units, the group will bear the liability by paying financial consideration for the units in question during
a long loan period.

according to the treasury policy, the group's liquidity reserve shall at all times match the group's total liquidity requirement.
due to the nature of the group's business operations, seasonal borrowing is of great importance. the group's liquidity
management is based on cash flow forecasting.

foreign exchange rate risk
the aim of foreign exchange rate risk management is to reduce uncertainty concerning the possible impacts that changes in
exchange rates could have on the future values of cash flows, business receivables and liabilities, and other items in the
statement of financial position. exchange rate risk mainly consists of translation risk and transaction risk.

translation risk consists of foreign exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the income statements and the
statement of financial position of foreign group companies into the group’s functional currency. translation risk recorded in
accounting is caused by equity investments in foreign entities and their retained earnings, the effects of which are recorded
under translation differences in shareholders’ equity. lemminkäinen group has foreign net investments in several currencies.
the key currencies in which the group was exposed to translation risk in 2015 were the russian rouble and the norwegian
krone. the change in translation differences in 2015 was eur -4.2 million (-18.6), of which eur -2.5 million (-15.8) was
attributable to the russian rouble and eur -1.6 million (-2.7) to the norwegian krone. reportable translation risk is also caused
by the reporting period’s income statement, the impact of which can be seen, among others, directly in the group’s reportable
net sales and operating profit in euros. in 2015, the impact of exchange rate changes (2015 actuals compared to 2015 actuals
recalculated with 2014 foreign exchange rates) on the group’s net sales was eur -67.2 million (-73.2), of which eur -45.6
million (-40.0) was attributable to the russian rouble and eur -17.1 million (-19.7) to the norwegian krone, and their impact
on the operating profit was eur -0.5 million (-5.0), of which eur -1.0 million (-4.3) was attributable to the russian rouble
and eur 0.3 million (-0.6) to the norwegian krone. in accordance with the treasury policy, lemminkäinen group protects itself
from translation risks primarily by keeping equity investments in foreign entities at an appropriately low level, and thus does not
use financial instruments to hedge the translation risks.

transaction risk consists of cash flows in foreign currencies from operational and financial activities. the group seeks to hedge
business currency risks primarily by operative means. the remaining transaction risk is hedged by using instruments such as
foreign currency loans and foreign currency derivatives. the group companies are responsible for identifying, reporting,
forecasting and hedging their transaction risk positions internally. the group treasury is responsible for hedging the group's risk
positions as external transactions in accordance with the treasury policy. the transaction risk positions of the group were
mainly due to sales and purchases within the next 12 months, and receivables and liabilities in the statement of financial
position.

the key currency pairs in which the group was exposed to transaction risk in 2015 and 2014 were eur/rub and eur/sek. in
2015 the group did not apply hedge accounting to transaction risk hedging.

sensitivity analysis of transaction risk
the following assumptions have been made when calculating the sensitivity caused by changes in exchange rates:

     the exchange rate change is assumed to be +/- 10%
     the position includes both external and intra-group financial assets and liabilities denominated in swedish kronas and
     russian roubles and derivatives hedging these items
     the position does not include forecasted future cash flows
     taxes are excluded in sensitivity analysis

interest rate risk
the aim of lemminkäinen group's interest rate risk management is to minimise changes affecting the result, cash flows and
value of the group due to interest rate fluctuations. the group treasury manages and monitors the interest rate position. the
group's interest rate risk primarily comprises fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings, interest-bearing financial assets and
interest rate derivatives. interest rate changes have an effect on items in the income statement and consolidated statement of
financial position.

the interest rate risk is managed by aligning the group's average period of interest fixing term with the interest rate sensitivity of
the business. the interest rate sensitivity position of the group's business is estimated to be about 15 months. in accordance
with treasury policy average interest rate fixing term and fixed/floating ratio of the debt protfolio is being followed.

the group can have both variable- and fixed-rate long-term borrowings. the ratio of fixed- and variable-rate borrowings can be
changed by using interest rate derivatives. the group has used interest rate swaps for managing interest rate risks. during 2014
a part of the interest rate swaps were used for hedge accounting and a hedging result of those derivatives have been recognised
in interest expenses in 2014. there was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from hedge accounting during the financial year
2014. hedging instruments assigned to hedge accounting have matured in 2014 and hedge accounting was terminated during
that reporting period.

interest rate fluctuations in 2015 did not have any unusual effect on the group's business, but a significant rise in the level of
interest rates may have a detrimental effect on the demand for housing.

sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk
the following assumptions are made when calculating the sensitivity caused by a change in the level of interest rates:

      the interest rate change is assumed to be 1 percentage point
      interest rate changes have been calculated for a 12 month period
      the position includes variable-rate financial liabilities, variable-rate financial assets (including cash and cash
      equivalents) and interest rate derivatives
      market interest rate is assumed to be positive at the start of the year for all other instruments except for interest rate
      derivatives
      all factors other than the change in interest rates remain constant
      taxes have not been taken into account when calculating sensitivity

commodity price risk
the group's paving operations are exposed to bitumen price risk. the price of bitumen is mainly determined by the world market
price of oil. the group protects itself against the bitumen price risk with price clauses in sales agreements, fixed purchase
prices, and derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied. group treasury regurarly follows the bitumen position of the
group.

credit risk
credit risks arise when a counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligations, casusing the other party to suffer a financial
loss. lemminkäinen has defined a credit policy for customer receivables that aims to boost profitable sales by identifying credit
risks in advance and controlling them. the credit policy sets the minimum requirements concerning trade credit and collections
for lemminkäinen group. the group's credit control function defines credit risks and the business units are responsible for
managing them.

most of the group's business is based on established and trustworthy customer relationships and on contractual terms
generally observed in the industry. the group is exposed to credit risk mainly through the group's trade receivables and
receivables associated with deposits and receivables. the maximum amount of credit risk is the combined total values of the
aforementioned items as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position. the amounts and due dates of the
group's trade receivables are presented in the table below. the group does not have any significant credit risk concentrations as
trade receivables are distributed among many different customers in a number of market areas. the business unit that made the
contract actively monitors the receivables situation. if the business units renegotiate the terms of the receivables, they must do
so in accordance with the requirements of the group's credit policy. the risk of credit losses can be reduced by means of
guarantees, mainly bank guarantees and bank deposits. in addition, lemminkäinen uses factoring arrangements which also
mitigates the credit risk. lemminkäinen's credit losses have been minimal in relation to the scale of its operations. the main
risks are associated with business in russia. as a general rule, construction projects in russia are only undertaken against
receipt of advance payments. if, in exceptional situations, a credit risk is taken, the amount permitted is always proportional to
the expected margin on the project in question. receiveables transferred for legally enforceable collection are recognised as
credit losses.

the group is exposed to counterparty risk when investing liquid assets and using derivative instruments. liquid assets are
invested in short-term bank deposits, certificates of deposit issued by solvent partner banks, and commercial papers issued by
corporations with a good credit rating. the group treasury is responsible for the management of the group's counterparty and
credit risks related to cash, financial investments and financial transactions. the treasury policy specifies the approved
counterparties and their criteria. at the end of 2015, the counterparty risk was considered to be low.

management of capital and the capital structure
capital means the equity and interest-bearing liabilities shown on lemminkäinen's consolidated statement of financial
position. lemminkäinen group's capital management ensures cost-effectively that all of the group's business sectors maintain
their business viability at a competitive level in all cyclical conditions, that risk-carrying capacity is adequate, for example, in
construction contracts, and that the company is able to service its borrowings and pay a good dividend.

the amount of the group's interest-bearing liabilities is affected by factors such as scale of operations and cash flow, seasonal
changes in production, acquisitions, investments in or the sale of production equipment, buildings and land, and possible equity
related arrangements. the company continuously monitors especially the amount of debt, the ratio of net debt to ebitda, and
the equity ratio. the company also follows the development of equity by means of the return on capital employed.
lemminkäinen has determined its financial targets to be among others roce above 15% in 2019, equity ratio above 35%
during 2016-2019, and in addition, lemminkäinen aims at a stable distribution of dividends, with at least 40 per cent of the
profit for the financial year distributed to the shareholders.

the group may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity
securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the amounts involved may be material. the
group may decide to hold, cancel or sell such repurchased debt. possible subsequent sales of repurchased debt may be made
against cash or other compensation or in exchange for equity securities and such sales may be executed as open market offers,
privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. repurchases or exchanges of outstanding debt or subsequent sales or exchanges
of repurchased debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and

the group has eur 185 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes two financial covenants, the ratio
of net debt to ebitda and the equity ratio, which are monitored quarterly and calculated as an average of four previous
quarters. at the end of the year, the company met its covenants. in may 2014, the company agreed due to a covenant breach
with the providers of eur 185 million revolving credit facility that lemminkäinen shall strengthen its statement of financial
position by a total of eur 100 million by 30 september 2015. as part of the financing negotiations, the company also agreed
not to distribute dividends for the financial year 2014. in march 2015 the company agreed with the lenders that lemminkäinen
will commit to strengthen its statement of financial position by a total of eur 60 million instead of the previous eur 100
million. this requirement was fulfilled in the third quarter 2015. furthermore, the company may distribute a maximum of 40 per
cent of the group’s net profit for the financial years 2015 and 2016 as dividends without a preapproval of the lenders.

during the reporting period company repurchased notes to a nominal amount of eur 27.1 million of its eur 70 million hybrid
bond which were issued in 2012. during the comparison period the company executed several actions to strengthen its balance
sheet and financial position. in march 2014 the company issued a eur 70 million hybrid bond, and in june 2014 the company
issued a eur 100 million unsecured senior five-year bond. in october 2014 the company repaid its eur 60 million bond. in
addition, during the year 2014 the company conducted a rights offering. with the offering, the company raised gross proceeds
of eur 29.3 million (net proceeds of eur 27.3 million). the company also divested its technical building services business for
eur 55.4 million in 2014.

the group's equity includes two with original nominal value eur 70 million hybrid bonds with no maturity date. the first of
these was issued in march 2012 and as of 31.12.2015 eur 42.9 million was outstanding (70.0). the second hybrid bond was
issued in march 2014 and as of 31.12.2015 eur 70.0 million was outstanding (70.0). these hybrid bonds are classified as
equity instrument but the bond holders do not have any rights of a shareholders, and the bond does not dilute shareholders'
ownership in the company. the hybrid bonds are unsecured and junior to all other borrowings of the company. the bond have no
maturity date but company has the right to redeem them at it's own discretion after four years of the issuance date. the annual
coupon rate until the first redemption date of the bond issued in 2012 is 10% and the annual coupon rate of the bond issued in
2014 is 8.75% .

the eur 100 million unsecured senior five-year bond carries a fixed annual coupon at the rate of 7.375 per cent payable semi-
annually. the terms and conditions of the bond include two financial incurrence-based covenants: an equity ratio and net debt
to ebitda. if the equity ratio covenant is not met, the company is restricted from making certain payments, including
repurchases of its own shares and redemption of hybrid bonds. if the net debt to ebitda covenant is not met, the company is
restricted in its ability to raise additional debt.

the fair value of derivative instruments is the gain or loss arising from the settlement of the contract at the market price
prevailing on the reporting date.

hedge accounting has not been applied to all derivative instruments. nevertheless, these derivative instruments have been
utilised for hedging purposes. the derivatives are used in order to reduce business risks, interest rate risks and to hedge balance-
sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. changes in the fair value of non-hedge accounted derivatives are recognised
through profit or loss in accordance with their nature either in financial items or as other operating income and expenses.

financial derivatives are subject to master netting- or similar arrangements which are enforceable in some circumstances.
according to these arrangements above mentioned derivative assets and derivative liabilities could be settled on a net basis.
netting arrangements are enforceable according to typical negligence events or other events of default as the general terms for
derivative transactions applies. items, to which settlement on a net basis could be applied under certain conditions, are
recognised on gross basis in the statement of financial position. gross figures would have been eur 0.5 million (1.4) smaller
than the figures presented in the table.

litigation
on 28 november 2013, the district court of helsinki issued its decisions concerning damages related to the asphalt cartel. in
line with the decisions, lemminkäinen recorded approximately eur 66 million in expenses in its 2013 result. of this,
approximately eur 60 million consisted of damages ordered only to lemminkäinen, lemminkäinen’s share of the damages
ordered to it and other asphalt industry companies to be paid jointly and severally, as well as interest and legal expenses related
to the damages. this amount was paid by the company in january 2014. lemminkäinen has appealed against all 35 decisions,
where the plaintiffs’ claims were upheld partly, to the helsinki court of appeal. in lemminkäinen’s opinion, there are some
judicial aspects in the decisions, where the conclusions of the district court differ from previous legal practices. such judicial
aspects are related to the questions of prescriptions and value added tax, for example. the main oral hearing in the court of
appeal will take place during 2015. the finnish state and 22 municipalities have also submitted their appeals to the helsinki
court of appeal. the main oral hearing at the helsinki court of appeal took place on 2 march 2015–1 october 2015, and on the
basis of the helsinki court of appeal’s preliminary announcement, decisions are expected during 2016. in addition to the claims
decided on by the district court in november 2013, 21 claims against lemminkäinen and other asphalt industry companies for
damages are waiting for the main proceeding to begin. these damages amount to a total of approximately eur 26 million and
the company has made a eur 13 million provision for them.

in addition, the company has other individual legal proceedings related to business operations, the outcome of which is
uncertain. the company estimates that these legal proceedings will not have a material impact on the company’s financial
position.

short-term employee benefits

short-term employee benefits include fixed basic salary which is determined by the requirements of the position as well as the
performance and experience of the person holding the position. in addition, short-term employee benefits include the use of a
car benefit, mobile phone benefit, meal benefit and an extended insurance cover for accidents and travel in their leisure time.

the amount of the management's performance-related reward is earned by exceeding financial and operational profit targets
specified at the beginning of the year. lemminkäinen's top management is divided into two performance-related reward groups
which define the maximum performance-related reward percentage for each person. defining a person's reward group is based
on organisation level as well as the requirements and operational influence of the position. in 2015 the level of performance-
related reward of the management was based on profit before taxes, the group's return on capital employed as well as efficiency
and reaching goals related other development targets. performance-related rewards of the executive vice presidents of
business segments, who are members of the group's executive team, were also based on the operating profit of each segment.
achieving targets set on performance-related rewards were assessed semi-annually. the maximum performance bonus payable
to the president and ceo was 80 per cent of the annual salary and 60 per cent for other members of the group executive team.

lemminkäinen corporation’s general meeting elects each year the members to serve on the company’s board of directors and
decides on their fees. the fees are paid fully in cash. the term of office of the board members lasts until the end of the first
annual general meeting held after their election. the members of lemminkäinen’s board of directors do not belong to the
share-based incentive plan, and they are not employees of lemminkäinen. the 2015 annual general meeting decided that the
chairman would be paid a fee of eur 10,000 per month (10,000) and the board members would each receive a fee of eur
3,000 per month (3,000). the board members also receive an attendance fee of eur 500 per meeting (500). the chairman
of the audit committee is paid an attendance fee of eur 1,000 (1,000) and the members of the audit committee eur 500
(500) for each meeting of the committee. board members living outside finland receive an extra eur 1,000 (1,000) to their
attendance fees.

post-employment benefits

the additional pension plan of the president and ceo and the members of executive team is based on cash basis and earning a
paid-up policy. the amount of payment is defined as percentage of the annual salary. the president and ceo and other
members of the executive team are entitled to retire at the age of 63. the amount of the president and ceo’s and other
members' of the executive team defined contribution pension benefit equals 20 per cent of their annual fixed salary.

other long term benefits

a performance bonus agreement has been made for the president and ceo and the executive team for 2016–2018. the aim of
the bonus agreement is to ensure long term continuity and profitability of the business. the possible bonus will be paid in 2016
and 2018, and it is equivalent to a maximum of 15 months’ cash salary. the bonus criteria include, among other things, the
success of the group’s financing arrangements as planned.

other long term benefits expenses arose from service year awards and anniversary gifts to related-party personnel. the awards
and gifts comply with the group’s hr practices.

share-based payments

the share-based incentive plan for the group's key personnel comprises of performance-based and conditional rewards.

performance based reward comprised of three earning periods, which were calendar years 2013, 2014 and 2015. the
company's board of directors decided on the earning criteria and the set targets at the beginning of each period. performance
based compensation targets for 2015 were related to the company’s return on capital employed and equity ratio.

in addition to the performance-based reward, the key personnel also have the opportunity to receive a conditional reward based
on share ownership and a continuation of their employment or service contract. the conditional reward seeks to encourage the
group’s key personnel to increase their holding in the company. the earning period for the conditional reward was the calendar
years 2013–2015.

share-based payments are described in more detail in the note 30.
