joint message from the chairman of the
board of directors and the chairman of
the executive committee



the economic and financial context continued to be very demanding in 2013 at the global level and in
particular at the national level, treating the subsistence of many families as well as the balanced and
sustainable development of companies, with direct impact on the activity and profitability of the financial
sector.

during the year, despite the focus on strengthening the balance sheet, more rigorous risk management
and guaranteeing the solvency and future viability of the bank, bcp group sought to pursue dynamic
strategies, adjusted to the new challenges imposed by various interested parties in the different
geographies where the bank operates.

the main objective of the sustainability policies adopted by the bank, fostering a culture of social
responsibility, has been to positively influence the bank's long term value proposition, balancing the
wellbeing of the people and the communities where it is present with the preservation of the environment.

the bank developed numerous socially-directed actions, among which the following deserve particular
emphasis: : i) the work of the millennium bcp foundation, which strengthened the national nature of its
support, continuing to focus on initiatives in the area of culture that helped showcase the bank's own
heritage; ii) the “more mozambique for me” programme which included an integrated and coherent set of
initiatives in support of areas of intervention as diverse as health, education, school sports and civil society
through community development; and           iii) the microcredit operation in   portugal, which continues to
support and award entrepreneurs with viable projects, supporting 201 transactions and helping create 519
jobs in 2013, despite the recession in portugal an d the high rate of unemployment.

for products nad services, particularly in portugal, the bank continued to support customers with financial
difficulties through its advisory service and by promoting solutions appropriate to customer capacity to
repay, to avoid default.

we also looked to sustain and develop the economies where we operate by lending to small and medium-
sized companies, and through dynamic, subsidized credit lines with protocols for a wide range of business
sectors.

the involvement of employees at all operations of the bank in community action with the aim of improving
living conditions was a constant. in portugal, there was a deepening of the relationship with the food
bank, reflected in a rise in volunteer participation at the national level.

                                                                              2013 sustainability report    6

essential, and the bank developed a set of activities designed to improve knowledge of financial concepts,
promoting inclusion and appropriate financial practices, to help generate more sustainable social
development.

introduction
millennium bcp has published a sustainability reports every year in a structured and systematic manner
since 2004 (the social responsibility report in 2004).

in 2009, millennium bcp decided to include a brief chapter in volume i of the annual report on the
sustainability-related activities carried out by the bank and to publish the full version of the sustainability
report only in digital format.

in 2010, in a further alignment of sustainable development policies and social responsibility with the
business strategy of millennium bcp, this report became part of the annual report. the document
“progress and targets” was also published, describing the development of the actions set out in the
sustainability master plan. this reporting method adopted in 2010 continued to be used in 2011 and 2012.

in 2013, millennium bcp decided to include a chapter - responsible business - on sustainability in the
bank's annual report and to publish in a separate volume a document detailing the activities developed
during the year for the group bcp. this report - sustainability 2013 - is only available in digital format. this
document, with an international scope, aims to meet the expectations bcp group’s stakeholders via the
regular materiality tests and the ongoing feedback through normal communication channels.

this report was compiled in accordance with the principles set forth by the global reporting initiative 3.1
(gri), for level a+ and the respective supplement of the financial sector, the principles of inclusivity,
materiality and responsiveness of the ruling aa1000aps (2008) and verified by an external entity in
compliance with the principles defined in the international standard on assurance engagements 3000.

the methods used to estimate the indicators and reporting limits are detailed at the end of the report in the
methodological note. additional information, the gri indicators table and the compliance with the global
compact principles, can be consulted at www.millenniumbcp.en, sustainability area.

relation with stakeholders
to identify and be able to meet the expectations of its stakeholders, millennium bcp keeps a close and
transparent relation with all interested parties, based on an ongoing and straightforward dialogue
established through its several communication channels.

identification and integration of
expectations
the strategy of millennium bcp in the wake of sustainability is translated in the sustainability plan (sp), a
plan of commitments that aggregates a number of actions to be carried out by the bank. the definition of
the actions part of the sp is based on a balanced relation between the identified material issues, the
bank's available resources and the economic and market framework existing at the time.

in 2009 the bank defined in the first sp of the bank for the triennial 2010 – 2012, a first set of actions that
were carried out until the end of 2013. in 2013 the bank made and defined a new sp for the two year
period 2014 – 2015. the material issues identification process included: consultation and analysis of
studies - financial sector trends -; more relevant and frequent issues – analysts (esg) -; pds millennium
bcp 2010 - 2012; consultation to the most important divisions, consultation to employees.

materiality matrix
the identification and follow-up of the issues deemed material by the stakeholders of millennium bcp, led
to the identification of strong points and improvement opportunities in the bank's activity, helping the bank
to determine its strategy in the wake of sustainability, translated, formally, in the sustainability plan.




the sustainability plan 2014 - 2015, herein presented intends to face the main expectations identified
during the regular surveys made to the bank's main stakeholders.

motivation and satisfaction
the employees are one of the strategic pillars of bcp group. for this reason it is essential for the bank's
dynamics and sustainability, to use an annual survey to check the levels of: i) global satisfaction; ii)
satisfaction with the organic unit; iii) satisfaction with the direct manager; and iv) motivation.

registering a slight fall in the global participation, less 3 i.p. (index points) compared with 2012, the survey
taken in the beginning of 2013 recorded a participation of 81% of the employees. the decrease resulted
from a smaller participation in portugal, poland and romania. the results attained, in global satisfaction –
71.7 i.p. - a decrease that, although not significant, was mainly the result of the figures from romania and
mozambique. in portugal, the figures remained aligned with those of previous years. satisfaction with the
organic unit did not show any significant deviation, presenting a global value of 76.4 i.p. satisfaction with
the direct manager, 78.7 i.p., increased slightly, (1 i.p.), influenced by the majority of the operations.
motivation was the indicator that showed the most significant increase, reaching the highest value of the
last years: 73.3 i.p.. this value was particularly influenced by the employees in portugal who showed a
level of motivation of 80 i.p., a result that, if seen within the current economic and social context of the
country and of the bank, is particularly significant.

concerned management and an increase in the lowest remunerations, those earning between 800 and
1,200 euros per month. around 4.5% of the bank's employees benefited from this wage review.

innovation
bcp group continues to focus on ongoing improvement, believing in the significant value generated by
innovation processes, stimulating creativity and the sharing of experiences by all employees.

the internal programmes for the generation of ideas – mil ideias (a thousand ideas) -, in portugal, - call 2
action -, in poland and the recent programme – ideias que contam (ideas that matter) - in mozambique
are based on the recognition that the employees are a creative force able of generating ideas of value,
representing a means to value and boost their individual abilities through direct participation by presenting
an idea and indirect through comments or votes. these programmes enable improvements in internal
processes of the organization and increase the value of the offer of products and services to customers.

ethics and professional conduct
at bcp group respect for the bank's mission and values and also compliance with its strategy all depend
on each employee. therefore the bank fosters a culture of rigour and responsibility, based on permanent
information disclosure, training and monitoring mechanisms, to ensure strict compliance with the
established rules of conduct.

compliance office
the compliance office's mission is to ensure that all management bodies, the functional structures and all
the group’s employees comply with the legislation, rules and requirements (internal and external) that
guide the activities carried out by the bank and its subsidiary companies in order to avoid the risk of the
institution incurring in legal or regulatory sanctions, financial losses or negative effects in terms of
reputation, resulting from non-compliance with the laws, codes of conduct and good business practices
and duties that bind the company.

in 2013, within the scope of the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing, the optimization
of the software for the monitoring of entities and transactions (actimize) helped improve the quality of the
instruments used to prevent this risk, widening the scope for the type of transactions detected, enabling
the decentralization of the first line of transaction monitoring into the business and operational lines, thus
increasing employee involvement in the money laundering and terrorism financing prevention process.
the teams of the compliance office trained the commercial staff to provide them with the necessary skills
to deal with complex oversight processes, namely those presenting non-neglect able risks, in order to

ensuring employee compliance requires the implementation and adaptation of the processes in force in
the group to all the regulatory alterations, as well as training and the ongoing flow of information on
relevant issues. in addition to training on money laundering and terrorism financing prevention issues, the
bank continued to provide employees, through the bank's intranet, with relevant information on how to
comply with the duties of integrity, honesty, solvency and financial integrity foreseen in the code of
conduct; any violation or non-compliance with those duties is sanctioned in accordance with the provisos
of the internal regulations.
in accordance with the regulations in effect, the bank gave the compliance office the function of
supervising and validating all content of advertising items, detached or included in advertising campaigns
of products and services commercialized by the group. the trend, already observed in 2012, of
compliance with the duties of information and transparency in the advertising of financial products and
services was consolidated by the marketing and communication departments and millennium bcp did not
have any administrative proceeding brought against it by the bank of portugal or the cmvm.

internal audit
the main mission of the audit department is to ensure before the bank's
stakeholders the efficiency and adequacy of the bank's internal control
system as a whole and also ensure the adequacy of the governance and risk
management processes used by the bank and by the group. the audit
programs include the assessment of behavioural issues, compliance with
legislation and with all the remaining rules and codes of conduct, the proper
use of the delegated competences and the respect for the performance
principles in force in what concerns the relations established with the
customers, internal and external.

throughout 2013, as an integral part of the execution of its activities plan, the
audit department also assessed the issues related with the management of
environmental and social practices resulting from or related to the object of each audit in particular.
regarding the the audits made to the business networks, a key point is mechanisms in place to prevent
money laundering and to detect such illicit practices. the prevention and mitigation of the risk of fraud as
well as the detection and investigation of fraud attempts or situations, internal or external, and the
execution and monitoring of any resulting disciplinary or judicial proceedings are also a priority in the
distribution of resources allocated to the audit department. the audit department made 84 preventive
control procedures that originated around 529 individual assessments of potentially anomalous situations.
all the claims, complaints or denounciation of situations that show socially inappropriate behaviours by the
employees, either among themselves or relating to customers, are also assessed and investigated and
originate disciplinary proceedings whenever justified.

the assessments carried out by the department and the irregular situations reported by other organic
units of the bank originated 241 preliminary investigation proceedings and 31 disciplinary proceedings
brought against employees of the bank in portugal. currently there are 16 proceedings underway. none of
the cases involved situations of corruption.

service quality
at millennium bcp the quality of service is ensured by the ongoing implementation of initiatives that
enhance rigour and control of execution, ensuring that the operational and business processes function in
an efficient and reliable manner, continuously monitored and improved, contributing to a progressive
increase of customer satisfaction.

in portugal, millennium bcp received the “consumer choice” award for the
2nd consecutive year. this award is attributed by consumerchoice –
centro de avaliação da satisfação do consumidor.

satisfaction surveys
in portugal, the bank implemented the “customer experience" model, an
innovative method where customers evaluate the experiences they had
with the bank, enabling the bank to immediately identify those with the
lowest satisfaction indexes and perform in a proactive and efficient manner in
order to understand why those ratings occur. in the mass market segment,
62% of the customers recommend the bank' services (promoters) and 19% presents an index of low
recommendation (detractors). for the prestige segment the numbers are similar, as 57% of the customers
promote the bank and 15% of the customers present an index of low recommendation. more than 85,000
people were contacted. in 2014, the model will be extended to more experiences: i) the contact

established by the company customers with their business managers; ii) the service provided by the
contact centre; and iii) the internet banking service.

the bank csi (customer satisfaction index) study, conducted by marktest for the financial sector,
highlighted the bank's position in the 2nd quarter in the indicators - “satisfaction with the competence
/professionalism of the employees at the counter", “satisfaction with the contacts established" and
"satisfaction with the branch's working hours”. in basef banca (a competition assessment study also
carried out by marktest), millennium bcp reached in 2013 the best ranking in recent years in the indicator
“satisfaction with the quality of service”.

the bank continued with the “mystery shopping” actions in the mass market branches, doubling the
number of visits compared with 2012.

20 studies/surveys were carried out to monitor customer satisfaction with the different direct channels
and business networks, namely: i) internet banking for individuals, ii) internet banking for companies, iii)
mobile banking, iv) contact centre, v) companies and large companies and vi) private banking. the
index of satisfaction with the remote channels increased compared with the previous year and, notably the
satisfaction with the contact centre (telephone service), which rose from 83 i.p. to 90 i.p. in the internet
banking service (individuals and companies) more than 90% of the customers replied that they are
satisfied or very satisfied. the mobile services continued aligned with the previous year, with 91% of the
customers satisfied or very satisfied.                         customers satisfaction

bank, the mobile service - telemillennium - notwithstanding the increase compared with 2012, only
ensures the satisfaction of 58% of the customers. on the other hand, the website – millennet – is the
channel that shows the highest satisfaction level, 86 i.p. in the prestige segment more than 90% of the
customers replied that they are satisfied or very satisfied with the telemillennium and millennet channels.

in angola, the focus continues to be the actions carried out by the “mystery shopping”, which visited
approximately 62% of the branches. the results, presented to the commercial departments (including
managers and sub-managers), enable the discussion of improvement opportunities and action plans.
there was also a study made of dormant (inactive) customers to understand how to increase their
involvement with the bank. more than 600 customers were included in the survey, which was
complemented with focus group meetings.                   internal customers satisfaction

microcredit
in portugal, millennnium bcp's microcredit continues to be recognised as an alternative funding source for
entrepreneurs, playing a fundamental role in the current portuguese context because it effectively fights
unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. in 2013, the strategic focus of millennium bcp's microcredit
continued to be a strong component of institutional disclosure, making the service more dynamic with local
entities, closer to socially excluded populations in a methodical and systematic way, by: i) holding
meetings, about 600, with institutions, municipalities, parishes and schools; and ii) participating in about
160 events to promote employment and entrepreneurship, highlighting microcredit's role as instrument to
fight unemployment and social exclusion.

 millennnium bcp's microcredit signed 34 protocols of cooperation for entrepreneurship, and the financial
intermediation protocol with the associação nacional de direito ao crédito (andc) was renewed, aiming
to provide a specific microcredit line.

to get closer to micro-entrepreneurs the bank opened a new microcredit centre in downtown lisbon,
ensuring better access and greater visibility. the bank once again awarded the realizar prize (2nd
edition) – a microcredit and entrepreneurship award that recognizes the entrepreneurial spirit, creativity,
innovation and energy of millennium bcp's micro entrepreneurs.

as a result of all the work carried out, millennium bcp microcredit financed 215 new operations, with a total
credit granted amounting to 2.5 million euros, helping create 536 jobs. the credit volume granted to the
967 operations in the portfolio on 31 december 2013 was of 10.1 million euros, with outstanding principal

and the local health authority.

bcp group provides a workplace that enables its employees to undertake their activities with minimum
risk and maximum productivity. to guarantee these conditions, the premises are regularly monitored, there
are occupational safety and health (hst) visits to the premises, to find and correct problems. in 2013,
more than 370 visits were made in the group.

                                                                                                     2013 sustainability report              36




in romania, the occupational safety and health committee, composed of 9 employees, decides on
various issues related to the employees' health and well being, analysing also proposals on the prevention
of work accidents, occupational illnesses and introducing improvements in work conditions.

credit
millennium's employees have the possibility of obtaining credit for the acquisition of a permanent
residence under special conditions. the credit is granted abiding by the credit risk assessment principles
set by the bank's regulations. employees may also benefit from loans for social purposes that, among
others, serve to meet credit needs for education or health expenses, repairs made in their own home or in
a rented one and the acquisition of other goods and services of an exceptional nature.

in portugal, employees with term contracts do not have access to the specific conditions of the credit lines
for the acquisition of a permanent residence or to loans for social purposes. part-time employees have
access to the benefits common to all, but whenever those benefits are related to the number of working
years, the value of the benefit is computed based on effective work time.

support for education
bcp group continued to promote academic qualification, providing financial support to employees who, by
their own initiative, wish to get undergraduate degrees, post-graduate degrees or executive training
equivalent to a post-graduate degree or a masters degree, which is relevant for their careers and the
group. in 2013 over 2,000 employees received this support, borne by the bank, of more that 60% of the
expenses. the bank also continued to provide foreign language courses, mostly english.

in portugal, in terms of education and through monthly subsidies, the bank also supports: i) employees
who qualify as student-employee, granting a total of 16,333 euros, to 96 employees; ii) employees with
children of school age, supporting 5,329 employees, totalling 1.75 million euros; and iii) children of
deceased employees of school age, supporting 159 children and young people with 324,756 euros.

culture and leisure
in portugal and in mozambique, all millennium employees have access to various benefits through the
millennium bcp club and the millevantagens programme, respectively, by means of business partnerships
for advantageous conditions in several areas: health and wellbeing, education, culture and leisure, travel
and transportation, hotels, clothing and telecommunications. it is anticipated that in 2014 will be also
released a similar project in angola.

in portugal, employees and/or family members who become members of the millennium bcp club have
available a set of cultural, leisure and sports activities to enjoy in their free time. in 2013, over 290 events
were held that had 11,560 participants. in terms of training, 15 courses were held with a total of 290
participants. with the money collected at the entrance of the christmas celebration, a donation of 11,500
euros was given to the centro social e paroquial de nossa senhora da vitória, in oporto. including active
and retired employees and their family members, the millennium bcp club currently has over 37,000
members.

the employees who work at tagus park have available a free daily bus service for travelling to and from
lisbon.

in portugal and poland, certain supply contracts
define sustainability commitments, namely related to labour practices. presently, in portugal, 465
suppliers subscribe to these commitments, 80% of which are subject to continuous monitoring.

as part of the evaluation, millennium bcp's suppliers are subject to a permanent process, based on: i) the
relationship they maintain with technical competence centres; ii) performance assessment actions and
on the identification of improvements; and iii) existing decision-making processes to execute investments
and renew contracts.

the bank has tools and methodologies that enable it to check and make payments to suppliers within the
terms defined in the contracts, 30 days in most countries.

environmental responsibility
bcp group, aware of its environmental impacts, continued its effort to minimise its ecological footprint by
promoting the best practices in reducing electricity use, greenhouse gas emissions and consumption of
natural resources.



 in portugal, within environmental commitment, millennium bcp defined goals for reducing ecological
 footprint for 2014, 3% for paper and cardboard, 4% for water consumption, 11% for electricity
 consumption and 3% for co2 emissions.

based on a continuous improvement rationale, the bank is the path to eco efficiency, and investing in two
large areas:

 optimisation of processes and equipments – investments to improve the bank's processes and its
equipment and infra-structure.

 environmental awareness – involving employees and customers in the adoption of more responsible
environmental practices.

optimisation of processes and equipments
to produce more and better with less, millennium invests in the continuous optimisation of its processes
and activities and in the renewal of its equipment and infra-structure. all actions are carried out based on
rigorous cost-benefit analysis and have as fundamental premise maintaining the quality of the service
provided and increasing the satisfaction of the bank's customers. by investing a large part of resources
available to minimise environmental impacts, optimising processes and improving equipments and infra-
structures, the bank saves water, materials and energy and subsequently has less greenhouse gas
emissions.

portugal
in portugal, in 2013 and similarly to the work being carried out in previous years, several measures were
put in place to reduce the bank's electricity use and increase energy efficiency, achieving significant
average monthly reductions of consumption.

all energy efficiency measures in place allowed estimated savings of around 2,600 mwh corresponding to
  implemented measures                                                                   monthly reduction

an estimated reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 778 tco2eq.

at tagus park and at 53 branches, the bank started a diagnosis, which will take place over 24 months, of
energy consumption of the infra-structure and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (hvac),
aiming to manage them more efficiently and reduce consumption.

as part of the efforts to reduce energy consumption, the policies in place regarding employee travel, as a
result of budget restraints, resulted in video and audio conferences becoming an everyday practice for
bank employees, registering an expressive increase (161%) in the number of employees who participated

                                                                           2013 sustainability report   40




in webex sessions, rising from 4,905 participants in 2012 to 12,794 in 2013. the collective transportation
of employees to tagus park, by bus, registered a 2% increase in demand in terms of average daily
number of passengers.

in 2013, the bank continued to strive to use less paper, with 53% of statements being sent by e-mail, a
12% increase compared with 2012. the bank also recorded an increase in online bank slips, which now
represent 91% of all bank slips issued. in the large majority of documents issued, both for customers and
employees and internal administrative processes (statements, bank slips, salary receipts, account opening
and mortgage loans documents), there was a clear preference for digital documentation, with around 84%
of documents being issued in soft copy.



programme “ser lean do (being lean od)” (operations division)

in 2013, millennium bcp strengthened the continuous improvement programme for procedures “being
lean od”, created in 2010 for the purpose of promoting operational excellence (optimising processes).
this helped spread a culture of continuous improvement (lean) amongst the bank's employees.
through an it application to support the management of the continuous improvement and of the work
methods based on: mapping procedures; work standardisation; root cause analysis and visual
management, the programme was able to identify around 1,400 opportunities to improve the quality of the
procedures and/or decrease related costs. presently, the being lean od programme involves around 800
employees and in 2013 it was broadened to include the financial operations department and the human
resources division.
in 2014 the lean academy was created with the goal of applying the lean methodology to other bank’s
divisions and to ensure the necessary support in the teams where this approach has already been
implemented. the academy consists of a team of permanent support and various implementation teams,
which will promote the optimization of processes in the areas, ensuring a strong support to the "lean
agents", employees who have the role of agents of change, in the dissemination of the lean spirit and in
the implementation of sustainability tools.
globally, the being lean od programme led to an estimated decrease of 1.6 million paper sheets in 2013
                         2
and helped release 130 m of physical space.




poland
bank millennium continued its effort to reduce energy consumption and minimise greenhouse gas
emissions, accomplishing several actions and good practices, namely:

 the continuous monitoring of energy consumption in branches continued through invoice control,
creating a ranking of branches according to energy consumption. whenever possible and economically
viable the bank applies the improvement recommendations issued by energy audits.

 within the scope of it equipment, besides replacing older computers for new ones with 33% less energy
consumption, the bank continued to invest in the verdiem project and in the computer cloud programme,
both launched in poland in 2012. project verdiem, through the technological installation that enables the
centralised management of it equipment, placing them on stand-by and off-mode in periods when they
are not being used, enabled a global decrease of energy consumption of around 40%. the computer
cloud, which consists in making the bank's data centres virtual, enables savings of up to 20% in the
energy consumption of these devices.

 regarding the vehicle fleet and following the programme for replacing older cars for new cars meeting
the euro 5 regulation, burning less fuel and with lower co2 emissions, in 2013 the bank was able to have
78% of its cars meet the euro 5 regulation.

in terms of water management and similarly to what is being done in terms of electricity, millennium bank
continuously monitors the water consumption of the branches by controlling invoices. the branches are
ranked according to consumption and those that have higher consumption are audited. whenever possible
and economically viable the bank applies the improvement recommendations resulting from the audits.

the decrease in the use of materials, especially paper, translated into several actions, namely:

41 2013   sustainability report




 creation of the “8 in 1” contract for a package of basic products for new customers. with this contract, a
new customer who purchases several services with the bank receives only one contract, instead of one
per product, thus reducing the consumption of paper, ink and toner cartridges.

 control, in a more detailed manner, of the distribution of materials for advertising campaigns within the
scope of the quantities required and necessary, for the purpose of decreasing the costs of these
campaigns as well as paper consumption.

in poland, the bank also aimed to decrease of paper and plastic use through a mechanism for controlling
the purchase of materials, in place since 2012.

other countries
in all the other countries where millennium operates, though less representative in terms of size and
consequently in terms of environmental impacts due to energy and natural resources consumption, there
are also concerns that are common to all, such as: energy consumption; paper consumption; employee
travel.

romania is shrinking its car fleet and decreasing the number of trips employees make. the bank also
established practices to reduce materials consumption such as re-using cardboard boxes and the
existence of specific software in printers to prevent the occurrence of undesired printing.

millennium bim in mozambique undertook efforts to cut down on hard copies, sending about 65% of
statements to customers by e-mail.

in angola, branches were fitted with timers that shut down the main energy-guzzling equipment in non-
working hours, thus contributing to save energy and costs.

environmental awareness
the employees' environmental awareness has been considered by millennium as strategic in decreasing
the bank's environmental impacts.

portugal
in portugal, employee awareness was raised to the importance of adopting a more responsible
environmental attitude through the continuous communication programme “green it”, in place since 2010,
with the goal of decreasing the bank's main consumptions with environmental impact and simultaneously
reducing costs. in 2013, as part of the communication plan, highlight also include, in addition to the regular
disclosure of environmental information to raise the employees' awareness on the website and in all the
newsletters “it’s our news”, the production and disclosure of the green it newsletter – “we all can make a
difference”, focusing the importance of the employees in the effort to cut down energy and resources
consumption. the programme "consumption dashboard" continued to be applied, enabling the control of
the number of print-outs made in all the bank's divisions and a campaign was launched on the it portal to
cut down 20% of the prints in the it division, achieving a 28% decrease.

poland
in poland, bank millennium took part, for the fourth consecutive year, in the world wide initiative “earth
hour”, shutting down advertising signs in branches and in buildings for one hour as a signal to the general
community on the impacts caused by man's actions. the equitrac programme, created in 2012 to control
and report on the number of print-outs ordered by the employees, continued to raise awareness to the
importance of decreasing paper usage.



customer awareness
in 2013, bank millennium launched an advertising campaign in the social media to promote customer
investment in energy efficiency projects, as part of the polseff programme. the programme, managed by
the european bank for reconstruction and development (ebrd), was created for the purpose of
supporting projects that promote energy efficiency.

                                                                                                          2013 sustainability report               42




environmental manual for customers and employees
an environmental manual was launched to raise customer and employee awareness for the importance of
decreasing the main environmental impacts of resources consumption. encompassing issues such as
recycling electronic devices, as well as the responsible use of resources such as water, energy and raw
materials, the manual is a practical tool to cut back on environmental impacts.

ecological footprint
millennium regularly monitors a set of environmental performance indicators that measure the level of eco-
efficiency of the bank against. the main resources consumption with environmental impact, namely:
water, energy, greenhouse gas emissions and materials.

in 2013, the main environmental impact consumption, when analyzed in total reduced, reflecting the
continuous bank’s effort to improve their eco-efficiency. however when we analyze the environmental
performance indicators expressing the bank's consumption per employee, there is a slight increase in
energy consumption, in materials and in greenhouse gas emissions. this increase is due to the overall
reduction of the number of employees of the millennium bcp between 2012 and 2013.

                                                                                                    (1)

43 2013    sustainability report




the consumption of indirect energy went down 9% compared with 2012. this significant decrease in
indirect energy consumption occurred mainly due to the 11% decrease verified in portugal in the
consumption of electricity, caused by the energy efficiency measures in place and by closing 70 branches
and two back office buildings. poland and romania also contributed to decreasing indirect energy use in
the bank, due to the decrease of electricity consumption by 2% and 20% respectively, compared with
2012. globally, the bank decreased electricity consumption by 11%.

in portugal, the co-generation central in tagus park decreased its energy production by 6% compared
with 2012, producing 16% of all the electricity used in portugal.

millennium's direct energy consumption corresponds to the energy the bank consumes through the fossil
fuels purchased, namely diesel, gasoline and natural gas. the bank's consumption of direct energy
dropped 2%, due to the 8% decrease in energy consumption in portugal. total direct energy use in
portugal represents around 57% of total consumption of this type of energy in the bank. the decrease
registered in portugal was caused by the decrease in consumption of all fossil fuels, especially natural gas
with a 4% decrease. the reductions registered in portugal in the consumption of direct energy are justified
by the decrease in the number of branches and back office buildings and by the decrease in the vehicle
fleet, especially cars with gasoline engines. also contributing to the reduction of the bank’s direct energy
consumption was the 6% reduction verified in angola in the diesel consumption for equipment, which
represents 21% of all direct energy consumed by millennium. the high diesel consumption for equipment
in angola results from the necessity to produce electric energy through generators due to the interruptions
of the supply on the part of the public grid.

greenhouse gas emissions
as part of the effort to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, millennium
computes and monitors its carbon footprint and takes part every year in the carbon disclosure project
(cdp), having already participated five times.

the bank's carbon footprint follows the decreasing trend recorded for the consumption of direct and
indirect energy, with total greenhouse gas emissions down 6% compared with 2012.

 scope 1 emissions result from the use of fossil fuels, namely: gasoline; diesel and natural gas (direct
energy) and leaks from hvac equipment. scope 1 emissions contributed 30% of all emissions from
millennium (24,681tco2eq), 2% less than in 2012, reflecting the 2% decrease recorded in the
consumption of direct energy.

 scope 2 emissions, totalling 55,691tco2eq, represent 69% of millennium's greenhouse gas emissions,
mainly caused by the consumption of indirect energy, the bank's energy consumption standard.
compared with 2012, emissions were down 8%, due to the 9% decrease in the use of indirect energy.
the emission reduction was less than the variation of indirect energy consumption, due to the worsening
of the emission factor associated to the purchase of electricity in portugal.

in terms of waste, millennium has agreements with entities specialised in collecting, transporting and
reusing the main types of waste materials, namely: paper and cardboard, plastic and ink and toner
cartridges. in line with the reduction recorded in the use of materials, waste production also decreased in
portugal and abroad, by 17% and 13% respectively. in portugal, the most significant decrease in waste
produced between 2012 and 2013 was in terms of paper and cardboard, due to the nationwide collection
of waste from the branches' archives for destruction in 2012, which increased significantly the amount of
paper and cardboard disposed of that year.

report are related to the comparison and analysis of the indicators' evolution.

in 2010 began the reporting of angola and switzerland operations, to the economic and social indicators,
and are not directly comparable with reported in the 2009 sustainability report.

in 2013 we proceeded to the recalculation of all environmental data presented in 2012, in order to include
the absolute values of angola and so enable comparability with the bank values reported in 2013. in 2013,
failed to report greece, operation however alienated. thus, much of the annual variations of the indicators
should be interpreted as and may be impacted by the greek operation output bcp group.

calculation criteria
social indicators
rotations

new hire rate = (number of new employees hired) / (total number of employees) *100

internal mobility rate = (number of employees in internal mobility processes) / (total number of employees)
*100

turnover rate = (number of employees that left the company) / (total number of employees) *100

absences
absenteeism rate = (total number of workdays with absences recorded) / (48*5*total number of
employees) *100

health
workplace injury rate = (number of employees that were injured while at work) / (total number of
employees) *100

48*5*total number of employees – maximum work potential in the organisation per year, wherein 48 represents the
number of work weeks and 5 represents the number of working days per week.

environmental indicators
energy
consumption of natural gas and liquid fuels – total estimated based on the purchase of these fuels.
the fhv (fuel heating value) of the fuels used to compute energy is based on the global reporting
initiative, available at www.globalreporting.org, and apa (portuguese agency for the environment),
available at www.apambiente.pt.
consumption of electricity – total estimated based on the electricity bills.


greenhouse gas emissions (ghg)
scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions (resulting from the consumption of direct energy) - the factors
for the emissions of liquid fuels and natural gas used were provided by the green house gas protocol
(ghg protocol), available to the public at www.ghgprotocol.org.
scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions (resulting from the consumption of indirect energy) - the
estimated values are based on the consumption of electricity and thermal energy by millennium bcp and
the national emissions factors were computed using the national energy mix. for portugal, the emissions
factors used were the ones made public by edp comercial, available at www.edp.pt.
for international operations, the bank used the emission factors of the 2009 green house gas protocol,
available at www.ghgprotocol.org, and the data for the 2011 national energy mix of the international
energy agency – statistics and balances of oecd and nonoecd countries, available to the public at
www.iea.org
scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (resulting from train and airplane travel and employee
commuting) - the emission factors for bus, train and plane travel used were provided by the green house
gas protocol (ghg protocol), available to the public at www.ghgprotocol.org.


water
the total consumption of water is estimated based on the analysis of the water meters and on the financial
data.


materials
consumption of paper and cardboard – total estimate based on the purchase of these materials and
numbers in stock records. the weight of the paper units were found using standard paper measurements
issued by the iso 216 standard.
plastic consumption - total estimate based on the purchase of these materials and numbers in stock
records. the calculation of the amount of plastic used in bank cards was based on the number of cards
issued for customers and on the standard weight of a card.
consumption of ink and toner cartridges – total estimated based on the purchase of these materials.
in portugal, the values reported include ink and toner cartridges used by the bank through xerox.


waste
paper and cardboard – the total amount produced is the sum of the quantity sent for recycling and an
estimated amount of waste produced from paper/cardboard consumption that is not usually meant for
archiving or for customers.
plastic - estimate of the amount of waste produced from water bottles and plastic office supplies, which
are not usually meant for archiving or for customers.
ink and toner cartridges – the bank considered that the total produced corresponds to consumption.
