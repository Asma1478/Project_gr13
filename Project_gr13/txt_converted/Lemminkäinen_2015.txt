                              lenders.
                              we secure our position as a reliable debtor by meeting payment obligations as agreed.

the following co₂ emissions coefficients have been used when calculating the emissions for these forms of energy:
light fuel oil 261 g/kwh; heavy fuel oil 284 g/kwh; natural gas 198 g/kwh, diesel 265 g/kwh and petroleum 265g/kwh (source: motiva).
* electricity, purchased 203 g/kwh (source: iea 5-year average 2007-2011).
the coefficient for purchased electricity is obtained annually from data published by the iea.
we have defined co₂ as the most significant greenhouse gas. these emissions are generated by both transportation and energy consumption in our own
operations.
scope 1 emissions cover the entire group’s energy consumption and all the vehicles and fuel cards that we own.
scope 2 covers the emissions generated during the production of electricity and district heating at our production facilities.
our scope 3 coverage is currently being defined.
in addition to co₂, we also cause environmental loading through, for example, noise, dust, vibration and odour pollution, and sox, nox and small particle
emissions.

transportation causes co₂, sox, and nox emissions as well as noise and dust pollution. co₂ emissions are reported as part of our en 16 indicator (scope 1).
our reporting covers our own vehicles’ fuel consumption in our domestic operations. traffic and transportation includes all vehicles used on public highways.
we reduce the environmental impact of traffic and transportation by paying attention to the optimisation and efficiency of transportation and by servicing our
vehicles regularly. we avoid idling, and we choose machinery and equipment that are appropriate for the intended use.
we take extra care to protect the ground on aprons, to prevent oils, fuels and solvents from contaminating the soil and groundwater.

business segments
changes in the reporting structure in 2014 and 2015
lemminkäinen changed its reporting structure on 1 august 2014 into three reporting segments: infrastructure construction;
building construction, finland; and russian operations. the former scandinavia business segment was integrated into the
infrastructure construction business segment. russian operations include both building construction and infrastructure
construction businesses.

at the beginning of 2015, the infrastructure construction business segment was divided into two: paving, mineral aggregates
and earthworks businesses were transferred to the new paving business segment. foundation engineering, civil engineering and
rock engineering constitute the new infra projects business segment. as of 1 january 2015, the reporting business segments
are: paving; infra projects; building construction, finland; and russian operations. building construction in sweden is reported
as part of the group’s other operations.

infrastructure construction
operating environment
in finland, infrastructure construction decreased due to weak development in building construction and cuts in road
maintenance appropriations in the state budget. underground infrastructure construction remained brisk, especially in urban
growth centres. in sweden, norway and denmark, road construction, including the renovation projects, maintained the demand
for paving in particular. in addition, the governments of these countries are investing in the infrastructure network development
and in road maintenance. in the baltic countries, the market situation in infrastructure construction was mainly stable. the mild
weather prolonged the paving season in all lemminkäinen’s operating countries.

in finland, the profitability was improved by major infra projects as well as paving and mineral aggregates businesses. in
norway, the result turned clearly positive through overhead reductions and by closing down unprofitable sites and business
operations, among other measures. the efficiency of paving project management and tendering process has also been
improved. the segments’ operating profit includes an approximately eur 3 million loss related to unreceived payments from the
company’s customer lappland gold miners that declared bankruptcy.

at the end of the year, the order book for infrastructure construction was lower than in 2013: eur 682.6 million (866.7), of
which 67% attributable to 2015. the most significant decline in the order book took place in rock engineering in finland and
sweden.

building construction, finland
operating environment
the market situation in building construction remained weak in 2014. construction was supported by renovation, which
remained stable. only some 25,000 (28,000) new residential units were started, and the number is not expected to increase in
2015. housing sales slowed down especially during the second half of the year as consumer demand was decreased by
economic uncertainty and longer sales times of old private houses. commercial construction was minimal, particularly outside
the helsinki metropolitan area. in 2015, the market situation in building construction is estimated to remain similar to 2014.

in january–december, net sales were eur 539.0 million (592.9) and operating profit was eur 9.3 million (5.0). the operating
profit includes asset write-downs worth eur 4.1 million (14.1). the operating profit, excluding non-recurring items, was eur
13.4 million (19.1). the segment’s result was improved by residential and commercial projects in the helsinki metropolitan area.
the profitability was impaired by slowdown of housing sales and failures in individual projects such as a declined margin of
approximately eur 4 million related to an old consortium.

housing sales slowed down during the second half of 2014 and the number of reservations cancelled was higher than before.
due to the declining markets in 2014, the number of residential development start-ups targeted at consumers was slightly
lower than in the previous year. the decrease in consumer demand was compensated by growing sales to investors. the number
of unsold completed residential units doubled, and was 336 (164) at the end of the year.

the order book of building construction, finland stood at eur 687.1 million (544.3), of which 58% attributable to 2015. the
order book was increased by major contracting projects such as the renovation of the parliament building and the sibelius

russian operations
operating environment
the economic uncertainty in russia and the radical weakening of the rouble in 2014 increased mortgage interest rates and
banks applied stricter loan terms in many locations. however, the economic and political uncertainty did not decrease consumer
demand for housing in the so-called comfort class, where a large proportion of housing transactions are financed by the
consumers themselves. housing sales were brisk especially during the fourth quarter of the year. in infrastructure construction,
several state-funded road renovation projects were started, especially on roads departing from moscow. the outlook for 2015
continues to be uncertain. the declining oil price is slowing down the country’s economic growth and, together with the limited
scope of the russian financial markets, is impairing the general construction market situation. the increase in mortgage
interest rates and the decreasing purchasing power of the middle class may reduce the demand for housing this year.

the net sales were eur 196.1 million (164.5) and the operating profit was eur 19.7 million (-0.3). the result includes a
eur 4.3 million write-down related to a residential development project completed in 2010. the operating profit, excluding
non-recurring items, was eur 24.0 million (-0.3). the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the euro-denominated net
sales was eur -40.0 million and on the operating profit eur -4.3 million compared to 2013. of the net sales, 48% came from
residential development projects, 25% from infrastructure construction and 27% from building construction contracting.

profitability for 2014 was improved by residential development projects, better margins in ongoing contracts and profitable road
and bridge special paving projects. housing sales picked up towards the end of the year and the apartment price level in roubles
rose. during the second half of the year, lemminkäinen completed two residential development and construction projects in st
petersburg, comprising altogether 545 residential units as well as some individual commercial properties and parking spaces.
of the completed projects, a total of 446 residential units had been sold and recognised as revenue at the end of the year. at
the end of the financial year, lemminkäinen had one residential development project (418 residential units) under construction,
with estimated completion at the end of 2015. the results for building construction contracting and infrastructure construction
developed favourably in 2014, but the company recorded approximately eur 1 million loss related to the termination of
technical building services. the capital tied up in russian operations at the end of period was eur 61.9 million (85.6).

the segment’s order book decreased clearly and stood at eur 86.4 million (322.2) at the end of the year. the order book was
decreased by the completion of two residential development projects and fewer contracting projects.

financials › consolidated financial statements › notes to the consolidated financial statements (ifrs) › 5 seasonality of business



5 seasonality of business
seasonality of certain operations of the company affects the amount and timing of the company’s profits. paving and mineral
aggregates working season takes place mostly in the second and third quarters of a year to which quarters most of the revenues
are recognised. weather conditions influence the lengths of the paving and mineral aggregates working seasons, which also
affects the amount and timing of the company’s profits. other infrastructure projects, e.g., rock engineering and earthworks, are
generally less seasonal in nature, but there is some seasonality in foundation engineering due to the timing of building
construction projects.

revenue from own building developments is recognised, for the sold proportion, on completion which causes seasonal
fluctuations to the company’s profit. the company seeks to offset this fluctuation by launching new own developed housing
projects evenly throughout the year in which case the projects will be completed and revenue from them is recognised as evenly
as possible throughout the year.

at the end of 2014, other capitalised expenditure included eur 9.5 million (eur 9.2 mill.) and advance payments eur 0.4
million (eur 5.5 mill.) capitalised computer software development costs.

the company recorded an impairment of eur 1.2 million to infrastructure construction segment’s intangible assets in 2014.
the impairment was recorded to a land use right located in sweden which was initially measured at fair value in connection to
an acquisition of a subsidiary. the fair value of the land use right has been measured based on its value in use.

goodwill
at the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected
to benefit from synergies arising from the business combination. the company’s business was organised into four operating
segments at the beginning of 2014 and later into three operating segments at the beginning august. in connection with the
reorganisation at the beginning of the year the company reallocated the goodwill previously subject to baltic rim region paving
and mineral aggregates operations (common to segment in the table) to country level. in addition, the goodwill decreased by
eur 25.2 million due to the divestment of the company technical building services business during 2014.

** the goodwill reported in the ”common to segment” column has arisen from the asphalt business acquisitions in denmark and norway. it is allocated to the
international operations' baltic rim region paving and mineral aggregates cash generating unit. this goodwill has been tested for impairment at the level of the
whole international operations' baltic rim region paving and mineral aggregates cash generating unit. in addition, the goodwill allocated to each business area has
been tested separately for each country.

goodwill impairment tests

goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there are indications of possible impairment. the tests are carried out
as value-in-use calculations of individual businesses in accordance with the smallest cash-generating unit principle. in
impairment testing the discounted present value of the recoverable cash flows of each cash-generating unit is compared with
the carrying amount of the unit in question. if the present value is lower than the carrying amount, the difference is recognised
through profit or loss as an expense in the current year.

the goodwill impairment tests carried out during the third quarter of 2014, showed that the present values of the future cash
flows exceed the carrying amounts in all business units. the company carried out a goodwill re-testing for finland’s building
construction at end of 2014. based on the tests, there was no need for impairment of goodwill in 2014.

forecasts and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing

cash generating units’ cash flow forecasts are prepared for a four year planning period based on management estimates based
on actual past performance. main assumptions used in the preparation of the cash flow forecasts are the growth of the market
in question, the company’s profitability development as well as measures which the company has committed to.

            comprehensive as the complete annual report, which is available at www.lemminkainen.com/annualreport2014

main assumptions in the goodwill impairment testing are long term growth and discount rate. cash flow forecasts beyond the
four year (five years in 2013) planning period are based on the assumption of 1 percent annual growth which was lower than
european central bank's target inflation rate over medium term in effect at the time of the impairment testing. weighted
average cost of capital (wacc), calculated for each individual unit, is used as the discount factor. wacc takes into account
risk-free interest rate, illiquidity premium, expected market rate of return, the industry’s beta value, country risk and the debt
interest rate including interest rate margin. these components are weighted according to average target capital structure of the
sector. pre-tax wacc is determined separately for each tested unit.

sensitivity analysis

in connection with the impairment tests, sensitivity analyses are made to determine how possible changes in key assumptions
of the unit-specific impairment tests would affect the results of those tests. the key assumptions affecting the present value
of cash flows are the development of market and competitive conditions, and the discount factor. in the sensitivity analyses the
calculation variables affecting these assumptions are varied and the effects of the changes on the margin between the carrying
value and present value of the cash flows are examined.

the majority of the company’s goodwill is subject to the infrastructure construction operating segment. sensitivity analysis
prepared in 2014 show that reasonable and ordinary variation to key assumptions used in the testing would not cause a need for
impairment in the infrastructure construction operating segment. neither does the goodwill subject to other nordic countries,
the baltics or the russia operations include a risk of impairment, according to the sensitivity analysis. the most significant risk
for impairment of goodwill arises from the building construction, finland -operating segment where the unit’s recoverable cash
flow exceeds the unit’s carrying amount by eur 0.0 million. the pronounced risk is a result of the weak general economic
situation in finland that appears in the demand for housing and commercial construction. sensitivity analysis show that an
increase in the discount rate or decrease in the long term annual growth rate would cause an impairment of goodwill in the
building construction, finland -operating segment.

figures describing the goodwill impairment risk of units subject to impairment testing by business segment are presented
below.

available-for-sale financial assets include several different unquoted shares. the value of one individual investment is not
significant in relation to the total of all other investments. the fair value of unquoted shares could not be reliably determined,
thus they are presented at cost less possible impairments. shares included in the financial assets available-for-sale are
itemised in note 11 under the heading other shares and holdings.

fair value measurement
other non-current receivables includes trade receivables and other interest-free receivables. fair values are based on future cash
flows discounted using risk free market yields plus appropriate credit spreads. the used discount rates vary between 3.6–19.3
per cent (0.6–4.8%). the carrying amount of current trade and other receivables is equal to their fair value due to their short
maturity.

the fair value of the bond included in non-current interest-bearing financial liabilities is based on the market price and the fair
value of other non-current financial liabilities is based on future cash flows discounted using a market yield plus appropriate
credit spread for the group at the reporting date. the used discount rates vary between and 2.2–4.8 per cent (2.3–3.2%). the
carrying amount of current financial liabilities is assumed to be close to their fair value due to their short maturity.

a fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value
the group has categorised financial instruments recognised at fair value by using a three-level fair value hierarchy. financial
instruments within level 1 of the hierarchy are traded in active markets hence prices are obtained directly from the efficient
markets. fair values of instruments within level 2 are based on observable market inputs and generally accepted valuation
methods. fair values within level 3 are not based on observable market data but on quotations provided by brokers and market
valuation reports.

derivatives eur -0.1 milllion before deferred taxes has been removed from the hedging reserve into the income statement (in

and loss during the financial year arising from cash flow hedging.

capital on the basis of a separate decision. the company arranged a rights offering in 2014 and as a result, the gross proceeds
deducted by the transactions costs less taxes, a total of eur 27.7 million, were recognised in the invested unrestricted equity
fund.

financials › consolidated financial statements › notes to the consolidated financial statements (ifrs) › 29 pension obligations



29 pension obligations
the company has in its operating countries several defined contribution pension plans which are subject to local regulation and
practices. the company’s one most significant pension plan is the finnish emplyees pensions act (tyel), in which the benefits
are determined directly on the basis of the level of the beneficiary’s earnings level. tyel pension plan is mainly arranged through
pension insurance companies and it is treated as a defined contribution plan.

at the end of 2014, the company had defined benefit pension plans in finland and norway. all plans at the year-end 2014 were
final salary defined benefit plans, and they supplement the statutory pensions or enable retirement before the statutory
retirement age. the company’s two defined benefit pension plans in norway were terminated during 2014 from which the
company recognised a curtailment gain of eur 0.2 million which was booked to other operating income. in 2013, some of the
company’s defined benefit plans were converted to defined contribution plans in norway. all of the plans’ obligations, eur 12.4
million, were settled. in addition, the company recognised a curtailment gain of eur 1.9 million, which was booked to other
operating income. three persons left the finnish plan in 2013, which was treated as a partial settlement of the obligation, and it
had no effect on the company’s income statement.

defined benefit plans’ assets consist entirely of qualifying insurance policies and are fair valued on the accounting date. these
assets do not include investments to lemminkäinen or to real estate or other assets used by the company. the expected return
on the plan assets is an estimate of a life insurance company's future long term total rebate.

when calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit pension obligation the same method has been applied as when
measuring the defined benefit pension obligation recognised in the balance sheet.

30 share-based payments
performance-based reward
years 2010–2012

lemminkäinen had a share-based incentive plan comprising three one-year earning periods: the calendar years 2010, 2011 and
2012. the board of directors decided on the earning criteria for each period as well as on the targets to be established at the
beginning of each earning period. in 2012, the earning criteria for long-term incentives were the targets set for the group’s
equity ratio and return on investment. the reward was paid partly in company shares and partly in cash. the proportion paid in
cash covered the taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward. the shares may not be transferred during the commitment
period which ends two years after the earning period ends.

years 2013–2015

at the end of 2012, the board of directors of lemminkäinen corporation decided on a new share-based incentive plan for the
group’s key personnel. the plan includes three one-year earning periods, calendar years 2013, 2014 and 2015. the company’s
board of directors will decide on the earning criteria and the targets to be set at the beginning of each earning period. the
potential performance-based reward for an earning period will be paid out in company shares and cash. the proportion to be
paid in cash will cover the taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward. the shares may not be transferred during the
commitment period of approximately two years. if a key person’s employment or service contract ends during the commitment
period, they will generally have to return any reward shares to the company without compensation.

conditional reward

as part of the plan the above mentioned key personnel has the opportunity to receive conditional reward, ie matching shares, on
the basis of their share ownership and continued employment or service contract. in order to receive the conditional reward, a
key person must already own or acquire a specified number of company shares, or a percentage thereof. the number and date
are set by the board of directors. in this case, the key person will be granted, as a reward, one share for each share acquired, as
long as their employment or service contract remains valid and they retain ownership of these shares until the conditional
reward is paid. the earning period for the conditional reward is the calendar years 2013–2015.

33 financial risk management
in its business operations, lemminkäinen group is exposed to financial risks, mainly funding, liquidity, foreign exchange rate,
interest rate and credit risks. the aim of the group's financial risk management is to reduce uncertainty concerning the possible
impacts that changes in fair values on the financial markets could have on the group's result, cash flow and value. the
management of financial risks is based on principles of the treasury policy approved by the board of directors. the treasury
policy defines the principles and division of responsibilities with regard to financial activities and the management of financial
risk. the policy is reviewed and if necessary updated at least annually.

execution of the treasury policy is the responsibility of the group treasury, which is mainly responsible for the management of
financial risks and handles the group's treasury activities on a centralised basis. the group's treasury policy defines the division
of responsibilities between the group treasury and business units in each subarea. the group companies are responsible for
providing the group treasury with up-to-date and accurate information on treasury-related matters concerning their business
operations. the group treasury serves as an internal bank and co-ordinates, directs and supports the group companies in
treasury matters such that the group's financial needs are met and its financial risks are managed effectively in line with the
treasury policy.

funding and liquidity risk
the group seeks to ensure the availability of funding, optimise the use of liquid assets in funding its business operations and to
minimise interest and other fiance costs. the group treasury is responsible for managing the group's overall liquidity and
ensuring that adequate credit lines and a sufficient number of different funding sources are available. it also ensures that the
maturity profile of the group's loans and credit facilities is spread sufficiently evenly over coming years as set out in the treasury
policy. the maturity schedule of the interest-bearing liabilities, as per the group’s accounting, is front-loaded. the reason for
this is the eur 127.1 million (eur 73.1 mill.) liabilities of housing and commercial property companies. these liabilities mainly
consist of non-current loans of housing companies under constraction which are recorded under current interest-bearing
liabilities, and will be transferred to the buyers of the co-op shares when the units are handed over. regarding unsold housing
units, the group will bear the liability by paying financial consideration for the units in question during a long loan period. the
group's available financing sources and liquid assets are sufficient to cover the obligations arising from current interest-bearing
liabilities.

according to the treasury policy, the group's liquidity reserve shall at all times match the group's total liquidity requirement, and
it must be accessible within five banking days without any additional charges being incurred. the group's total liquidity
requirement consists of the liquidity requirement of day-to-day operations, risk premium needs and the strategic liquidity
requirement. the group's liquidity management is based on monthly forecasts of funding requirements and daily cash flow
forecasting. the group's excess liquidity is managed by means of internal transactions and cash pools.

due to the nature of the group's business operations, seasonal borrowing is of great importance. the effect of seasonal
variation on short-term liquidity needs is controlled by using a commercial paper programme, committed credit limits and bank
overdraft facilities. the total amount of the group's commercial paper programme is eur 300 million (eur 300 mill.), of
which eur 63.4 million (eur 150.2 mill.) was in use at 31 december 2014. lemminkäinen has a eur 185 million, three-year
syndicated revolving credit facility. the credit facility is binding and unsecured, and its maturres in march 2016. at the end of
the year, the group had unused committed credit facilities amounting to eur 185.0 million (eur 175.0 mill.) and overdraft
limits amounting to eur 33.2 million (eur 44.0 mill.). the amount of liquid assets at 31 december 2014 was eur 134.2
million (eur 81.1 mill.).

foreign exchange rate risk
the aim of foreign exchange rate risk management is to reduce uncertainty concerning the possible impacts that changes in
exchange rates could have on the future values of cash flows, business receivables and liabilities, and other balance sheet
items. exchange rate risk mainly consists of translation risk and transaction risk.

translation risk consists of foreign exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the income statements and
balance sheets of foreign group companies into the group’s functional currency. translation risk recorded in accounting is
caused by equity investments in foreign entities and their retained earnings, the effects of which are recorded under translation
differences in shareholders’ equity. lemminkäinen group has foreign net investments in several currencies. the key currencies
in which the group was exposed to translation risk in 2014 were the russian rouble and the norwegian krone. it is likely that the
most significant translation risk is associated to these currencies in the future, too. the change in translation differences in
2014 was eur -18.6 million, of which eur -15.8 million was attributable to the russian rouble and eur -2.7 million to the
norwegian krone. reportable translation risk is also caused by the reporting period’s income statement, the impact of which can
be seen, among others, directly in the group’s reportable net sales and operating profit in euros. in 2014, the impact of
exchange rate changes on the group’s net sales was eur -73.2 million, of which eur -40.0 million was attributable to the
russian rouble and eur -19.7 million to the norwegian krone, and their impact on the operating profit was eur -5.0 million, of
which eur -4.3 million was attributable to the russian rouble and eur -0.6 million to the norwegian krone. in accordance
with the treasury policy, lemminkäinen group protects itself from translation risks primarily by keeping equity investments in
foreign entities at an appropriately low level, and thus does not use financial instruments to hedge the translation risks.

transaction risk consists of cash flows in foreign currencies from operational and financial activities. the group seeks to
hedge business currency risks primarily by operative means. the remaining transaction risk is hedged by using instruments such
as foreign currency loans and foreign currency derivatives.

the group companies are responsible for identifying, reporting, forecasting and hedging their transaction risk positions
internally. the group treasury is responsible for hedging the group's risk positions as external transactions in accordance with
the treasury policy. the general rule is that the major net positions, forecasted and known, for the 12 months following the
review date are hedged, with a hedging ratio ranging from 25–100 per cent and emphasising the first six months.

the key currencies in which the group was exposed to transaction risk in 2014 were russian rouble and swedish krona. these
transaction risk positions were mainly due to sales, procurements, receivables and liabilities. in 2014 the group did not apply
hedge accounting to transaction risk hedging.

sensitivity analysis of transaction risk

the following assumptions have been made when calculating the sensitivity caused by changes in exchange rates:

  the exchange rate change is assumed to be +/– 10%
  the position includes financial assets and liabilities denominated in swedish kronas and russian roubles
  the position does not include forecasted future cash flows
  taxes are excluded in sensitivity analysis

                                                                                                                     +/- 10% impact on

interest rate risk

the aim of lemminkäinen group's interest rate risk management is to minimise changes affecting the result, cash flows and
value of the group due to interest rate fluctuations. the group treasury manages and monitors the interest rate position. the
group's interest rate risk primarily comprises fixed-rate and variable-rate loan and leasing agreements, interest-bearing
financial receivables and interest rate derivatives. interest rate changes affect items in the income statement and balance sheet.

the interest rate risk is decreased by setting the group's average period of interest fixing term to the same as the interest rate
sensitivity of its business. the interest rate sensitivity position of the group's business is estimated to be about 15 months. the
treasury policy thus defines the group's average interest fixing term as 12–18 months. the group aims to keep 40–65 per cent
of its liabilities per currency hedged.

the group can have both variable and fixed-rate long-term borrowings. the ratio of fixed and variable-rate borrowings can be
changed by using interest rate derivatives. in 2014, the group has used interest rate swaps for managing interest rate risks. part
of the interest rate swaps were used for hedge accounting and a hedging result of those derivatives have been recognised in
interest expenses. there was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from hedge accounting during the financial year. hedging
instruments assigned to hedge accounting have matured and hedge accounting terminated during the reporting period.

interest rate fluctuations in 2014 did not have any unusual effect on the group's business, but a significant rise in the level of
interest rates may have a detrimental effect on the demand for housing.

sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk

the following assumptions are made when calculating the sensitivity caused by a change in the level of interest rates:

  the interest rate change is assumed to be 1 percentage point
  the position includes variable-rate financial liabilities, variable-rate financial receivables and interest rate derivatives
  all factors other than the change in interest rates remain constant
  taxes have not been taken into account when calculating sensitivity

commodity price risk
the group's paving operations are exposed to bitumen price risk. the price of bitumen is determined by the world market price
of oil in practise. the group protects itself against the bitumen price risk with fixed purchase prices, price clauses in sales
agreements and derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied. by the closing date, the group companies had used
bitumen derivatives to hedge, in total, 11,000 mt (58,933 mt) of bitumen purchases.

credit risk
credit risks arise when a counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligations, casusing the other party to suffer a financial
loss. lemminkäinen has defined a credit policy for customer receivables that aims to boost profitable sales by identifying credit
risks in advance and controlling them. the credit policy sets the minimum requirements concerning trade credit and collections
for lemminkäinen group. the group's credit control function defines credit risks and the business units are responsible for
managing them.

most of the group's business is based on established and trustworthy customer relationships and on contractual terms
generally observed in the industry. the group is exposed to credit risk mainly through the group's trade receivables and
receivables associated with deposits and receivables. the maximum amount of credit risk is the combined total of the balance
sheet values of the aforementioned items. the amounts and due dates of the group's trade receivables are presented in the
table below. the group does not have any significant credit risk concentrations as trade receivables are distributed among many
different customers in a number of market areas. the business unit that made the contract actively monitors the receivables
situation. if the business units renegotiate the terms of the receivables, they must do so in accordance with the requirements of
the group's credit policy. the risk of credit losses can be reduced by means of guarantees, mainly bank guarantees and bank
deposits. in addition, lemminkäinen uses factoring arrangements which also mitigates the credit risk.

lemminkäinen's credit losses have been minimal in relation to the scale of its operations. the main risks are associated with
business in russia. as a general rule, construction projects in russia are only undertaken against receipt of advance payments.
if, in exceptional situations, a credit risk is taken, the amount permitted is always proportional to the expected margin on the
project in question. receiveables transferred for legally enforceable collection are recognised as credit losses.

the group is exposed to counterparty risk when investing liquid assets and using derivative instruments. liquid assets are
invested in short-term bank deposits, certificates of deposit issued by solvent partner banks, and commercial papers issued by
corporations with a good credit rating. the group treasury is responsible for the management of the group's counterparty and
credit risks related to cash, financial investments and financial transactions. the treasury policy specifies the approved
counterparties and their criteria. at the end of 2014, the counterparty risk was considered to be low.

at a competitive level in all cyclical conditions, that risk-carrying capacity is adequate, for example, in construction contracts,
and that the company is able to service its borrowings and pay a good dividend.

the amount of the group's interest-bearing liabilities is affected by factors such as scale of operations, seasonal changes in
production, acquisitions, investments in or the sale of production equipment, buildings and land, and possible equity related
arrangements. the company continuously monitors especially the amount of debt, the ratio of net debt to ebitda, and the
equity ratio. the company also follows the development of equity by means of the return on investment. a long-term average in
excess of 18 per cent is regarded as a good return. the return on investment in 2014 was 13.5 per cent (-9.4%).

we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity
securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the amounts involved may be material. we
may decide to hold, cancel or sell such repurchased debt. possible subsequent sales of repurchased debt may be made against
cash or other compensation or in exchange for equity securities and such sales may be executed as open market offers, privately
negotiated transactions or otherwise. repurchases or exchanges of outstanding debt or subsequent sales or exchanges of
repurchased debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and
other factors.

some of the group's financial arrangements include two financial covenants, the ratio of net debt to ebitda and the equity
ratio, which are monitored quarterly and calculated as an average of four previous quarters, which are monitored quarterly and
calculated as an average of four previous quarters. the terms of the net debt/ebitda covenant were not met in the first quarter.
consequently, the company started negotiations with certain lenders, which were completed on 21 may 2014. due to the
negotiations, the company has committed to strengthening its balance sheet with approximately eur 100 million, among other
measures. in the third quarter, the company conducted a rights offering. with the offering, the company raised gross proceeds
of eur 29.3 million (net proceeds of eur 27.3 million). in addition, the company will divest non-core assets and operations by
eur 70 million by the end of september 2015. at the end of 2014, the company had carried out divestments amounting to
eur 21.5 million. the company will not pay any dividends for 2014 without the consent of certain lenders. furthermore, in the
second quarter the company agreed with its lenders on changes to the net debt to ebitda covenant for the second and third
quarters of 2014. at the end of the year, the company met its covenants.

in addition, the company has taken several other measures to strengthen its balance sheet and to improve its financial position.
in the first quarter, the company issued a eur 70 million hybrid bond. in the second quarter, the company divested its technical
building services business for eur 55.4 million and used the inbound cash flow from the divestment for repayment of current
liabilities. in addition, the company issued a eur 100 million unsecured senior five-year bond in june 2014. the eur 100
million bond issued by the company was used for refinancing the eur 60 million bond that matured in october 2014. the bond
carries a fixed annual coupon at the rate of 7.375 per cent payable semi-annually. the terms and conditions of the bond include
two financial incurrence-based covenants: an equity ratio and net debt to ebitda. if the equity ratio covenant is not met, the
company is restricted from making certain payments, including repurchases of its own shares and redemption of hybrid bonds.
if the net debt to ebitda covenant is not met, the company is restricted in its ability to raise additional debt.

the group's equity includes two eur 70 million hybrid bonds with no maturity date. the first of these was issued in march
2012 and the second in march 2014. these hybrid bonds are classified as equity instrument but the bond holders do not have
any rights of a shareholders, and the bond does not dilute shareholders' ownership in the company. the hybrid bonds are
unsecured and junior to all other borrowings of the company. the bond have no maturity date but company has the right to
redeem them at it's own discretion after four years of the issuance date.

the fair value of derivative instruments is the gain or loss arising from the settlement of the contract at the market price
prevailing on the reporting date.

hedge accounting has not been applied to all derivative instruments. nevertheless, these derivative instruments have been
utilised for hedging purposes. the derivatives are used in order to reduce business risks and to hedge balance-sheet items
denominated in foreign currencies. changes in the fair value of non-hedge accounted derivatives are recognised through profit
or loss in accordance with their nature either in financial items or as other operating income and expenses.

financial derivatives are subject to master netting or similar arrangements which are enforceable in some circumstances.
according to these arrangements above mentioned derivative assets and derivative liabilities could be settled on a net basis.
netting arrangements are enforceable according to typical negligence events or other events of default as the general terms for
derivative transactions applies. these items are recognised on gross basis in the balance sheet. net figures would have been
eur 1.4 million (eur 0.8 mill.) smaller than the figures presented in the table.

where the plaintiffs’ claims were upheld, to the helsinki court of appeal. in lemminkäinen’s opinion, there are some judicial
aspects in the decisions, where the conclusions of the district court differ from previous legal practices. such judicial aspects
are related to the questions of prescriptions and value added tax, for example. the main oral hearing in the court of appeal will
take place during 2015. the finnish state and 22 municipalities have also submitted their appeals to the helsinki court of
appeal. in addition to the claims decided on by the district court in november 2013, 21 claims against lemminkäinen and other
asphalt industry companies for damages are waiting for the main proceeding to begin. these damages amount to a total of
approximately eur 26 million and the company has made a eur 12.3 million provision for them.

in addition, the company has several other individual legal proceedings related to business operations, the outcome of which is
uncertain. the company estimates that these legal proceedings will not have a material impact on the company’s financial
position.

short-term employee benefits

a fixed basic salary refers to a person's monthly salary, which is determined by the requirements of the position as well as the
performance and experience of the person holding the position. in addition to the use of a company car and mobile phone and a

specified at the beginning of the year. lemminkäinen's management is divided into four performance-related reward groups
which define the maximum performance-related reward percentage for each person. defining a person's reward group is based
on organisation level as well as the requirements and operational influence of the position. in 2014 the level of performance-
related reward of the management was based on profit before taxes and reaching goals related efficiency improvement
measures and other development targets. performance-related rewards of the executive vice presidents of the business
segments, who are members of the group's executive team were also based on the operating profits of each segment.
achieving targets set on performance-related rewards were assessed semi-annually. the maximum performance bonus payable
to the president and ceo was 80 per cent of the annual salary and 60 per cent for other members of the group executive team.

annual general meeting held after their election. the members of lemminkäinen’s board of directors do not belong to the
share-based incentive plan, and they are not employees of lemminkäinen. the 2014 annual general meeting decided that the
chairman would be paid a fee of eur 10,000 per month (eur 10,000) and the board members would each receive a fee of
eur 3,000 per month (eur 3,000). the board members also receive an attendance fee of eur 500 per meeting (eur 500).

committee eur 500 (eur 500) for each meeting of the committee. board members living outside finland receive an extra

team the equivalent severance pay equals to six months cash salary at the time of the agreement’s termination. severance pay

board of directors decides on the earning criteria and the targets to be set at the beginning of each period. performance based
compensation targets for 2014 were related to the company’s return on investment and equity ratio.

in addition to the performance-based reward, the key personnel also have the opportunity to receive a conditional reward based
on share ownership and a continuation of their employment or service contract. the conditional reward seeks to encourage the
group’s key personnel to increase their holding in the company. the earning period for the conditional reward is the calendar
