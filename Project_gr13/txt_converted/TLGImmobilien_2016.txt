the first
step


over the past few years we have paved the way
for successful corporate development. now that we
have guiding principles for our actions, we want to
document our corporate activities in connection with
the environment and society regularly for our
stakeholders, in addition to our financial reporting.
this sustainability report represents our first step.

as with every strategy we pursue, our objective is clear:
we want to strengthen the long-term trust of our
partners.

dear shareholders,
dear business partners and tenants,
dear sir or madam,




                              business with real estate could be assumed to be inherently sustainable due to
                              its long-term planning horizons. a property is normally used over a number of
                              years, even in the commercial sector. additionally, the social and energy-related
                              aspects of the running costs and potential usage of a property are of great
                              significance.

                              contemporary sustainable property management involves far more than the
                              compilation of economic, ecological and social data, and gradually improving
                              them in line with a plan. this is due to a factor that in its current form is new to
                              property markets – flexibilisation. brought about by the underlying changes in the
                              worlds of work and commerce, property markets have become significantly more
                              flexible and therefore unpredictable.

                              with an even greater sense of priority, this raises more questions in connection
                              with the properties in our portfolio and potential acquisitions that have always
                              been important to us as a quality-oriented portfolio and asset manager:


                                  • will the location of the property still be in demand in ten years?
                                  • how can our properties still serve the utilisation concepts of tenants
                                     in the long term?
                                  •  will
                                         it be possible to manage the building itself profitably in 20 years?

                              in the future we aim to address these and similar issues in more depth and
                              ensure that we remain on track.

                              the publication of this sustainability report should underline our intentions. it
                              should signal that we aim to report on our long-term strategy regularly and
                              transparently for our shareholders and partners. by adhering to the relevant
                              sustainability reporting standards, we are also making ourselves comparable with
                              the rest of the sector. we are publishing this sustainability report on a voluntary
                              basis – as due to our number of employees – we will not be subject to the eu
                              guidelines on methodology for reporting non-financial information that are due to
                              come into force in 2017.

our first sustainability report

this is the first sustainability report published by tlg immobilien. it is our first
review and will enable us to expand and enhance our sustainability reports over
the next few years. the report uses financial and non-financial information to paint
a holistic picture of our corporate performance. the financial information comprises
information on our business model, corporate targets, our business performance in
2015 and selected key performance indicators. please see our annual report 2015
for more detailed information. the non-financial aspects include the social and
ecological aspects of tlg immobilien.

we are publishing this report on a voluntary basis – as due to our number of
employees – we will not be subject to the eu guidelines on methodology for
reporting non-financial information that are due to come into force in the coming
year. in publishing this report we hope to make it clear to our stakeholders that
sustainability is an important part of our value chain and aspects of sustainability
are factored into our business decisions.

the disclosures in this report are based on the g4 guidelines of the global reporting
initiative (gri) and factor in industry-specific information for construction and real
estate. in our estimation they are in accordance with the option “core”. — g4-32
additionally, the disclosures are based on the epra best practice recommendations
on sustainability reporting, the criteria of the german sustain­ability code (dnk)
and the sustainability code of the german property federation (zia). the contents
of the report was not audited by an independent third party. — g4-33 in the future,
the sustainability report of tlg immobilien will be published annually. — g4-30



content and structure

in order to determine the content of the report, we compiled topics relevant to the
sustainability of our business activities and assessed their relevance by means of
benchmark analyses, consultations with experts and interviews with representa-
tives of the company who, through their role, are in daily contact with relevant
groups of stakeholders. — g4-18

this report focuses on economic, ecological and social aspects. the categorisation
of the content of the report into the three dimensions of sustainability reflects the
three key fields which tlg immobilien influences and affects through its business
activities.



reporting boundaries

the reporting period consists of the 2015 financial year (01/01/2015–31/12/2015) as
well as 2014 as a reference (01/01/2014–31/12/2014). — g4-28 all figures relating to
personnel as well as the consumption values encompass the tlg immobilien group
(tlg immobilien) with the exception of tlg gewerbepark grimma gmbh which had
been disposed of as at 31 december 2015. — g4-17

the company

in preparing for our ipo in 2014, we focused the strategy of
our company on steady growth. quality is a key aspect for us
in this context, both in connection with the portfolio and its
management and in terms of the services for our tenants. a
top-quality portfolio, the comprehensive real estate expertise
of our employees and efficient processes serve as a platform
for us to support our tenants.

activities with consideration for the various
requirements and interests of all our stakeholders.

economy and value creation:
a long-term strategy

tlg immobilien is operating
in a competitive market with ambitious
targets: high-quality commercial
properties in highly rated locations are
in demand in germany. we are well-
prepared for this competition: our business
model is as well-aligned to our objective
as our portfolio and the processes
with which we manage it. complementing
these strengths, there are two highly
important factors that will help us reach
our targets: we have the economic capacity
and the trust of our investors.

stage, we set ourselves the objective of increasing the value
of our portfolio to eur 2 bn by the end of 2017.

we made a good start in 2015: in the financial year, the ac-
quisition of new properties as well as positive valuations due
to the favourable market situation caused the value of the
portfolio to increase disproportionately by 15.7% to eur 1.766
bn. however, for the purposes of portfolio optimisation the
disposal of non-strategic properties is also a key aspect of
our strategy. we reinvest the proceeds from disposals in stra-

outlook and targets

we see sustainability reports less as
reflections of what we have achieved
in the previous year and more as reflections
of our progress towards our targets:
they show us what we have done already
and allow us to identify room for
improvement. we want to tap this
potential with clear targets.

heat consumption in our properties
in some of our properties heat consumption is logged cen-                        which the consumption was attributable. in this context we

data for the common parts, vacant and lettable areas to                          that were available to us.
