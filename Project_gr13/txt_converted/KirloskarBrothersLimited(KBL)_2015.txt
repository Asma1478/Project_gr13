    state of affairs of the company

    the revenue from operations for the year under review is ` 1626 crores, which is less than 7.61% compared to the
    previous year. drop in sales is mainly due to lower sales of project sectors, partly attributable to liquidity issue in the
    market and non-receipt of dispatch clearances from the customers.

    the economic condition of the country continued to be sluggish throughout the year. the company continued its focus
    of being selective in accepting orders depending on customers’ financial position. there was concentrated effort
    towards improvement of marketing initiatives and brand presence. overall efforts were made to improve the
    efficiencies at all plants.

    for project business, the company continues to focus on closure of old projects and recovery of retention money. the
    main reasons for major drop in sales of project sectors was due to non receipt of advances / l/c from customers, delay
    in engineering and civil work by few clients and non receipt of dues from few customers.

    the company has launched towards the year end, highly-advanced “i-can” series of pumps, designed to reduce
    maintenance time and total cost of ownership (tco) for the small scale industries.

    endorsing the prime minister’s “make in india” call, the company has also launched another product “i-ns” pump,
    which has been developed entirely with domestic technology. the new innovative features make the “i-ns” series
    pump ideal for dewatering function in the water & wastewater treatment industries, sewage, building & construction
    and other allied segments.

    kirloskarvadi plant received the national energy management award. kondhapuri plant developed and dispatched
    1800 mm sluice valves (largest size so far) & 2400 mm turbine inlet valves were manufactured and completed testing
    and inspection and received orders from state water supply & sewerage boards for various types of valves. dewas
    plant was recognized by cii for “significant achievement on the journey towards business excellence”, was awarded
    tcm level 4 by cii and produced all time highest db pumps in the month of december 2014. kaniyur plant received
    “merit award” for 5s by cii. sanand plant received “energy efficient unit” award in 15th cii national award for excellence
    in energy management 2014 and was recognized by cii for greenco “silver” certification.

    there were no material changes or commitments to report which affect the financial position of the company that has
    occurred between the end of financial year and the date of this report.

      non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities and disclosure of the contingent liabilities at the end
      of each reporting period. although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current

notes to accounts : part b (contd.)

     c)    forward exchange contracts: in respect of transactions covered by forward exchange contracts, the
           difference between the forward rate and the exchange rate (premium) at the date of the transaction is
           recognized as income or expense over the life of the contract.

b-10 investments

     investments are classified as trade when investment is made in the shares or debentures of another company for
     the purpose of promoting the trade or business of the company.

     investments that are readily realizable and intended to be held for not more than a year from the date on which
     such investment is made are classified as current investments. all other investments are classified as long-term
     investments.

     a)    current investments are carried at lower of cost and fair value determined on an individual investment
           basis.

     b)    long-term investments are carried at cost. however, provision for diminution in value is made to
           recognize a decline other than temporary in the value of such investments.

b-11 employee benefits

     the actuarial valuations in respect of post-employment defined benefit plans and long term employee benefit as
     at the balance sheet date are measured using projected unit credit method.

     i.     short term employee benefits

           all employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the services are classified as short
           term employee benefits. benefits such as salaries, wages, expected cost of bonus and short term
           compensated absences, leave travel allowance etc. are recognized in the period in which the employee
           renders the related service.

     ii.   post-employment benefits

           a)      defined contribution plans

                   the company’s superannuation scheme, state governed provident fund scheme related to dewas
                   factory and employee state insurance scheme are defined contribution plans. the contribution
                   paid/payable under the scheme is recognized during the period in which the employee renders the
                   related service.

           b)      defined benefit plans

                   the employees’ gratuity fund schemes, provident fund scheme managed by a trust and pension
                   scheme are the company’s defined benefit plans. the present value of the obligation under such
                   defined benefit plans is determined based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit
                   method, which recognizes each period of service as giving rise to additional unit of employee
                   benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.

                                                                                                                             87

     notes to accounts : part b (contd.)

                       the obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. the discount
                       rates used for determining the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plans, is based
                       on the market yields on government securities as at the balance sheet date, having maturity
                       periods approximating to the terms of related obligations.

                       actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the profit & loss statement.

                       in case of funded plans, the fair value of the plan’s assets is reduced from the gross obligation
                       under the defined benefit plans, to recognize the obligation on net basis.

                       gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of any defined benefit plan are recognized when
                       the curtailment or settlement occurs. past service cost is recognized as expenses on a straight-line
                       basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.

                       the company pays contribution to a recognized provident fund trust in respect of all locations
                       except dewas factory. the guidance note on implementing as 15, employees benefits (revised
                       2006) as issued by the institute of chartered accountants of india (icai) states that provident funds
                       set up by employer, which requires interest shortfall to be met by the employer, needs to be treated
                       as a defined benefit plan. in the absence of clear guidelines on the issue of actuarial valuation
                       related to the interest shortfall to be made good by the employer, the company’s actuary have
                       expressed their inability to reliably measure the provident fund liability of the company’s
                       recognized provident fund. accordingly, the company is unable to exhibit the related disclosures.

          costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

     b-13 segment accounting

          the company’s business segment is a distinguishable component that is engaged in providing an individual
          product or service or a group of related products or services and that is subject to risks and returns that are
          different from those of other business segments. the company’s geographical segment is based on the location
          of its customers.

          a)     the accounting policies for individual segments are in line with accounting policies of the company.

          b)     segment revenue from inter segment transactions is accounted on the basis of transfer price agreed

                                  consolidated financial statements
                                  independent auditors’ report
                     to the board of directors of kirloskar brothers limited


      report on the consolidated financial statements

      we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of kirloskar brothers limited (“the company”)
      and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “the group”), and jointly controlled entity which comprise the consolidated
      balance sheet as at march 31st 2015, the consolidated profit and loss statement and consolidated cash flow statement
      for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

      management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements

      management is responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of
      the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows of the group and
      jointly controlled entity in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in india including the accounting
      standards specified under section 133 of the act, read with rule 7 of the companies (accounts) rules, 2014. this
      responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and
      presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material
      misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

      auditor’s responsibility

      our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. we conducted
      our audit in accordance with the standards on auditing issued by the institute of chartered accountants of india. those
      standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
      assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

      an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
      financial statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks
      of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk
      assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the group’s preparation and presentation of the
      consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
      the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.
      an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the
      accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
      statements.

      we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

      opinion

      in our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the
      consideration of the reports of the other auditors on the financial statements of the subsidiaries as noted below, the
      consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally
      accepted in india:

          (a) in the case of the consolidated balance sheet, of the state of affairs of the group as at march 31st, 2015;

          (b) in the case of the consolidated profit and loss statement, of the profit for the year ended on that date; and

          (c) in the case of the consolidated cash flow statement, of the cash flows for the year ended on that date

                                                                                                         2014 - 2015


emphasis of matter

we draw attention to the following matters in the notes to the consolidated financial statements:

    a. in respect of kirloskar brother limited - we draw attention to the matter in note part b-14regarding justification
       given by the management for non-provision for diminution in the value of its long term investment in its
       subsidiary company the kolhapur steel limited. as explained in the note, in the opinion of the management,
       diminution in the value is temporary in nature for the reasons given therein.

    b. in respect of the kolhapur steel limited – the company has accumulated losses and its net worth has been
       fully eroded, the company has incurred a netloss/net cash loss during the current and previous year(s) and,
       the company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets as at the balance sheet date. these conditions,
       along with other matters set forth in note part b-15, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may
       cast significant doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. however, the financial
       statements of the company have been prepared on going concern basis for the reasons stated in the said
       note.

our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

other matters

we did not audit the financial statements of certain subsidiaries, and a jointly controlled entity, whose financial
statements reflect total assets of ` 7,220,181,275/- as at 31st march, 2015, total revenues of ` 10,511,208,369/- and net
cash flows amounting to ` 25,423,263/- for the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial
statements. these financial statements have been audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us
by the management and our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and
disclosures included in respect of the subsidiaries and jointly controlled entity, and our report in terms of sub-sections
(3) of section 143 of the act, insofar as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries and jointly controlled entity, is based solely
on the reports of the other auditors.

our opinion on the consolidated financial statements is not modified in respect of the above matters with respect to our
reliance on the work done and the reports of the other auditors.

b-14 kirloskar brothers limited:

      the net worth of the kolhapur steel ltd. (tksl), a subsidiary company of kirloskar brothers ltd. (kbl) has
      turned negative in previous year and the company has made an application to board of industrial financial
      reconstruction (bifr) under sick industrial companies act, 1985.(sica). kbl has infused ` 150,000,000/- by
      way of preference shares during the current year and will continue to support its operations going forward as the
      kbl management is confident of its growth and expects a turnaround in the near future. in view of the same and
      taking into consideration the realizable value of tksl’s assets, diminution in value of kbl’s investment in tksl is
      temporary in nature and as such no provision for the same is considered necessary as per as-13, accounting for
      investment, notified under the companies (accounting standards) rules, 2006.

b-15 the kolhapur steel limited:

      the company has turned sick industrial company due to negative net worth on basis of financials for the year
      ending 31st march 2014. the reasons for sickness are poor utilization of available resources, process
      obsolescence, quality issues and the resultant sales returns, poor cash generation and overdue creditors,
      unbalanced foundry infrastructure resulting in poor productivity and other controllable factors. although the
      company improved its operating revenue over the previous year, the results finally turned out to be negative and
      continues to show negative net worth as on 31st march 2015. the holding company is committed to support the
      subsidiary’s operations and infused money by way of preference shares to reduce the negative net worth. to
      achieve the turnover as planned for revival, the company’s foundry has taken initiatives under “project
      parivartan”, based on two objectives:

      a)     to capture business plan from new potential customers for making heavy castings by increasing molten
             metal capacity and process upgradation in all functions of foundry.

      b)     to focus on customer complaints to address quality related issues, rework and quality loss due to more
             upgradation.

      further to reduce both internal and external rejection and also to reduce cost of quality, the company’s foundry
      processes are mapped for upgradation in all work functions of foundry.

      based on above steps taken, the company, with support of holding company, expects to turn itself around and
      revive.
