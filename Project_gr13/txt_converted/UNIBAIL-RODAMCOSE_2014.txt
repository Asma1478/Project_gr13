dear shareholders,
   2013 was a special year for the group. firstly, the 25th of april, i have had the honor to take over
the reins of unibail-rodamco when guillaume poitrinal decided to bring the succession process
to a close. i would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him, who through his 18 years of
dedication to the group, was able to turn a french company called unibail into the world-class
leader in commercial real estate we know today. secondly, following this change in leadership,
i thought it was also the right time to rethink the management board, creating a new group of highly
skilled, highly different and highly complementary individuals, who i am sure, will guide the group
to new successes.

  operationally, our ability to predict and understand customer expectations has enabled
unibail-rodamco to deliver a remarkable performance in all its three activities despite the weakness
of europe’s economic recovery. three fundamentals underpin the group’s ability to remain at the
forefront of changes in the market: concentration, differentiation and innovation. we continue to focus
our portfolio on assets with high growth potential, namely large, high quality shopping and leisure
destinations in the best locations. as a result, more than 90% of our retail portfolio attracts more than
6 million visits a year. we will continue our successful, disciplined, approach to disposals - we expect
to dispose an estimated €1.5 bn to €2.0 bn worth of shopping centres in the next five years.

 we use differentiation and innovation initiatives to further bolster the intrinsic qualities of these
prime assets. the group’s shopping centres have become leisure destinations, true multi-sensory
environments with unique architecture, spectacular events, differentiating retailers, outstanding
services and innovative digital tools. in short, we create exceptional places for the best brands to
meet the largest number of customers.

  however, this is just the beginning. to continue to set ourselves apart, we have intensified our
focus on innovation in 2013. ur lab, the group’s innovation incubator, inaugurated its own campus
in december, providing a real scale test lab to develop new concepts. unibail-rodamco has
innovation in its dna: after digital dream™, iconic shop fronts, the dining experience™ or the new
art of working™ for offices, we will continue to dare to be different and redefine tomorrow’s retail,
office and convention & exhibition assets.

  we are confident that even the most challenging markets will reveal exciting opportunities for
those who are capable to innovate and make a difference. 2013 was an outstanding year with
€1.1 bn worth of projects delivered, including aéroville located next to the roissy-charles de
gaulle airport near paris and the extensions of centrum černý most in prague and täby centrum
in stockholm. these projects, as well as a pipeline of €6.9 bn, are proof of the group’s confidence
in the opportunities ahead.

  none of this performance would be possible without the dedication of the group’s exceptional
teams. each of our assets is connected to the social, economic and environmental issues of its
community, embodies the operational complexity and turnover of a large company, involves local
challenges and yet is managed by a handful of people. our ambition is to be the leader in all our
markets. this necessitates highly skilled and passionate individuals, entrepreneurs, whose vision is
to set the group apart.

 our unwavering commitment to satisfying our stakeholders has made alll the di      ce
                                                                                     e in the
                                                                            difference        pa
                                                                                              p

and i have no doubt this will drive our continued success in the future.

 sincerely,

                    to two factors: high
quality assets, as shown by the 20%
increase in footfall at splau, a prime
shopping centre in barcelona, and
the group’s superior active asset
management, which resulted in
favourable leasing activity.
with these two elements in place,
i have no doubt that the group will
continue this positive momentum over
the coming years”.

 (1) like-for-like change net of investments from december 31, 2012 to december 31, 2013.
 (2) yield impact calculated using the change in potential yields (to neutralise changes in vacancy rates) and taking into account key money. in nordics the like-for-like change and
     subsequent yield impact are calculated on a significantly reduced scope due to on-going extension/refurbishment works on the group’s large shopping centres täby, solna and
     nacka. in austria, the negative yield impact is explained by the growth in potential yield due to the increase in contracted rental income in shopping city süd, compensated by the
     significant investments realised in the asset in 2013.

corporate sustainability | strategy and organisation




corporate sustainability
with a portfolio valued at €32.1 bn as at december 31, 2013, unibail-rodamco has integrated its social and environmental
responsibilities into its business model. since 2007, the group has published an annual corporate sustainability report which aims
to provide a clear, objective picture of its goals and results. since the 2010 reporting period, the corporate sustainability report has
been integrated into the annual report to reﬂect the fact that sustainable practices are fully integrated into the group’s everyday
operations.

in 2013, the group started implementing its reﬁned long term sustainability strategy and priorities, based on the conclusions of
the materiality review carried out at the end of 2012. in particular, the cooperation with stakeholders and local economic
development is now of greater importance in the group’s sustainability initiatives, which sustain and create value for both
the company and its stakeholders. at the same time, the group maintained its efforts in tackling environmental issues, which is
illustrated by the increase in environmental certiﬁcation for its entire portfolio and development projects. in 2013, 15 additional
shopping centers and 4 additional office buildings obtained the highest scores in breeam-in-use certiﬁcates, reaching 53%
(in value) of the standing retail properties awarded with an environmental certiﬁcation and for more than 1.6 million m2 gla.

for more details on 2013 progress, kpis and the long term targets please see pages 99-102. the environmental information and
indicators disclosed in the following pages cover 78% of the total gross market value of the group’s consolidated asset portfolio as at
december 31, 2013 and 100% of the group’s entities with employees for human resources information (excluding comexposium).

this performance has been led by:
(i) ambitious energy-saving programmes that operate across all
     of the group’s assets
(ii) and the low-carbon energy purchase policy
(iii) the capacity of the group to drive its business successfully
     (continuous increase of footfall).

mpi: co2 emissions (kgco2e) [g4-en15 en16 en19]

  co2 emissions related to energy consumption are calculated from the absolute energy consumption kpi. the co2 figures are
calculated with local emission factors for each source of energy consumption. these factors depend on the source of energy (electricity
gas etc.) the country and the energy supplier. the kpi highlights the split between direct co2 emissions (scope 1: gas and fuel oil) and
indirect co2 emissions (scope 2: electricity district heating network and district cooling network).

  when calculating co2 emissions the value of zero for the emission factor is applied to the green electricity purchased. in the same
country every asset uses the same source of co2 emission factors (supplier or iea) in order to avoid double counting of national
renewable energy.

mpi: energy consumption (kwh) [g4-en3 en4 en6 en7]

  energy consumption includes both direct and indirect energy. direct energy refers to primary source energy which is purchased and
consumed on site (e.g. gas and fuel oil). indirect energy refers to energy produced by and purchased from a third party in the converted
form of electricity or fluid (e.g. electricity heating/cooling network or steam). for shopping centres offices and convention & exhibition
venues final energy purchased for use in common areas includes car parks and common equipment (heating & cooling distribution
power ventilation vertical transportation and lighting) and energy provided to tenants for heating and/or cooling. electricity purchased
by tenants is not included.

the group’s economic success is founded on the strength of its relationships with stakeholders: tenants, customers, investors, local
communities, suppliers and contractors, and employees. the need to develop and operate assets that meet stakeholders’ expectations
in terms of shopping experience, ﬁnancial return and environmental performance is central to the group’s strategy. these areas are
embedded in the group’s operating structure and product development process, are regularly discussed at supervisory board and
management board level, and are subject to careful analysis and monitoring. relevant tools have been developed to identify and
respond to the expectations of each stakeholder community and communicate this information to top managers and on-site
operational teams.

8.2. gri g4
in 2013, the group makes the transition from the application level b+ of the global reporting initiative construction & real estate
sector supplement reporting framework (gri3.1 cress published in 2011) to the g4 new guidelines deeply modiﬁed and published
in may 2013.

 the core approach is chosen for the first year reporting under g4. the concordance table below shows where the information has
been disclosed in this annual report. the “reported” column indicates the level of reporting for each indicator.

 unibail-rodamco fully reports all profile (53) disclosures and selected 18 thematics as being material to its sector’s activity.

 36 material performance indicators and 4 additional indicators (not related to material thematics) are reported.
