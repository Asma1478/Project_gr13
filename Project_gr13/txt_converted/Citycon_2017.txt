management                                                            citycon’s approach to environmental management is governed by the company’s strategy, goals and environmental programme.
approach                         the objectives and measures specified in the environmental programme have been integrated into day-to-day operations and ordinary practices in shopping centre management and property development.

                                                              environmental indicators are part of the company’s quarterly reporting. to achieve the environmental targets, citycon applies the following principles:

                                                                                      – observing environmental responsibility in all functions and anticipating future amendments to legislation.
                                                                                              – continuously developing steering, management and reporting of environmental practices.
                                                                                         – expecting partners to operate in a way that supports the fulfilment of citycon’s environmental goals.
                                                                           – guiding personnel towards sustainability in environmental issues through target-setting, training and internal communications.

                                               our approach to managing our social impacts culminates in hr management and the promotion of ethical principles and good administrative practices throughout the value chain.
                                                                                          the hr strategy and shared hr processes provide support and guidance for leadership.

    for 2014-2016. kista galleria’s environmental data is not included for previous years. due to deregulation of shopping center opening hours in finland in 2016, the energy consumption in finnish premises has increased.

4)	energy used for heating and cooling is reported in its entirety.								
5)	in terms of intensity figures, citycon has limited the reported electricity consumption to common areas, where it can directly influence. this includes the electricity used for general lighting, ventilation and cooling, as well as lifts and escalators and
    other building technical systems. 								
6)	excluding shopping centres where amount of visitors is not collected. in 2016 these were fruängen centrum, högdalen centrum, myllypuro, heikintori, glasshuspassasjen, krokstad senter and lade.
7)	the reported consumption includes the headquarters and citycon norway office 2015–2016, other offices are integrated into shopping centres. heating, water and waste in offices are excluded from reporting as they are included in the rent and not

8)	fuels include oil, natural gas and biofuel. biofuel (renewable) represents 7,5% of fuel consumption in properties.
9)	baseline corrected intensity includes citycon norway data 2014, in addition the intensity is calculated with weather corrected heating consumption.
