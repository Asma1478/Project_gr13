a foreword from the chairman


i am pleased to present the annual report for city west water for the year ended 30 june 2012.
overall, the company performed very well across its triple bottom line key performance indicators. profit before tax was
$71.7m compared to budget of $63.1m and last year’s profit before tax of $87.7m. growth in sales revenue of 17.8 per cent has
been offset by increases in bulk charges (33.9 per cent), depreciation and finance charges as well as a reduction in developer
related revenues.
total borrowings increased by 23.4 per cent ($142.4m) during 2011-12, mainly to fund the required capital expenditure to
support growth in our licence area as well as investment in the company’s existing infrastructure assets. at the same time,
finance charges increased by 15.5 per cent to $45.9m.
bulk water purchased for the year was 96.3 gigalitres (gl) compared to last year’s 92.6 gl, an increase of 4 per cent.
growth in our customer base of 2.9 per cent, as well as the easing of water restrictions to stage 1 contributed to
increased demand.
the ministerial advisory council’s (mac) living melbourne living victoria implementation plan, as well as the government’s
response has been released. central to the implementation plan is the development of a metropolitan integrated water cycle
management strategy as well as the establishment of the office of living victoria. city west water is actively participating
in the implementation of the metropolitan integrated water cycle management strategy.
as at 1 july 2012 the business held by city west water limited transfers to a statutory corporation known as city west water
corporation under the water amendment (governance and other reforms) act 2012 (vic). the other two metropolitan water
retailers, south east water and yarra valley water, also become statutory corporations on this date. the entities’ governing
legislation changes from the water industry act 1994 (vic) to the water act 1989 (vic). while the change in form
is not expected to have a significant impact on the company’s operations, it is expected that the water retailers will be provided
with additional revenue collection powers. the extent of these additional collection powers will be regulated by the essential
services commission (esc). it is expected that the esc will issue a draft customer code in coming months as part of its
consultation process.
city west water has completed the enterprise design and release one design phases of its business transformation program
(the arrow program), which involves the phased replacement of the company’s disparate it systems with an integrated oracle
software solution. when the program is fully implemented over the next few years, the company’s operations will be simplified,
efficiency improved and customer service capability strengthened. the build phase of release one will begin in 2012-13.
early in the year, the business experienced management and staff problems in its contact centre, which resulted in missed
targets for time to answer phone calls and complaints to the energy & water ombudsman of victoria. corrective processes
were implemented, but improved performance could not achieve year end targets. the business did, however, achieve
a customer satisfaction rating of 95.6 per cent.
during the year, three members of the board of directors retired from their positions. on behalf of the board, i would like to
acknowledge the contributions of alan e. seale, chairman for six years, deborah radford, director and chairman of the
risk management and audit committee for six years, and peter hansen, director for six and a half years.

an independent valuation of land and buildings was undertaken by a registered valuer, karl cundall of valueit pty ltd on behalf
of valuer general victoria as at 30 june 2011. fair value is determined using direct comparison with market based transactions
for comparable properties in comparable areas, or the capitalisation of net income approach. the historical cost of land and the
historical written down value of buildings at 30 june 2012 would have been $2.297m and $10.124m respectively.
at the direction of the minister for finance, and in line with whole of government reporting, city west water first adopted fair
value for its infrastructure assets as at 30 june 2010. prior to this, the company’s infrastructure assets had been carried at
historical cost. the valuation of the company’s infrastructure assets was undertaken by deloitte using the discounted cash flow
method, which calculates fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows to their present value. city west water’s fair value
of infrastructure assets as at 30 june 2012 was also performed by deloitte. a nominal after tax discount rate of approximately
6.6 per cent was used to discount the estimated future cash flow. in determining the future cash flows, city west water takes
into account its current regulated price path to 30 june 2013 as well as the forecast revenue requirement for the subsequent
regulatory period using the esc’s building block approach. a terminal value beyond the forecast period is determined based on
the company’s expected normalised cash flow. the historical written down value of infrastructure assets at 30 june 2012 would
have been $1.151 billion.

27. contingent assets and liabilities
contingent assets
in the ordinary course of business, developers often provide a commitment to city west water to construct water supply and
sewerage assets. these assets are constructed within an agreed timeframe, and upon completion are transferred to city west
water at no charge.
currently there is approximately $5.768m (2010-11 $6.574m) of water supply assets under construction, and a further $4.280m
(2010-11 $5.179m) of water supply assets committed to for which construction is yet to begin. the value of sewerage assets
under construction is approximately $11.237m (2010-11 $14.874m), with a further $4.964m (2010-11 $8.833m) committed
to for which construction is yet to begin. contingent upon the completion of these assets, they will be transferred to city west
water, which will maintain them in perpetuity.

contingent liabilities
contingent on the completion of the above assets, city west water has a liability to reimburse developers an estimated
$3.666m (2010-11 $2.333m) for water supply assets and, $7.554m (2010-11 $10.790m) for sewerage assets for additional
works constructed at city west water’s request. these reimbursements will occur either immediately on the completion of the
assets or be deferred for an agreed period in accordance with the conditions of the agreement between city west water and
the developer.
as a result of the announcement made by the minister for water on 19 june 2012, desalination plant charges collected during
2011-12 will be returned to customers through a price freeze in 2012-13. this will impact revenues reported in 2012-13. in
accordance with the subsequent announcement made by the minister for water on 6 july 2012, past customers that will not
benefit from the price freeze will instead be able to apply for a refund. at reporting date the company was not able to determine
the number of customers or timing of these payments.

expected rate of return on plan assets
the expected return on assets assumption is determined by weighting the expected long term return for each asset class by
the target allocation of assets to each asset class and allowing for the correlations of the investment returns between asset
classes. the returns used for each asset class are net of investment tax and investment fees. an allowance for administration
expenses has also been deducted from the expected return.

notes to and forming part of the financial statements

for the year ended 30 june 2012

31. economic dependency
the normal trading activities of city west water depend to a significant extent on services relating to the acquisition of water and
disposal of sewage currently supplied by the melbourne water corporation. during the financial year 2011-12 all drinking water
supplies were sourced through this organisation and the majority of city west water’s sewage disposals were made through the
same organisation. as no alternative suppliers currently exist, this dependency is expected to continue into the future.
as required by the victorian legislation, city west water’s borrowings are sourced solely from the treasury corporation
of victoria.
