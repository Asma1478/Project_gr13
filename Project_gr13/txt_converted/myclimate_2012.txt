one highlight: the climate pioneer celebration in ­november
2011, where the solar impulse pioneers bertrand piccard and
andré borschberg along with swisscom honoured young cli-
mate pioneers. in addition, the climate audio trail in zermatt
is now being replicated all across switzerland. also the co-
operation with companies bears fruits: the carbon manage-
ment services department has calculated carbon footprints
of hundreds of products and companies, labelled climate
friendly products and consulted companies about how to
work more efficient and reduce their carbon footprint at the
same time.

companies stop short. whilst everyone agrees: something
needs to be done to combat the increasing greenhouse gas
emissions. the declarations of intent and fine words are ­often
not put into concrete actions. the responsibility and the im-
plementation are passed on. an example of this is the slug-
gish process of the international negotiations on a climate
protection agreement designed to replace the kyoto proto-
col, which will expire in 2013.


but there is another way: the foundation ­myclimate is mak-
ing an important contribution to climate protection through
its daily work. it shows what every individual person and
company can contribute to climate protection: through in-
forming and sensitising as part of the climate education pro-
gramme, the next generation will learn how greenhouse gas
emissions can be avoided. national projects provide examples
of how new technologies can reduce emissions. for unavoid-         © didier martenet
able greenhouse gas emissions, ­myclimate offers the oppor-
tunity to offset these through investments in carbon offset
projects. “avoid – reduce – offset” is consequently one of the
principles the foundation stands for. this principle must also
apply at international and national level. time is short. every
country must fulfil this responsibility and tread the path to-
wards a climate friendly economy. the goal must be a broadly
supported, just climate regime. for this, we require clear rules
and legally binding national target values on emission reduc-
tions or emission control.

in autumn 2002, ­myclimate was officially established as an
association with its first branch office in zurich. shortly after
being founded, ­myclimate became an official spin-off of the
eth zurich and thus gained access, among other things, to
the infrastructure of the eth zurich. the year 2005 brought
a merger with the clipp foundation (the climate protection
partnership) to form the foundation ­myclimate – the ­climate
protection partnership.

impressed by the work on these climate projects. one auto-

learned that it is possible to make a significant contribution
to improving our climate with just small changes or modifica-

since the end of 2011, customers of the swiss active holiday
provider baumeler reisen are able to book completely climate
neutral holidays. the voluntary co2 offsetting extends be-

other tourist services at the travel destination. the entire co2
emissions are calculated individually for each baumeler holiday.


the offer has proved very popular since its introduction: to
date, around 80 per cent of travellers have booked a climate
neutral holiday. this high number illustrates that climate neu-
tral travel is currently extremely popular.
