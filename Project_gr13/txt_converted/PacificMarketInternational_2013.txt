pmi joinese waste reduction
pmi joinease, pmi’s joint venture factory in southern china, has worked to reduce
waste generation in all aspects of its operations. several years ago, pmi joinease started
looking at its waste stream as an opportunity for improvement. the first step was to
increase the material efficiency of production, thereby reducing the amount of raw
materials needed and scrap material produced.
                     as a second step, pmi joinease invested in an on-site waste sorting
                     facility where employees sort scrap materials to be recycled, sold
                     and landfilled to increase the diversion rate. in 2012, pmi joinease
                     achieved a 91% waste diversion rate at its facility. the factory’s focus
                     on material efficiency and waste minimization has decreased raw
                     material and disposal costs and created a new revenue stream from          learn more about the environmental initiatives at
the sale of recyclable waste. waste diversion, which provides both top and bottom-line          pmi joinease, and see the video on our corporate
results, continues to be a priority for pmi joinease.                                           social responsibility page: www.pmi-worldwide.

the sustain® story
journey of a breakthrough product
guided by the environmental stewardship embedded
in pmi’s corporate strategy, an internal pmi task force was
formed to create a breakthrough product that would enable
consumers to reduce their environmental footprint. starting
as a system concept, the cup that we know today as sustain®
was delivered in 2012.
pmi performed an internal life cycle assessment (lca)
of the sustain® 16 oz. cup with the support of quantis
software. the lca found that, after 30 uses, the sustain®
cup has a 50% less environmental impact than 30 equivalent
single-use paper cups.
the graph below shows the environmental impact of a
sustain® 16 oz. cup relative to a single use 16 oz. paper cup.
