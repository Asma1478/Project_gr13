customers. during the first half of the year we renewed our coope-

dos opens up an important path for us to the b2b healthcare market.
it also boosts our range of services for healthcare operators, which is
growing according to plan.

in august we announced our updated strategy, new operating
model and long-term financial targets. to support our strategy,
investments were made to increase our operational efficiency and
strengthen our market position. oriola-kd’s board of directors

in 2015 oriola-kd’s business was divided into two
business segments: pharmaceutical trade in sweden
and pharmaceutical trade in finland and the baltic
countries.

pharmaceutical trade in sweden
• profitability of the swedish retail business was supported by
  growth in sales of otc pharmaceuticals and consumer health
  products, and management of the cost structure.
• operating profit was adversely affected by a significant decline in
  parallel imports and pharmaceutical price reductions implement-
  ed by the swedish authorities in the fourth quarter of 2014 and
  second quarter of 2015.
• increased sales of new and expensive prescription medicines with
  low margins negatively affected the relative profitability of the
  swedish retail business.
• oriola-kd launched a web shop in sweden on 16 september 2015
  as planned.
• in 2015 oriola-kd opened 5 new kronans apotek pharmacies in
  sweden. oriola-kd had a total of 309 pharmacies at the end of
  2015.
• otc and consumer health products made up 26(27%) of total sales
  at the end of 2015.
• new agreements with pharmaceutical companies made in 2014
  and improved efficiency supported the positive performance of
  the swedish wholesale business.
• during the first quarter oriola-kd renewed cooperation agree-
  ments for purchasing and logistics with apoteksgruppen and
  lloyds.
