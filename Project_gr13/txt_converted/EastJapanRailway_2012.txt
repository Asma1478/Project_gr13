thriving with communities,
growing globally

the great east japan earthquake on march 11, 2011 caused devastating damage in the jr east group’             s service area
and to its railway facilities. owing to our comprehensive safety measures, there were no injuries to the passengers
on board our trains. however, in some cases this was also due to good fortune, which helped us to appreciate that
there is more to be done to be better prepared against future disasters. following the earthquake, together with the
great support of related parties and the ceaseless efforts of each and every jr east group employee, jr east was
able to overcome the many challenges and restore its railway facilities. each time we reopened a section of railway,
we were able to see the joy and appreciation on the faces of the people. in particular, when the tohoku shinkansen
resumed full operation on the 50th day following the disaster, a great many people lined the tracks waving and
cheering the return of the train. i am sure that i will never forget that scene for the rest of my life.
through the disaster, each one of our employees was able to recognize anew their bonds with local communities
and the great expectations that society holds for our railway company. as a company responsible for railways as
social infrastructure, we have once again realized the importance of fulfilling our missions as a railway company, and
                                                        in responding to the expectations of society.
                                                        still, due to the great east japan earthquake, our business
                                                        environment has changed drastically and there is still much to be
                                                        done in order to fully recover from the earthquake. in addition
                                                        to nationwide shortages in electricity and the uncertain future
                                                        of the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station, the european
                                                        financial crisis and the prolonged appreciation of the yen against
                                                        the dollar have further obscured the future path of the japanese
                                                        economy and society. prior to the earthquake, japan was
                                                        already facing several difficult challenges, including a declining
                                                        birthrate, an aging population, and a hollowing-out of domestic
                                                        industry. following the disaster, the direction of these challenges
                                                        became more severe than ever before, and it continues to
                                                        become clearer as the momentum of change increases.
                                                        in such a time of rapid reform, jr east needs to remain
                                                        constantly moving forward into the future in order to continue to
                                                        respond to the great expectations of society. with this at heart,
                                                        jr east considers march 11, 2011 to be the company’        s second
                                                        starting point, with the first being the privatization of jnr. it is
                                                        now necessary that we once again ask ourselves what the roles
                                                        and goals of the jr east group are, and what is needed for the
                                                        company to evolve.
                                                        based on this realization, in october 2012, jr east formulated
                                                        its 5th management vision since the foundation of the company,
                                                       “management vision v - ever onward”         . with the main pillars
                                                        of this vision set in our firm commitment to fulfill our“eternal

                                                        and in japan as a whole.

quality of these services.
first, for measures to achieve unsurpassed levels of safety, jr east has commenced seismic reinforcement measures
totaling 300 billion yen in preparation for a possible earthquake occurring directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan
area. at the same time, jr east has also been taking other measures to increase its standing as an increasingly
disaster-resilient railway, including measures to strengthen its resilience to natural disasters and abnormal weather.
in addition, plans to install platform doors on the yamanote line were pushed forward. some stations planning large-
scale renovations are not yet included, but this project will be completed for 23 stations by fy2016. jr east will also
work with the related organizations for stations on lines other than the yamanote line for the future installation of
platform doors in those stations.
second, to further thrive as a corporate group loved by both customers and communities, jr east is working to
become no.1 in customer satisfaction in the railway industry through service quality reforms and teamwork. jr

improvements to transport quality, enhancements to the tokyo metropolitan area network through the opening
of the tohoku through line, improvements to services on the tokyo mega loop, and through the opening of the
hokuriku shinkansen kanazawa station and the hokkaido shinkansen shin-hakodate station (both names are
tentative).
as a company responsible for local infrastructure, jr east desires to further strengthen its coalitions with local
communities. based on the pressing need for disaster restoration, jr east is focused on measures for the
revitalization and promotion of local areas which can only be accomplished by the jr east group. specifically,
we aim to continue tourism campaigns in coalition with local communities, and to support the manufacture of
local products through the sales network and know-how of the jr east group. in addition, in promoting urban
development through the development of large-scale terminal stations, giving our line –side areas a reputation that
is high among people in the tokyo metropolitan area, and the revitalization of regional core cities, jr east aims to
establish stations as places of exchange for local people and as entrances to cities and communities.


pursuing the unlimited potential of the jr east group
in order to achieve sustainable growth in this time of drastic change following the disaster, we need to avoid
complacency and to continue to challenge ourselves with new goals. for this reason, jr east remains determined to
challenge new fields in order to tap the unlimited potential of the jr east group and each one of its employees. jr
east aims to actively pursue new business fields through the promotion of strategies for energy and the environment,
the utilization of information and communication technology (ict), increases in the speed of its shinkansen,
technological innovations for the evolution of railways, participation in overseas railway projects, and the expansion
of its railcar manufacturing operations. in support of these measures, jr east seeks to create numerous opportunities
for its motivated employees to assume active roles and create their own challenges, to establish corporate cultures
open to those outside of the group, and to foster globally-minded individuals.


toward the realization of a sustainable society : our ceaseless efforts to address
global environmental issues
the jr east group considers global environmental issues to be one of its most important management concerns.
through various environmental conservation measures to date, including the introduction of energy-saving railcars
and a shift to led lighting, jr east has been able to achieve steady reductions in its total co2 emissions and in the
environmental burden of its railway operations. however, owing to the 2011 disaster, we are currently facing a new
business challenge, an electricity shortage which is forecast to continue into the foreseeable future. additionally,
though in the past railways have been viewed as an environmentally friendly mode of transportation and have been
evaluated highly for their environmental superiority, with recent significant advancements in the environmental
technologies of other fields such as the automobile industry, we have a strong sense that in the near future there
might come a time when railways may not be seen as such.
in order to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society and to maintain the environmental superiority of
railways, advancements in the field of environmental technology are inevitable. jr east must both strengthen its
environmental measures and remain steadfast in its commitment to lead in the advancement of environmental
technologies in japan.

specifically, jr east aims to promote measures from a number of viewpoints, including the commercialization of
a storage battery-driven electric railcar system, the introduction of smart grid technologies to the jr east group’ s
railway power system, and the expanded introduction of renewable energies. moreover, in promoting the
development of“ecoste”to introduce various environmental preservation technologies to stations, jr east will create
one model station for each of the 12 jr east branch offices in its service area. two of these, yotsuya station on the
chuo line and hiraizumi station on the tohoku main line, have been completed. with the ultimate aim of realizing a
sustainable society, jr east is committed to actively addressing global environmental issues over the long term.

as 25 years have passed since the jnr privatization reform and the foundation of jr east, the jr east group now
begins its next quarter century. jr east will enter this new era following its new policy,“management vision v - ever
onward”   , a policy based on our shared theme of thriving with communities, growing globally.

                  infrastructures in the eastern
                  japan area
a year and a half of restoration and reconstruction following the great east japan earthquake

our future measures against earthquakes
learning from the experiences of the great hanshin-awaji earthquake of january 1995, the sanriku
minami earthquake of may 2003, and the mid niigata prefecture earthquake of october 2004, jr east
has introduced seismic reinforcement measures to its elevated bridge columns, bridge piers, tunnels, and
station buildings, taken preventive measures against derailments, and increased the number of locations
where seismometers are installed.
owing to these measures, at the time of the great east japan earthquake on march 11, 2011, no
customers on board our trains were killed or injured.
since fy2010, jr east has expanded its countermeasures and initiated the 2nd phase of its seismic
reinforcement measures, including further seismic reinforcement of its elevated bridge columns. in
addition, jr east plans to introduce the following as further measures against earthquakes.


       ① seismic reinforcement measures for embankments, earth cuttings, arched elevated brick bridges,
          and power poles, and measures to prevent the collapse of station platform ceilings and walls in the
          event that an earthquake directly strikes the tokyo metropolitan area. jr east will also accelerate
          the implementation of its plans for the on-going seismic reinforcement of its elevated bridge piers.
       ② seismic reinforcement measures for station buildings where the number of boarding and alighting
          passengers exceeds 3,000 persons per day, and for shinkansen power poles, many of which were
          damaged by the great east japan earthquake.
       ③ strengthened anti-disaster telecommunication functions, including an increase in the transmission
          speed of seismometer measurement data, and the reinforcement of its emergency power sources
          for its communication network.



jr east is committed to the promotion of these seismic reinforcement measures for at least the next
five years, and to continuation of its efforts to bring further improvements to the disaster resilience of its
railways.

measures for tsunami evacuation
prior to the occurrence of the great east japan earthquake, jr east had designated tsunami hazard areas
and set rules for operational restrictions for each of its service areas, formulating manuals and conducting
drills to guide the escape of passengers from trains. after the great east japan earthquake, jr east
reviewed all of its rules, manuals, and drill. in consideration of our findings, jr east decided upon the
following measures.


  ① a reexamination of our tsunami warning zones based on hazard maps of municipalities and tsunami
     flooded areas resulting from the great east japan earthquake.
  ② a reexamination of our rules for operational restrictions in the case of a tsunami warning.
  ③ the formulation of a set of guidelines as a fundamental method for guiding passengers in tsunami
     evacuation.
  ④ a plan to increase the number of locations of evacuation route maps and signage at and between
     stations.
  ⑤ a joint project with local municipalities to install emergency stairs to evacuation shelters and
     signage to indicate escape routes.
  ⑥ a review and revision of tsunami handling manuals for locations at risk.
  ⑦ a plan to conduct annual regular training and drills around the anniversary date of march 11.

conducting drills and providing support to people with difficulties in returning home
when train service was interrupted at the time of the great east japan earthquake, stations were
crowded with a large number of customers. in future instances, after confirming the safety of our facilities,
jr east will keep passenger restrooms and public phones open and available at stations in the tokyo
metropolitan area, provide customers with as much information as it can, and offer temporary shelter
spaces at approximately 200 stations. moreover, at approximately 30 major terminal stations, including
tokyo and shinjuku stations, jr east is now storing stockpiles of supplies including drinking water,
blankets, and first-aid kits for children and the elderly.
furthermore, at shibuya and chiba stations on september 1, 2011, and at tokyo, shinjuku, and ikebukuro
stations on february 3, 2012, jr east conducted joint drills with the local municipalities to increase our
ability to support people experiencing difficulty in returning to their homes in the event of a disaster.
together with local municipalities, jr east is working to share pertinent issues with the public, and to be
better prepared in the event of a disaster.

measures to support the restoration of disaster-damaged areas in fy2012
jr east marketed the jr east pass in 2011 to support travel to the disaster-damaged areas for restoration,
personal visits, and homecoming, and to assist in the revitalization of sightseeing destinations in the
disaster-damaged areas. in addition, in an effort to utilize the vitality generated from aomori prefecture to
help revive the sightseeing destinations of the tohoku region, and to lend spirit to the country as a whole,
6 jr companies, together with aomori prefecture, began the aomori destination campaign on april 23,
2011. the 6 companies have since continued their joint campaigns, including connecting japan – smiling
faces of travelers to energize tohoku – and go! tohoku, in promoting measures to increase travel to
the tohoku area. moreover, jr east has donated part of its revenue generated from the sales of tohoku
shinkansen granclass tickets and travel products to the tohoku area as relief support.

also, in the immediate aftermath of the great east japan earthquake, jr east began selling groceries at
the shop fronts of s-pal sendai and excel mito in the disaster damaged areas. in the tokyo metropolitan
area, at ueno and other stations, to further support the disaster damaged areas, jr east also held support
tohoku fresh markets and tohoku product and craftwork fairs. at these events, while presenting the
attractiveness of each disaster-affected prefecture, jr east sold vegetables, processed products, and
traditional craftwork from each of the tohoku areas.
group companies related to the life-style business continue to support the restoration of the disaster-
affected areas through such volunteer activities as soup kitchens, donations of relief money through sales,
and the creation of menus using food ingredients from the areas.

restoration measures for disaster-affected areas
currently, we are coordinating our efforts to restore conventional lines along the northeastern pacific coast
that were severely damaged by the tsunami, with additional plans to rebuild the area as a whole and
develop towns, and have been engaged in discussions with the relevant national and local government
authorities regarding these initiatives. to date, service has resumed along the entire hachinohe line and
in sections of the joban line, senseki line and other lines, and we plan to replace the tsunami-destroyed
track on the senseki line between takagimachi and rikuzen-ono, the joban line between soma and
watari, and the ishinomaki line between watanoha and urashuku. as an interim method of restoring
safe transportation services, on august 20, 2012 we established brt (bus rapid transit service) along the
kesennuma line, and are considering brt and various other proposals for the yamada line and ofunato
line. meanwhile we are serving local customers by operating bus routes to temporarily replace the lines
that remain out of service.
as part of our work for restoration of the tsunami-damaged railway lines, jr east has been coordinating
efforts between local municipalities and the related departments of its head office and branch offices.
having reviewed our support structure for a year, we established the reconstruction planning department
at corporate planning headquarters on may 1, 2012 in order to further strengthen and promote more
comprehensive measures for restoration.
currently, the reconstruction planning department is working in coalition with related organizations and
local municipalities to restore the damaged coastal railway lines.

                   10 years of research and
                   development

10th anniversary of the establishment of the research & development center of jr east group
the research & development center of jr east group celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation
in december 2011. at the time of its foundation, the center began with two new organizations: the
frontier service development laboratory and the advanced railway system development center, and
two previously established ones: the safety research laboratory and the technical center. in 2006, the
center newly established the disaster prevention research laboratory, and in 2009, the environmental
engineering research laboratory. in this section, we introduce the major achievements of the research &
development center of jr east group to date.


1. development of environmental technology
（1）research and development aimed at the reduction of our environmental impact

ne train, jr east’  s test railcar, was the first to introduce a hybrid system to a railway. the next step in
reducing the railcar’  s environmental impact was to replace the ne train’   s engine and generator with fuel
cells, remodeling the ne train as a fuel cell hybrid railcar. in fy2008, jr east conducted test runs of this
fuel cell hybrid railcar on the shin-etsu main line.
in fy2010, jr east commenced test runs of its high-capacity storage battery-equipped ne train, smart
denchi-kun. smart denchi-kun which consumes less energy than diesel railcars has advantages as a
reduction in co2 emissions and zero exhaust gas. in february and march 2012, in the final stage of its
testing, jr east conducted test runs for the charge-discharge of its battery system on the non-electrified
karasuyama line and confirmed that the system had no problems with practical performance.

（2）research and development aimed at increased speed for the shinkansen

① development of rolling stock

with the fastech360, a shinkansen high-speed test train manufactured with the objective of increasing
the operational speed of the shinkansen, the center has been working on technological developments
to accommodate wayside environments, such as measures against noise and micro-pressure waves (air
compression waves generated when trains enter tunnels at a high speed). the results obtained from this
research are reflected in the e5 series, which is used for tohoku shinkansen hayabusa trains, and are
planned to have an increased operational speed of 320km/h after the end of fy2014. in the future, the
center aims to continue its research and development in order to achieve further speed increases for its
shinkansen.

② development of ground facilities

in aiming for speed increases for the shinkansen, jr east has pursued measures to reduce micro-pressure
waves and noise at its ground facilities.
to reduce the micro-pressure waves, jr east developed and introduced reduced length tunnel hoods
by installing the duct into the hood, tunnel hoods made of lightweight panels, and a shinkansen noise
reduction device (nides) which is installed in the upper part of soundproof walls as a countermeasure for
noise.

2. research and development related to safety
（1）measures against earthquakes

as countermeasures against earthquakes, jr east has pursued measures to heighten the quake-resistance
of its structures, to stop trains as quickly as possible when an earthquake strikes, and to greatly reduce
the amount of damage resulting from an earthquake.
in particular, jr east has developed and introduced a seismic reinforcement measures to help counter
earthquakes through the introduction of reinforced concrete components to the side surfaces of bridge
columns, l-shaped car guides to prevent shinkansen trains from going to the side if they derail at the time
of an earthquake, and countermeasures to prevent rails from overturning.

（2）human error analysis method

jr east developed the 4m4e analysis method in 2004 to analyze human error-related accidents. the
4m4e method includes a 4m (man, machine, media, and management) cause-tracing analysis to
investigate the origins of accidents multilaterally and a 4e (education, engineering, environment, and
enforcement) solution-tracing analysis to improve countermeasures. in further efforts, jr east developed
the naze naze kun (mr. why-and-why) learning materials for personal computers, and the horisage kun
(mr. in-depth study) analysis support tool. both were introduced in fy2006 for the analysis of events
requiring attention, and utilized for the prevention of accidents and improvements to safety.

（3）operational restriction methods

for operational restrictions during heavy rainfall, jr east has traditionally utilized a calculation that
combines the rainfall for the preceding hour and the total continuous rainfall since the start of the rain.
however, to more effectively identify danger levels associated with disasters resulting from rainfall, jr east
analyzed effective rainfall through changes in water levels, utilizing a tank which modeled how rainwater
penetrated into the ground and rainwater outflow. through the statistical analysis of past rainfall and
disaster data, and by utilizing 3 kinds of effective rainfall with half-life periods of 1.5 hours, 6 hours, and
24 hours as indices, it became possible to evaluate the potential danger for various rainfall disasters. and,
since june 2008, this system has been introduced to all conventional lines as part of their operational
restriction procedures.

3. research and development for improvements in customer service
in an effort to provide easy-to-understand operations-related information for customers in the event of
transport disturbances, between 2002 and 2006, jr east developed passenger guidance emergency
information displays for the visual display of route maps. the displays indicate routes with delayed train
operations in orange, and those with suspended train operations in red. in this way, passengers can
immediately and visually comprehend the status of train operations in the event of a disruption. following
field tests at ueno station and tokyo station, the system was installed at akihabara station in february of
2007, and is currently being introduced to other stations as well, mainly in the tokyo metropolitan area.
in addition, jr east is currently developing an on-board personalized information provision system to
provide customers real-time information of their actual location through smartphones. with this system,
customers can obtain a variety of detailed information according to their needs and, at the same time,
their activities after alighting can also be supported. in 2011, jr east field tested a commercial trainset on
the yamanote line, and aims to commercialize the system after conducting user questionnaires to assess
and to verify the services to be provided.

 waste disposal
 ・waste includes salable waste.
 ・recycling includes thermal recycling* where general and industrial wastes are incinerated with heat recovery.
 * thermal recycling: a recycling method in which the heat arising from the incineration of waste is used to create steam and warm water, which in turn are used to generate electricity
   and hot-water

new environmental targets
at jr east, as part of steadily carrying out our environmental activities, we set not only medium- and long-
term targets, but also numerical targets for each category of environmental preservation effort. with the
completion of the last target period, we have now established new targets and will strive continuously to
meet them.

concepts in setting new targets
● [targets to be met by fy2021] 8% reduction in energy consumption from railway business activities
   (mj : relative to the fy2011 level)
jr east has striven to improve efficiency in energy use with energy-efficient railcars, etc. targets for total
co2 emissions, however, have been affected by fluctuations in the coefficients of co2 emissions of the
electric power companies from which jr east purchased electricity, and it had been difficult to measure
the results of our own efforts. jr east then set targets whereby its efforts to reduce energy consumption
could be reflected better and be less affected by changing external environments.

● [targets to be met by fy2021] 30% improvement in co2 emissions per unit of electricity generated at
   jr east’  s own power plants (kg-co2/kwh : relative to fy1991 level)
at jr east’   s thermal power plants, efforts have been made to reduce co 2 emissions by transforming
facilities into“combined cycle generating systems,”fuel conversions and other actions. jr east is propping
up such efforts with this new target.
* the two targets above replace the existing target for fy2018. target for fy2031 will be addressed while ascertaining the direction of
   japan's energy policy and others.


● [target for fy2014] 6.8% reduction in electricity used for railway operations per unit of transport
   volume (kwh/car-km : relative to fy2007 level)
jr east used to set targets for“energy-efficient railcar utilization rates”and“electricity used for train
operations”in addition to“electricity used for railway operations per unit of transport volume.”as a result
of increased use of energy-efficient railcars, total power consumption is being decreased and, accordingly,
so is energy consumption per car-km. these two targets have now been integrated into“electricity used
for railway operations per unit of transport volume.”

● [target for fy2014] 3% reduction in energy consumption per unit of floor area at branch offices, etc.
   (kl-crude oil equivalent/m2 : relative to fy2011 level)
the target of“energy saving at stations and offices”was set to understand and reduce total energy used
at stations, branch office buildings, etc. the target set this time is for energy consumption at“factories,
etc.,”as used in the law on rational use of energy (the energy saving law), and jr east will promote
reduction of energy consumed at its head office and branch offices accordingly.

● [target for fy2014] recycling rates for various kinds of waste
for recycling of waste, although a rate of over 90% has already been achieved, jr east will promote the
3rs – reduce, reuse and recycle – toward realization of a recycling-oriented society without lowering
numerical targets.

● [target for fy2014] 100% green procurement (group target)
in the past, numerical targets for goods, etc., were limited to office paper and thus the“recycled office
paper utilization rate”was established in 1996. currently, however,“green procurement”is the favored
approach within society. the jr east group thus sets this green procurement target for environmentally
friendly goods and materials used within the group. specifically, whether or not group companies
purchased goods, materials or services according to the basic policy provided in article 6 of the“law
on promotion of procurement of eco-friendly goods and services by the state and other entities (green
purchasing law)”  is used as an indicator. in parallel with this, each group company establishes guidelines
for goods, materials and services, how to deal with them, etc.

● [ target for fiscal 2016] noise measures targeting 75 db or less along the tohoku and joetsu
   shinkansen lines (for areas subject to noise measures)
as for noise measures along shinkansen lines, measures to reduce noise to 75 db or less have been
completed in the designated areas in accordance with government guidance. currently, improvement
work is being implemented step by step in other areas to be completed by the end of march 2016.

● implementation of specific environmental protection activities every year (group target)
targets have not been set for fy2014. this is because individual companies in the jr east group are
regularly involved in various environmental protection activities in response to society’   s increasing
awareness of global environmental issues.

measures to prevent global warming
 trends in co2 emissions☆
 our co2 emissions in the fiscal year ending march 2012 totaled 1.88 million tons, a decrease of 0.27
 million tons over the previous fiscal year. this was due to the restart of our own hydroelectric power
 plant, which resulted in the reduction of the operating rate of our own thermal power plant and eventually
 in the reduction of co2 emissions from it. it was also attributable to energy-saving efforts throughout the
 company.

energy conservation and co2 reduction☆
the electricity consumed by jr east for train operations as well as for lighting and air conditioning at
stations and in offices is supplied by jr east’    s own power plants and by electric power companies.
besides electricity, we also use diesel fuel and kerosene for diesel train operation and for air conditioning
at stations and in offices. we will strive to save energy for train operation, which accounts for about 70%
of our total energy consumption, and reduce co2 emissions in various ways.

reducing energy consumed for train operations☆
as of the end of march 2012, jr east had 11,205 energy-efficient railcars in operation. this accounts for
89.5% of our railcar fleet. we are putting into service more new-generation energy efficient railcars, with
features such as regenerative brakes, which can convert kinetic energy during deceleration into electric
energy, and variable voltage variable frequency (vvvf) inverters, which control motors without wasting
electricity.

diesel-powered, electric-motor-driven hybrid railcars and new resort trains
the kiha e200 type cars, which entered service on the koumi line in july 2007, are the world’       s first
diesel-powered, electric-motor-driven hybrid railcars. compared with the current trains, fuel consumption
rate has been reduced by about 10% and the noise level of the trains idling at stations and accelerating
on departure has been lowered by 20–30 db. also, in october to december 2010 we began operating
the hb-e300 series, a new type of resort train equipped with a hybrid system similar to kiha e200 type, in
the nagano, aomori and akita areas.

 jr east operates a thermal power plant in kawasaki city, kanagawa prefecture, with a total capacity of
 655 mw. the plant will reduce co2 emissions by replacing three units (out of four) with combined-cycle
 power generation units* with improved efficiency and by switching fuel from oil to natural gas when the
 plant is renovated.                                          1 0.55                                                                                                                                                                                                250

 we also promote use of renewable energies, including solar and wind power. solar panels were installed
 at tokyo station, takasaki station, the general education center and r&d center. in march 2004, the
 number of panels at takasaki station was doubled. panels on the largest scale in jr east were installed at
 tokyo station in february 2011 above the platform for tracks 9 and 10, which serve tokaido line trains.
 starting full operations as the first ecoste –“eco-station”– yotsuya station on the jr chuo line began use
 of solar panels in march 2012. hiraizumi station on the jr east tohoku main line, the second ecoste,
 began to use solar panels in june 2012, to“generate and use energy locally”and to realize“zero
 emissions,”i.e., no co 2 emissions on fine-weather days. we will continue to endeavor to introduce
 technology using renewable energies efficiently.

greening rooftops
we have been promoting the planting of greenery on jr east-owned station and office building rooftops
with the aim of reducing the heat island effect and decreasing the need for air-conditioning. as of the end
of march 2012, we had“greened”a combined rooftop area of approximately 20,074 m2 in 62 projects.

rooftop greening by jr group companies
we have been promoting rooftop greening to make station buildings in the metropolitan area a place of
relaxation for the residents of the community as well as for office workers. the“soradofarm,”which is a
vegetable farm rented to subscribers and built alongside the gardens, serves to create a local community,
and provide education in farming and environment through people’    s experience in cultivating vegetables.
it is popular among many customers and these are now also in ebisu, ogikubo and takasaki.

saving energy in office buildings
in response to revisions to laws and regulations, saving energy in office buildings has become increasingly
important. we work hard on reducing energy consumption through physical measures, including the
introduction of highly efficient equipment and facilities, and operational measures, including temperature
management of air conditioning and diligently turning off lights.
in addition, given the concerns about energy supply and demand since the great east japan earthquake,
we have been actively introducing led lighting apparatus, which is particularly effective as a physical
measure.

recognition as global warming countermeasures establishments
gran tokyo south tower, gran tokyo north tower and the jr shinagawa east building were newly
recognized on february 17, 2012, as global warming countermeasures establishments (commonly
referred to as top-level establishments or quasi-top-level establishments) under the tokyo metropolitan
environmental preservation ordinance in recognition of their highly efficient facilities, active management
efforts for energy conservation, and commendable co 2 reduction results. jr shinagawa east building
was raised to a top-level establishment from a quasi-top-level establishment. together with sapia tower,
jr tokyu meguro building and tokyo building, all recognized last year, six of our buildings have been
recognized as global warming countermeasures establishments.
the jr minami-shinjuku building and jr kanda-manseibashi building, office buildings to be completed this
fiscal year (which ends on march 31, 2013), are also environmentally and energy friendly. on march 2,
2012, the jr kanda-manseibashi building was ranked“s,”the top rank in the comprehensive assessment
system for built environment efficiency (casbee), a system put forward at the initiative of the ministry of
land, infrastructure and transport (mlit).

saving energy used by information systems
as part of our effort to save energy in office buildings since fy2010, we have been turning off power for
certain information systems equipment during non-use hours. the resulting savings were about 140,000
kwh of power in fy2012, which is especially important with the tight energy supply-and-demand situation
since the earthquake in 2011. we also reduced the number of servers by combining equipment, worked
to introduce energy-saving products and set our business-use pc terminals to power saving mode. we
will continue our efforts to reduce energy consumption further.

                 led lighting installed on yamanote line
                 beginning in december 2010, led lighting ‒ jointly
                 developed by jr east group companies ‒ was
                 installed in eleven e231-series cars on the
                 yamanote line on an experimental basis, for tests
                 of in-car brightness and led durability. we will
                 use led lighting for all e233-series cars to be
                 introduced on the saikyo and yokohama lines
                 in and after fiscal 2014. in this way, energy
                 consumption is expected to be reduced by about
                 40% compared with conventional fluorescent
                 lights. jr east will continue its train operations
                 using cars even more advanced in their friendliness
                 to the environment.

promoting park-and-ride
jr east promotes“park-and-ride”services. customers with tickets for the shinkansen or limited express
trains can drive their cars from home to nearby stations and use the train network from there. by the
end of march 2012, 90 jr east stations had parking spaces for ten thousand cars*. this not only spares
customers the delays of traffic congestion, but conveys them reliably to their destination through a more
environmentally friendly form of travel.
* parking spaces for ten thousand cars at 90 stations: parking spaces include those developed by jr east, and those managed by jr east
   group companies or in cooperation with local municipalities.




                                       at 10 stations between tomobe and iwaki on the joban line,
                                       parking charges are free for express train customers going
                                       farther than a specified distance.



promoting rail-and-car
to suggest to our customers travel plans that use a combination of railways and automobiles, jr east has
been offering a car rental service called“train-ta-kun”since 1995, with discounted rental charges. we
are facilitating intermodal transportation* by introducing new classes of automobiles, such as light cars,
offering attractive rates, and installing car navigation systems and electronic toll collection as standard
equipment on rental cars.
* intermodal transportation: intermodal transportation refers to a transportation system which allows a person to get from an origin point to
   a final destination by connecting between different modes of transportation.

measures to create a sound material cycle
waste reduction and recycling
jr east generates many kinds of waste through its railway operations, including daily trash removed from
trains and stations and industrial waste from our general rolling stock centers. in addition, restaurants
and retail stores in our life-style businesses produce garbage and general waste. in order to reduce all
these various forms of waste, jr east actively supports the approach known as“reduce, reuse, recycle.”
for recycling in particular, goals are set for each type of waste.


recycling waste collected from stations and trains☆
in the fiscal year ending march 2012 the ratio of trash from stations and trains that were recycled was
93%. (beginning in the fiscal year ending march 2008 thermal recycling was considered. also, definitions
were partly changed in the fiscal year ending march 2010.) since trash from stations and trains contains
recyclable materials, we first placed separation bins in stations. we then established recycling centers in
ueno, omiya and shinkiba for more rigorous separation. in october 2010, to further improve recycling
rates, we consolidated the recycling centers in ueno and shinkiba and built the jr east tokyo materials
recycling center (operated by east japan eco access co., ltd.).

recycling initiatives at general rolling stock centers, etc.☆
jr east group is recycling waste generated during the manufacture and maintenance of rolling stock. at
the niitsu rolling stock manufacturing factory, we promote waste reduction and recycling, taking into
account the railcars’entire life cycle starting at the time of designing. at our regional general rolling stock
centers, waste is sorted into 20 to 30 categories to reduce waste generation and promote recycling.
starting in the fiscal year ending march 2006, we have been collecting data on the volume of retired
railcars that are sold as scrap to be recycled so as to monitor the progress.

reducing construction waste☆
jr east endeavors to reduce waste from construction by requiring subcontractors to use design and
construction methods that allow them to properly dispose of construction byproducts and to minimize
waste. in the fiscal year ending march 2012, jr east generated 430 thousand tons of waste through
construction and maintenance projects at our stations and other structures, including 60 thousand tons of
waste through work entrusted to jr east.*

reducing waste at offices☆
in departments at the head office and branch offices, we strive to reduce waste by promoting elimination
of paper and by recycling, including the use of creative, employee-designed trashcans. in the fiscal year
ending march 2012, we recycled 2,213 out of a total of 2,488 tons of waste (89%).

efficient use of water resources☆
as a consumer of 11.47 million m3 of water annually, jr east actively promotes the use of recycled waste
water*, using, for example, rainwater and water already used for washing hands to flush toilets. at the
head office building, 24 thousand out of 41 thousand m3 of water was reused in the fiscal year ending
march 2012.
* recycled waste water: defined as water of a quality level between clean water and sewage water. it is used for limited purposes as a
   recycled resource.



reducing and recycling tickets.☆
collected used tickets are sent to a paper mill. after the iron powder has been separated from the backs
of the tickets, the paper is recycled to make toilet paper and corrugated cardboard. in the fiscal year
ended march 2012, all of the 363 tons of collected tickets was recycled.
collected magnetic season tickets were recycled into solid fuel.




                                           used tickets collected at stations are recycled into
                                           toilet paper that is used at major stations in the
                                           greater tokyo metropolitan area.

 to further promote green procurement for our office supplies, we have set a target of“100% green
 procurement”for the jr east group as a whole. through this green procurement, the jr east group
 promotes activities to realize a recycling-oriented society.


 recycling trash within the company
 jr east promotes in-company recycling of trash generated at stations.
 magazines, newspapers and similar paper items collected from our segregated trash boxes at stations
 and trains are being recycled into coated paper and stationery and used in our offices.




           newspapers and other papers collected in stations and elsewhere are recycled into office paper used by our
           company.




 recycling waste pet bottles into civil engineering materials
 jr east has constructed a recycling system that produces resin weed-barrier sheets (product name:
 nakusa r-pet) by recycling the pet (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles discarded in stations and trains.
 the main ingredient for resin weed-barrier sheets used to be polyethylene, but jr east has developed and
 commercialized a weed-barrier sheet composed mainly of waste pet bottles after testing has succeeded.

biodiversity
hometown forestation program
in 2004, in order to protect biodiversity and contribute to a sustainable society, while cherishing our
sense of gratitude to nature, we began the hometown forestation programs to plant trees native to each
region and revitalize the forests.
we undertook these programs with the cooperation of fukushima prefecture from 2004 to 2009 and
with the cooperation of niigata prefecture and the town of tsunanmachi in 2010. in addition, in other
areas served by jr east, we are planting trees that are native to the areas and we shall continue to do the
same in the future.

forest development along railway lines☆
beginning in 1992 we have been engaged in tree planting activities along the jr east wayside. by fiscal
2012 a total of 44 thousand people participated in planting about 310 thousand trees. today, we have
gone beyond the wayside and do tree planting in cooperation with the communities.


development of railway trees
along some jr east railway lines, we have railway trees planted to shield the tracks from blowing snow
and wind. the first railway forest was created in 1893 for disaster prevention. as living disaster prevention
facilities, railway forests are playing their roles.
jr east now owns approximately 5.8 million railway trees on a total of about 4,000 hectares along our
lines at approximately 1,200 locations. the trees absorb 16 thousand tons of co2, equivalent to 0.6% of
the co2 that jr east emits. in this way, they also contribute to preserving the environment.
in 2008, after fundamentally reviewing the role of railway trees from the viewpoints both of disaster
prevention and environmental preservation, we launched a new project to plant trees to replace those
that will require replacement over the coming 20 years.

railway trees-from single to multi-variety trees
traditionally, railway trees were of a single variety, primarily cedar trees, because another function, in
addition to protecting against natural disasters, was to generate profits through the production of timber.
this has recently been less successful, however, in the face of declining demand for domestic timber. in
future tree replacement, we will plant several varieties suitable for the local climate and develop them to
be more sustainable and ecologically resilient.

planting new railway trees
ceremonies for the planting of new railway trees were held in the kakizaki no. 1 railway forest between
kakizaki and yoneyama on the shin-etsu main line on september 27, 2008, in the oitama no. 2 forest
on the ou main line between oitama and takahata on july 26, 2009, and in the jinguji no. 2 railway
forest on the ou main line between jinguji and kariwano on may 22nd, 2010. with kind advice and
guidance from ecologist and professor emeritus akira miyawaki of yokohama national university, several
varieties of native trees (potential natural vegetation) were selected and planted. many local residents
and participants from organized tours participated in the ceremonies, and discovered how the trees they
planted would grow to become useful as living railway disaster prevention facilities

basic thoughts on noise reduction
improvement of the environment along railways: basic thoughts on noise reduction
in the operation of trains, noise is created by the train cars moving through the air, by the wheels
travelling on the rails, by the motors, and by other sources. in order to reduce noise, we are working in
various ways to improve both the trains and our ground equipment.
jr east also endeavors to reduce noise during maintenance work on track and structures to further
improve the environment along the lines.


measures for the shinkansen
in accordance with the japanese government’         s environmental quality standards for shinkansen
superexpress railway noise, jr east has taken many steps to reduce this noise, such as the installation
of soundproof walls and sound-absorbent materials, rail grinding*1 and the modification of our railcars to
operate more quietly. we have already completed the implementation of measures to reduce noise levels
to 75 db or lower in densely populated residential areas along our railway lines, and we plan to take
further steps by expanding the scope of areas where noise levels need to be reduced to 75 db or lower.
also, with the introduction of e5 series railcars, which were developed based on the results of running
tests using the shinkansen“fastech”test train, jr east is working to improve the environment even as
we increase train speed, including further reduction of noise and micro-pressure waves in tunnels*2.
    ail grinding: a measure to smooth out uneven places in rails caused by wheels traveling over them. this reduces noise by controlling car
*1 r
   vibration.
*2 micro-pressure waves in tunnels: an explosive sound caused by compressed air being forced.




                                         the e5 series employs low-noise pantographs.



measures for conventional lines
we have implemented voluntary measures for conventional lines to minimize noise, installing long rails*1
and performing rail-grinding and wheel-truing*2. we also comply with the japanese government’  s policy
on noise measures for construction of new conventional railways or large-scale remodeling when we
engage in this kind of construction or modification of our conventional lines.
*1 installing long rails: rail joints are welded such that the length of a single rail becomes more than 200 meters. with fewer rail joints, these
    rails reduce noise produced at joints when trains pass.
*2 w heel truing: a measure to grind the unevenness of wheels caused by wear, to restore their circular shape.



measures for maintenance work
as the maintenance work is usually done during night, we give advance notice about the schedule and
details of the work to residents in surrounding areas. we also make utmost efforts to minimize noise by
using modified equipment that produces lower noise. furthermore, by using track that is designed to
resist deformation, jr east is reducing the volume of required maintenance work.




                                                                        33

improvement of the environment along railway lines
restricting use of herbicides☆
safe train operations require regular removal of weeds along railway lines. while we generally remove
them manually, we also use a certain amount of herbicide. we keep the usage of herbicides to a
minimum in both volume and range of use. when selecting herbicides for use, we select those from the
safest of the three levels of toxicity to humans and animals, and from category a, the safest of the five
levels of toxicity to fish.
we continue to observe the rules in place in order to keep our impact on the surrounding environment
to a minimum, as with our initiative to postpone the spraying of herbicides when conditions on the
scheduled day are not satisfactory for spraying. in fy 2012, 203 tons of herbicides were used.


harmony with the landscape
given that construction of a large-scale railway facility or its remodeling greatly affects the local area
and surrounding environment, jr east endeavors to harmonize its completed facilities with surrounding
landscapes and natural environments. in the fiscal year ended in march 2012, the agatsumagawa bridge
no. 3 received the tanaka award (for excellent bridge work or bridge engineering) from the japan
society of civil engineers, in recognition of a landscape in harmony with the surrounding environment and
the national road parallel to the bridge. our efforts are indeed well recognized outside of the company.

chemical substance management
compliance with laws and setting goals for reduction of chemical substances
when using chemical substances, the effects on human health and ecological systems must be fully
considered. the jr east group not only rigidly adheres to established standard values, but sets its
own ambitious targets as well. as much as possible, we restrict the use of such substances and adopt
substitutes that have less impact on the environment.


reducing and replacing ozone depleting substances☆
we endeavor to reduce the use of substances specified as controlled substances under the ozone layer
protection law and adopt substitutes that have less impact on the environment.
・ l arge heat exchangers (large cooling units)−having steadily replaced air conditioning units using
   specified chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs) with systems that do not use them, we completed the removal of
   such units from buildings by the end of march 2008.
• rolling stock−except for some diesel railcars, all of our cars use cfc substitutes. as of march 2012,
   we were using 0.5 tons of cfcs and 86 tons of cfc substitutes. we routinely check for gas leaks,
   and collect the refrigerants when scrapping retired railcars in accordance with applicable laws and
   regulations.
• fire-extinguishing agent−although 74 tons of halon gas was still in use as a fire-extinguishing agent as
   of march 2012, we have it under proper control and are replacing it with non-halon agents (such as
   powder agents and co2) when building new facilities or renovating existing ones.


chemical substance management☆
as jr east uses chemical substances primarily for painting and repairing our railcars, we take rigorous
steps for their use and management in order to prevent spills. we are a company that handles a certain
amount of specified chemical substances, and 13 jr east facilities submitted the data regarding the
release and transfer of these substances to relevant authorities in the fiscal year ended march 2012,
pursuant to the prtr system.*
we have also been introducing stainless steel railcars that do not require painting. at the end of march
2012, as many as 83% of the 10,754 cars operated on our conventional lines were stainless steel railcars.
beside their use for railcars, we used 44.8 tons of organic solvents for painting railway facilities and
stabilizing track beds in the fiscal year ended march 2012.
* prtr system: a system where companies notify their releases and transfers of chemical substances as required by the prtr law. it
   encourages the monitoring and control of toxic chemical substances emitted into the environment and measures to prevent negative
   impact on the environment.

environmental communication
development of environmental education by delivering lectures on request
in the fiscal year ending march 2010, to contribute to the development of a sustainable society, jr east
initiated environmental education programs for children. they will lead the next generation, and they
need to understand environmental issues and their relationships with the society.
the program aims to help children understand the environment and life through materials related to
railways. in fiscal year 2012, the program was implemented at seven schools, primarily elementary
schools, in tokyo and saitama prefecture. we will continue it.

we staged the second“seminar on environmentally friendly railways”for elementary school children at
the railway museum. together with learning about global environmental problems, they were shown the
importance of recycling by separating trash at a station and on the train.

environmental events in cooperation with other companies
to explain jr east’s environmental preservation activities and directly communicate with customers, we
joined tokyo gas co., ltd., in staging“the ninth gas and railway environmental activities exhibition for
parents and children”at the gas science center. in addition to introducing environmental aspects of gas
and railways and our energy-saving activities, the event featured hands-on opportunities to learn and have
fun at the same time.

     voice



         collaborating on environmental education with jr east employees
         i call the joint effort with jr east employees teaching collaboration, rather than lecturing on
         request. lecturing by companies usually means the content is determined in advance by them
         and employees visit schools to give lectures in their technical areas as one-day teachers. often,
         moreover, they spend an hour or so on something that might deserve six hours, including oppor-
         tunities for the students to see and try things for themselves.
          teaching collaboration with jr east employees is different in that class teachers in elementary
         schools and jr employees work together in the teaching program. all fifth graders participate for
         a total of three hours. the employee remains at the school for almost a week ‒ very unlike being
         a guest lecturer. the person is with the class as long as possible, including eating lunch with
         students in his uniform, which serves well to stimulate their interest.


                                                    there were two basic themes: the railway information
                                                    network and mechanisms of conveyance of information
                                                    in emergencies such as the great east japan earth-
                                                    quake, and the benefit to the global environment of
                                                    changing from paper railway tickets to the suica ic
                                                    card.

                                                    having been part of the program twice since 2010, i
                                                    found one problem to be that the company is apt to
                                                    focus on efficiency ‒ how can we convey more within
                                                    the allotted period? ‒ while the school is less
                                                    concerned with how much is taught than with the
                                                    children having enough time to think, absorb and be
                                                    stimulated. generally speaking, proposals by compa-
                                                    nies tend to be overloaded with content.


                                                 with jr east, however, this is no longer the case.
                                                 adjustments have been made one by one on both
         sides. the reason we chose jr east as our partner was its attitude and desire to work together
         for something better. the program provided students with a valuable learning opportunity and i
         am sure they had a good time. at the same time, jr east was able to make use at other schools
         of the know-how on teaching collaboration it acquired with us, making the program beneficial
         to them as well.

         the effort has also been valuable for teachers, not
         least as an impetus to look again at the nature of
         teaching itself. ideally, children become familiar with
         subjects, interested in them, and solve problems on
         their own. only in this way do they truly learn. thus,
         we mostly endeavored to find hands-on subjects
         that the children could experience directly. i am
         confident that we were successful ‒ that teaching
         collaboration produced the desired result.

public relations on environmental and societal activities
to present jr east’s activities for the environment and society in an accurate, easy-to-understand manner,
we began publishing annual environmental reports in 1996, and have titled them sustainability reports

eco-tourism
eco-tourism develops deeper understanding and affection for japan’      s natural environment and culture.
this year, to convey the appeal of the shirakami mountain area, a world heritage site, we held a lecture
in the tokyo metropolitan area which attracted more than 500 people. at our lecture in shirakami, 40
people joined the program. we continue to promote hiking from stations in each region, and in the year
ending march 2012, we held 626 hiking trips from stations with approximately 200,000 people in total
participating in the events. among these trips, we organized ecohiking courses which included visits to
facilities where energy resources were efficiently utilized and to seashores to pick up trash there. a total
of about 250 people participated.

 environmental management structure
 environmental management structure
 established in 1992 as a top management organization to promote environmental activities and chaired
 by the president and ceo of jr east, the committee on ecology promotion surveys the environmental
 impact of business activities, sets environment-related targets, implements environmental conservation
 activities and monitors progress toward target achievement, which is also examined by top management.
 in july 2010, the “environmental management promotion office” was established, overseeing
 environmental management for the entire jr east group.

 creating an environment-conscious climate
 jr east believes that it is important to promote environmental activities with clear goals established for
 the entire jr east group, and to have every employee actively involved. to build a climate in which all
 employees participate voluntarily, we are expanding the scale of our environmental activities by promoting
“jr east eco activities”at each work place, developing leaders through environmental education, and
 sharing recognition of exceptional environmental efforts through the presentation of awards.




                                                                            39

in-house environmental education
for effective environmental management, it is essential that all employees have appropriate knowledge
on environmental issues. we provide environmental education lectures to our employees in training in
order to develop environmental activities in jr east and group companies. through these lectures, we
aim to expand the scale of our environmental activities. in the fiscal year ending march 2007, to enhance
environmental activities at each group company, we began an“environmental management training”
program for people in charge of environmental matters in those companies.

thorough management of chemical substances
jr east is working to establish a system to prevent environmental accidents by more rigidly managing
chemical substances. we prepared emergency response manuals for on-site locations such as our thermal
power plants and general rolling stock centers that handle chemical and hazardous substances. we are
also preparing ourselves to properly respond to any contingencies by holding workshops and training
sessions on how to handle these substances, and ensuring that related information reaches all concerned
personnel.


compliance with environmental laws and regulations
there were no major violations of environment-related laws and regulations resulting in penalties in the
fiscal year ending march 2012.

actions by niigata branch office
the niigata branch office carried out various environmental preservation activities led by the committee
on ecology. in order to build environmental consciousness in the workplace and improve employees’
awareness and commitment to environmental activities, the“three e’     s”(ecology by everyone for the
earth) campaign was also launched.
specifically, numerical environmental targets (including reductions in power consumption, paper use
and gasoline and diesel oil use) were set for each workplace to build a climate in which all employees
participate voluntarily. such activities are evaluated and converted into points in order to encourage
workplaces and employees to commit themselves to better performance, and to recognize good
workplaces with awards.

actions by jr east group companies
east japan marketing & communications, inc., has its basic philosophy on the environment:“we
endeavor through business activities, including advertising and media management, to preserve the global
environment and prevent pollution, and to contribute to establishing richer, more sustainable lives.”
in august 2008, we obtained iso14001 certification at the head office and all branches, bolstering our
environmental management system.
as an advertising company, our environmental target is“proposing environmentally friendly plans,”to our
clients, toward which we make company-wide efforts.
in the year ending in march 2012, we made numerous proposals, especially for saving electricity and
energy and on the use of stations, helping many people increase their awareness of environment around
them.
the pictures below show some of our efforts.
bringing together the knowledge, experience and sensibilities of its employees, east japan marketing &
communications, inc., will carry out a wide range of ecological activities, for regional communities and
society as a whole.

environmental accounting and management indicators
using environmental management indicators in business activities☆
in the year ended march 2012, our environmental conservation costs amounted to approximately
57.7 billion yen in investments and 22.4 billion yen in expenses. of these investments, costs for global
environmental conservation, which accounted for a large portion, were at the same level as the previous
year because we continued acquiring new railcars.
by introducing these new cars, we estimate we will reduce co2 emissions by 235 thousand tons during
their service lives.
jr east has its own environmental management indicator to assess the relation between our business
activities and environmental impacts. these are calculated by dividing co2 emissions, which are a major
factor in our environmental impacts, by operating profits, which represent our economic value added.
a smaller value of the indicator means that we are making a smaller impact on the environment to create
the same economic value added. for the year ended march 2012 the value of the indicator was 64.2
t-co2/billion yen, compared with 94.5 t-co2/billion yen for the year ending march 1991.

    special topic 3 ecoste
    jr east employs various environmental preservation technologies and is working to
    create energy-saving stations known as ecoste.
     ecoste stations introduce various technologies for environmental preservation, including energy conservation
    and use of renewable energies. we will create ecoste in diﬀerent areas making use of regional characteristics.


    ■ yotsuya station on jr chuo line                            〜 first ecological station, yotsuya station 〜
    at the ﬁrst ecoste model, jr yotsuya station, under the four key concepts given below, various environmental
    preservation measures are being implemented and 17 eco-menus are employed.


           1. saving        led lighting is used at platforms and
            energy          concourses and led lights are used for
                            illuminated ads and itv for conductors.
                            in addition, the station endeavors to
                            save water in restrooms, increase the
                            efficiency of air-conditioning equipment,
                            and install skylights so that lighting can
                            be turned off in the daytime. as a result,
                            co2 emissions can be reduced by about
                            176 tons annually.

          2. creating       solar panels with a total capacity of 50kw
            energy          were installed on the roof of the station
                            near the akasaka exit, reducing co2
                            emissions by about 13 tons annually. atre

                            installed solar power panels on the roof of
                            atre yotsuya, next to yotsuya station.


        3. feeling the       eco-information display boards          are
           ecology          installed in the station and customers can
                            see at any time how much energy is being
                            generated and used, helping them to
                            more fully appreciate our eco-activities.
                            we are also improving the thermal
                            environment for pedestrians by paving
                            areas near station exits with water-retentive
                            material.

        4.harmonized        there is a garden on the roof top of the
         environment        station building, and there is greenery on
                            the roofs above platforms and on retaining
                            walls.

    in addition to the above, station staﬀ at yotsuya work diligently to further conserve energy, toward the total result of cutting co2 emissions by 189
    tons a year (40% reduction from fy2009). that reduction is equivalent to the co2 amount absorbed by about 13,500 japanese cedars in a year.




    ■ hiraizumi station on tohoku main line 〜 realizing zero-emissions 〜
    hiraizumi station on the jr tohoku main line is striving, through the use of solar panels and storage batteries, to
    become a zero-emissions station, which generates more electricity than it consumes on ﬁne weather days *.
    * according to the meteorological agency, a ﬁne weather day is one on which 40% of the day is sunny ‒ typically about 170 days annually in the
      vicinity of hiraizumi station.

         yotsuya station, transformed to an                         ecoste,   is a facility where you can learn
         about ecology
         the jr yotsuya station on the chuo line in tokyo has
         been reborn as an "ecoste," embracing the four
         concepts of energy conservation, energy generation,
         feeling the ecology and environmental harmonization.
         working at yotsuya station, where we have
         introduced 17 eco-menus including solar panels,
         greenery and led lighting, we can feel and enjoy the
         natural breezes and light. this is largely attributable to
         two specific eco-menus ‒ skylights and natural
         ventilation systems. blessed with greenery in an area
         near an ancient outer moat of edo castle, yotsuya
         station has become even more pleasant, comfortable             rooftop garden, symbol of ecoste
         and bright, filled with natural light and fresh air. it is
         especially satisfying to hear so many customers say so. with led lighting, energy consumption is
         reduced and platforms are as bright at night as they are in the daytime. train crews, too, often
         comment on this. train drivers in particular say they can see customers on the platform better.
         every jr station s top priority is of course customer safety. being bright and easy to see is about
         more than being ecological.
         since becoming an ecoste, we have had more visitors ‒ educational visits and school trips by
         elementary- and junior-high school students ‒ and we are working on ideas that will allow more
         students in the community to make ecoste yotsuya station a practical resource in their
         environmental education. currently, we plan to create guidebooks for our 17 eco-menus,
         primarily by our eco-promotion members.
         it will be a unique accomplishment of the station if people in
         yotsuya consider yotsuya stadion to be a symbol of environmental
         education. ekinaka (in-station business) is becoming increasingly
         popular and the utility value of stations has grown as shopping and
         entertainment spaces. yotsuya station is opening up the new
         possibility of transformation into a educational facility where you
         can learn about ecology.
         with ecoste projects to be carried out in various locations, and as
         the stationmaster of the first, i hope those involved will look at us,
         gather information, and apply it usefully elsewhere. of course the
         picture of a successful ecoste will be very different depending on
         local needs and characteristics.                                               hiroko shirayama

 pursuing“extreme safety levels”
 our concept of safety
 since the establishment of the jr east, safety has been the top management priority at jr east, and we
 have worked relentlessly to heighten our levels of safety. our earnest efforts to learn from unfortunate
 accidents in the past have enabled jr east to further the prevention of accidents in the future with our
 continued developments both in software and in hardware.


 safety initiatives in our medium term management plan
 in the jr east 2020 vision - i do mu -, we have set two goals to represent our unflagging commitment
 to“extreme safety levels”  . we will continue implementing our priority improvement plan for safety
 equipment, reinforce safety weak points, and reduce risks, and we will expand and improve education
 and training on safety and prevent accidents by correctly analyzing and understanding previous accidents
 and incidents.


 launch of our 5th 5-year safety plan, 2013 safety vision
 since our establishment, jr east has continued to create and implement medium term safety plans. with
 the installation and further development of our safety equipment, along with companywide advancements
 in safety awareness and skill, we have succeeded in reducing the frequency of railway accidents
 drastically from levels at the time of the company’s establishment.
 in the fiscal year ended march 2010, jr east formulated a new 5-year safety plan, 2013 safety vision.
 with this plan, we are undertaking a variety of measures. new to the 2013 safety vision are two
 approaches: safety related human resource development and system improvements; and, the prevention
 of accidents before they occur through risk assessment.
 in addition, as with our previous safety plan, we will continue to target zero accidents involving passenger
 injuries or fatalities, and zero accidents involving employee fatalities (including employees of group

railway safety promotion committee
jr east has established the railway safety promotion committee at its head office, chaired by the
director general from railway operations headquarters. the committee reviews the organization’        s
basic policies to respond to and prevent accidents, and promotes safety measures within the railway
business. there are also regional safety promotion committees at each branch office and the shinkansen
transport dept., chaired by the general managers of the branch offices and the department. these
committees implement specific measures in cooperation with the railway safety promotion committee,
and investigate the causes of accidents, implement concrete preventive measures, and promote activities
to enhance safety in their service areas.

creation of a culture of safety
our 5 cultures of safety
to heighten levels of railway safety, it is necessary to establish and support unwavering cultures of safety.
the cultures of safety we seek are based upon accident information from the past and we learn and act
upon it in mutual trust.


  ① a culture of proper reporting
    preventing the occurrence and recurrence of accidents through prompt and proper reporting of all
    accidents and incidents.
  ② a culture of noticing
    the prevention of accidents through an awareness of the causes of accidents and the sharing of
    information that would prevent these causes from leading to actual accidents.
  ③ a culture of direct meeting and discussion
    allowing for the open and honest exchange of opinions and discussions enables us to identify the
    causes of accidents and to take appropriate countermeasures against recurrence.
  ④ a culture of learning
    continuously learning about accidents and learning from accidents and incidents, which occur in all
                                   s own workplace.
    places of work, not just in one’
  ⑤ a culture of action
    safety can be ensured only by taking safe actions. think and act by yourself. this is at the core of
    our safety.



“sangen principle: three actualities principle”as a standard for action
accidents and incidents always occur at the genba.* this means that the sources of accident prevention
can also be found at the genba. in order to suitably understand and rectify each accident or incident,
jr east approaches safety issues with the“three actualities principle”as its standard for action: actual
locations, actual objects, and actual people.
* genba:“genba”means a field or workplace, where employees actually do their physical work in construction, production, maintenance,
  operation, etc., as distinguished from management or office work, in industrial sectors, such as construction and manufacturing.



changes with safety mission statements
jr east provides safety mission statements for the code of conduct for its safety-related employees. in
learning from past disasters including the great east japan earthquake, jr east has added a 5th safety
mission statement. based on its basic safety promotion concepts,“think and act by ourselves”and“remain
calm,”jr east added the wording“think by ourselves”for the prevention of human error in the event of
an emergency, and to encourage employees to take a deep breath before taking action.


■general principles of safety

  ① safety is the most important mission in transportation.
  ② ensuring safety is based on exact observance of rules and procedures, and is achieved through
     constant practice.
  ③ enforcement of confirmation and complete contact is most important for ensuring safety.

  ④ for ensuring safety we should cooperate together and go beyond our official responsibility.
  ⑤ when we have questions or must choose among several options, we should remain calm, think by
     ourselves, and take the safest course after thorough consideration.




                                                                 48

restructuring safety management
safety management: eliminating the causes of accidents
we believe that safety is ensured through management systems that
synergistically link the three major factors, employees, rules, and safety
equipment. jr east, together with our front-line employees, head office, and                                         employees
group and partner companies as a whole, is working to improve operational
safety through the railway safety promotion committee, head office safety
campaign, and jes-net. the railway safety promotion committee is responsible                                         management
                                                                                                           safety
for thorough cause investigation and taking prompt countermeasures at the                                equipment                rules
occurrence of an accident. in our head office safety campaign, front-line
employees and executive officers from the head office participate in direct
discussion about safety matters. jes-net functions to enhance our safety
promotion network among group and other related companies.


developing safety-related human resources
in the rapid transition as one generation retires and the next generation takes over, it is necessary for
jr east to steadily pass down its safety knowledge to subsequent generations. to this end, since it is
vital to develop employees as the core of our safety, jr east has assigned key safety leaders for its field
organizations and safety professionals for its branch offices to heighten levels of safety.

key safety leaders are mainly concerned with the following three areas:

  ①【full knowledge】: a comprehensive understanding of weak points, safety rules, facilities, work
     content, and accident information (accident case examples).
  ②【teaching】: regular training for employees on information they should know and weakness to be
     conquered.
  ③【foster successors】: development of successors to maturity.


safety professionals are mainly concerned with the following three areas:

  ①a  n understanding of safety rules, mechanisms of safety protection, past accident history and the
    comprehensive utilization of this knowledge in instruction.
  ② l eadership and guidance in the formulation of safety measures and accident countermeasures,
    advice for emergency situations, and the challenge safety campaign.
     
  ③ safety-related knowledge, technology, and sensitivity.

chroniclers of safety (narrators of oral history)
in fy2010, we organized a group of ex-employees of jr who possessed an abundance of knowledge and
applied skills in railway safety to act as our“chroniclers of safety (narrators of oral history).”currently,
chronicler of safety seminars are being conducted by a group of eight of these chroniclers at head office
and branch offices, in the hope that they will pass their accumulated experiences and skills down to
future generations.

the challenge safety campaign
in 1988, we started the challenge safety campaign with the aim of encouraging our employees to actively
take on the challenge of further improving safety levels, rather than just passively maintaining safety. the
challenge safety campaign aims to increase our employee awareness and sense of safety. we intend to
guide all employees to more safety-oriented behavior by having them think about and discuss safety, act
upon it, and feel a sense of achievement through doing so.


railway safety symposium
under the theme,“prepare for disaster in times of peace: how to acquire abilities to think and act by
ourselves to respond flexibly in the event of an emergency”jr east held its 20th symposium. with
approximately 500 persons in attendance, the symposium called for the importance of employees to
acknowledge areas of possible risk at their individual work places in the event of a disaster and major
accident, to individually contemplate what should be done in the immediate aftermath of such an
occurrence, to hold discussions and to repeat drills at each of their workplaces.

safety education and training
to improve the skills of train crews, accident prevention simulator training is conducted regularly in
the general training centers in each of our branches. at the jr east general education center in
shirakawa city, fukushima prefecture, we train both drivers and conductors, and provide human resource
development in the form of knowledge and technical proficiency. the accident history exhibition hall was
established in the center to emphasize the importance of learning from past accidents.

head office safety campaign
jr east operates a head office safety campaign once a year. the campaign provides president and
executive officers from the head office with a chance to visit field offices and hold direct discussions with
front-line employees, including those at partner and cooperating companies. in march 2012, executive
officers from the head office inspected nighttime maintenance work as observers, and participated in
impassioned discussions with front-line employees on the theme,“the strengthening of risk sensing
capabilities of each individual employee and the promotion of collective preventive safety measures
as a whole work force: the three actuality principles, an understanding of weaknesses in safety, and
the specific actions necessary for resolution.”through these activities, jr east was able to reconfirm
issues and areas of concern and, based on the outcomes obtained from the activities, jr east decided
to implement specific measures regarding crisis prevention capabilities in order to further heighten the
company’   s sensitivity toward safety, so that all employees will be able to think by themselves and take
flexible actions at the time of a disaster or major accident.


collaboration with group companies
the jr east safety network (jes-net) was established in the fiscal year ending march 2005 as a safety
promotion network among jr east group and partner companies that are engaged in work directly
influencing train operations.
as of april 1st, 2012, the number of companies in this network had expanded to 34. each year, through
observation and inspection, jr east holds a safety review for the exchange of opinions and a confirmation
of the safety measures at jes-net member companies. in the safety reviews, jr east recognizes the
positive measures of each of the companies, and introduces these successful measures to other
companies so that they can also benefit from the success. jr east is committed to improving the levels of
safety throughout the jr east group.

 improvement of safety equipment
 investment in safety equipment for“extreme safety levels”
 to achieve a more assured level of safety in railway operations, weak points in the current systems
 must be identified and reviewed from a safety standpoint. furthermore, safety equipment must undergo
 intensive and effective assessments in order to prevent the occurrence of accidents in the future. jr east
 analyses and evaluates all potential areas of risk and takes appropriate measures to ensure that these
 risks do not become reality, placing priority on facility investments in order to avert any major damage in
 the case of a major earthquake in the tokyo metropolitan area.
 regarding our improvements to safety equipment, and based on our four previous 5-year safety plans
 leading up to fy2009, jr east has invested more than 2.2 trillion yen for the 20 years since the company’ s
 establishment. in our 2013 safety vision, jr east’ s 5th 5-year safety plan which began in fy2010, jr east
 plans to invest approximately 750 billion yen on safety measures during the five years from april 2009 to
 march 2014, and our cumulative safety investment amounted to approximately 2.7 trillion yen by the end
 of fy2012.

installing safety equipment
to prevent collisions between trains, jr east has installed ats (automatic train stop) and atc (automatic
train control) systems on all of its railway lines.
to heighten the current safety level of train operations even further, we are installing ats-p and ats-ps
systems, which employ continuous speed monitoring functions. the number of installations is steadily
increasing; most are in the tokyo metropolitan area. by the end of march 2012, the ats-p system had
been installed on 2,353.5km of railway line. the ats-ps system is currently installed on 210.5km of line in
the sendai and niigata regions and at 47 stations. additionally, jr east replaced the ats-ps for the section
of the senseki line between aoba-dori and higashi-shiogama with its advanced train administration and
communications system (atacs), a radio-controlled train operation control system, in october of 2011.
in response to revisions to the ministry ordinance for technological standards for railways in july 2006,
we are working on measures to prevent excessive train speeds at curves, turnouts, and terminals, and on
descending grades. planned improvements at all curves that had been targeted for action were completed
by the end of march 2010.

systemization of maintenance work
when starting maintenance work on railway tracks, jr east works to ensure the safety of its trains and
maintenance workers by following procedures to set signals to stop, so that trains do not enter sections
of railway where maintenance work is being conducted. in the past, this was done mainly via telephone
from maintenance workers to stations. however, in order to prevent any occurrence of error, including
human error, jr east adopted a method for maintenance workers to operate handheld devices to change
signals to red, and the devices have since been introduced to major railway sections in the tokyo
metropolitan area. in the future, jr east aims to continue its efforts to improve the safety of its operations
through the systemization of its maintenance work in other railway sections as well.

introduction of the advanced train administration and communications system (atacs):
train control system with radio transmission
atacs is a train control system utilizing radio transmissions. by using radio communications for the
transmission of information between ground and on-board facilities, the system enables the trains to be
mainly controlled by on-board equipment, permitting reductions in traditionally required facilities such as
signals, connecting cables, and track circuits, which are currently used for the detection of trains.
eliminating these facilities is expected to reduce the number of facility failures and the number of
subsequent transport disruptions.
jr east began using the atacs system in october 2011 on the senseki line between aoba-dori and
higashi-shiogama.


introduction of effective rainfall as a new indicator
when there is heavy rainfall, we ensure train safety through operational restrictions such as limits to train
speed and, when necessary, by suspension of operations. for operational restrictions on conventional
lines, we have been using hourly rainfall*1 and continuous precipitation*2 as our indices. since june
2008, we have been using“effective rainfall”as a new indicator that is effective in prevention of landslide
disasters due to rainfall. effective rainfall is the amount of underground water remaining after changes
over time in ground penetration and outflow. using this indicator, we can more precisely predict the
occurrence of landslide disasters, improving the safety and reliability of our train operations.
*1: hourly rainfall: the total rainfall over a one-hour period
*2: continuous precipitation: the total continuous rainfall over a 12-hour period

measures to prevent railway crossing accidents
when the company was established in 1987, there were 247 accidents during the year at level crossings.
in the fiscal year ending march 2012, the number had been drastically reduced to 36. approximately 60%
of all level-crossing accidents involve automobiles. we have installed devices such as obstacle detectors,
which are capable of detecting an obstacle such as an automobile stalled on a crossing and stopping
trains, and we have increased the number of crossing warning devices in a higher position for better
visibility. more large red and white crossing gates have been installed; the barrier arms are thicker than
usual and have red and white reflective plates that cover the whole bar. these are expected to provide
better visibility day and night. studies are currently being carried out on the effectiveness of these bars. in
addition, we are presently promoting a wide range of public relations activities for the prevention of level
crossing accidents, appealing to drivers for their cooperation and understanding.
in addition, for countermeasures against secondary accidents resulting from derailments at level crossings,
derailment prevention guards have been installed at level crossings. furthermore, in order to decrease
the number of level crossings, we are cooperating with local governments, neighboring residents, and the
police to increase the number of overhead crossings.
as examples of our most recent efforts, in 2005 jr east began working to improve safety at the sojiji
temple level crossing on the tokaido line near tsurumi station, where there had been more troubles
than at other level crossings in the tokyo area, because it is on a curve with restricted visibility. the
overhead pedestrian crossing was rebuilt to be barrier-free and in fy2011 the level crossing was closed
during rush hours. closed hours were extended to between 6:00 and 21:00 in fy2012, and, as a result
of our agreements with concerned parties, from april 1, 2012, this level crossing has been closed to road
traffic at all times.
learning lessons from an accident at a level crossing on the iiyama line between morimiyanohara and
ashidaki on february 1, 2011, jr east has introduced a rule to stop trains at stations when the warning
signals at a the level crossing are being activated due to causes such as equipment failures, and when
pedestrians and automobiles are allowed to cross at the level crossing, to ensure that train operations do
not endanger pedestrians or automobiles. jr east also formulated a procedure for field staff to prevent
failures in safety confirmation.

station platform safety
in the fiscal year ending march 2012, there were 75 accidents in which customers fell from platforms
onto tracks or came into contact with trains. jr east is installing protection-related devices, including
emergency train-stop systems, on our platforms to ensure customer safety. customer awareness and
cooperation are also vital to safety on our platforms, and we are implementing our“zero platform
accident campaign”through posters, as a measure to heighten this awareness.
as a major measure to prevent accidents to customers on platforms, jr east is introducing automatic
platform gates on the yamanote line. in fy2012, jr east completed its replacement of all yamanote line
railcars by e231 series 4-door railcars. all locations at ebisu and meguro stations, where the platform
gates were initially introduced, are now equipped with these gates. and, based on experience at these
initial two stations, jr east has been working on platform gate installation at other yamanote line stations
since fy2011. in fy2013, we plan to install these gates at osaki and ikebukuro stations, and, in fy2014,
at otsuka, sugamo, komagome, shin-okubo, mejiro, takadanobaba, and
tamachi stations. with the exception of four stations, shimbashi, shibuya,
shinjuku and tokyo, which require large-scale improvement work, we plan to
complete installations at all stations on the line by fy2018.
for stations with a daily number of passengers exceeding 100,000, jr east
is currently working to install an increased number of dot-braille blocks that
indicate which direction is away from the edge of the platform.
                                                                                             automatic platform gates on the

measures against earthquakes
lessons learned from the past earthquakes
learning from earthquakes in the past, jr east has employed the following three anti-earthquake
measures:
① stopping trains immediately (emergency train stop measures)
② preventing structural damage (seismic reinforcement measures)
③ minimizing secondary accidents following derailment (preventive measures against trains deviating from
   tracks)


① early earthquake alert system
jr east has installed seismographs along coastal and shinkansen railway lines for the detection of primary
tremors (p-waves). our present system allows us to stop trains as soon as primary tremors are detected.
for conventional lines, our early earthquake alert system was introduced for the tokyo metropolitan
area in december 2007 and in all other areas in april 2009. the system enables trains in any section of
track to be stopped in the case of a major earthquake, utilizing information obtained from our shinkansen
seismographs and from any advance announcements given by the japan meteorological agency.
furthermore, early detection of earthquake occurrence by seismographs and of interruptions of electric
transmission have enabled us to more promptly detect earthquakes and start emergency braking about
one second earlier. jr east strengthened its observations for possible occurrences of earthquakes, by
additionally installing its seismometers at 30 locations for earthquakes with epicenters potentially situated
directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan area and those in inland areas of its service area.


② seismic reinforcement of elevated bridges
in response to the 1995 great hanshin-awaji earthquake, jr east has been taking a number of seismic
reinforcement measures. by the end of march 2008, we had reinforced all of our elevated shinkansen
viaduct support columns and shinkansen bridge columns. on our conventional lines, by the end of march
2009 we had reinforced all other columns in the southern kanto and sendai areas except in places that
required additional construction work. currently, we are reinforcing elevated bridge columns susceptible
to failure due to bending by strong earthquake motion, aiming to further improve our safety levels
against earthquakes. based on the effects of the great east japan earthquake, and to be prepared for
the possible occurrence of an earthquake with an epicenter directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan
area, jr east is also employing additional measures, including greater reinforcement of its embankments,
advanced plans for the seismic reinforcement of its elevated bridge columns, and the increased expansion
of its ranges for these measures.


③ prevention of secondary accidents after derailment
during the niigata chuetsu earthquake in 2004, one of our joetsu shinkansen trains was derailed while
running. fortunately, this derailment did not lead to any injury to either our passengers or our train crews.
learning from the events surrounding this earthquake, jr east has taken numerous measures aimed to
improve our shinkansen trains and tracks. for our railcars, we have installed an l-shaped car guide on
the bogies to restrict lateral movement of the car body. for ground facilities, we are improving the shape
of joint bars to lessen the impact of wheels on rail joints in the case of a derailment and implementing
countermeasures to prevent the overturning of railcars and the lateral movement of rails if metal rail
fasteners are damaged by a derailment.
nevertheless, at the time of the great east japan earthquake in march 2011, one of our trains in test
operation derailed after its regular inspection. this showed that further investigations are needed in order
to improve our safety measures.

measures taken since the accident on the uetsu line
on december 25, 2005, the limited express train inaho no.14 derailed between sagoshi and kita-
amarume stations near the no. 2 mogami-gawa bridge. we would like to report on the measures we
have taken since this accident.




increased number of anemometers (wind meters)
jr east has increased the number of anemometers at the accident site between sagoshi and kita-
amarume stations. in addition, for sections with operational restrictions due to strong winds, we
established multiple anemometers as our new standard and increased the number of anemometers in
locations where windbreak fences were installed. by reconfirming the requirements for wind restrictions
on sections of railway lines, using information from front-line employees, topography, and wind conditions
of the areas, and adding new operation restriction sections, we are working to improve our safety
observation network to counter the effects of these strong winds. we completed our planned increase
and installation of anemometers by the end of march 2010. with this reinforcement, since the accident,
jr east had installed a total of 574 anemometers for its conventional and shinkansen lines, and the total
number of anemometers installed as of march 31, 2012 was 891: 733 on conventional lines and 158 on
shinkansen lines.


                                                      as of dec. 25th,                as of mar. 31st,                increase

expanded introduction of a gale warning system
we have been adding to our gale warning system to raise the level of safety by restricting operations
not only when the actual wind speed measured by anemometers exceeds restriction thresholds, but
also when the projected maximum wind speed exceeds these limits. jr east has installed gale warning
systems in all of the 297 locations on its conventional lines with gale operational restrictions.


introduction of a method to properly assess and utilize the effect of wind force on railcars
for operational restrictions
the effect of wind force on railcars is constantly changing. for this reason, jr east has been studying
methods to properly assess the effects of wind on railcars and utilize the results to more accurately
assess operational restrictions for increased safety in train operations. together with consideration for the
opinions of experts in the field, jr east has been studying the following:
① more accurate methods of wind observation using anemometers.
② calculation methods for the yield strength of railcars against wind through considerations for track
   conditions and carbody shape.
jr east plans to introduce these new methods for the following operations: for the uetsu main line
between kobato and uzen-mizusawa from december 9, 2011, and between uzen-mizusawa and uzen-
oyama from march 22, 2012; and for the keiyo line between shin-narashino and kaihin makuhari and
from march 23, between chibaminato and soga.


utilizing meteorological information to test methods for operational restrictions
local gusts are meteorological phenomena, and are difficult to observe with conventional observation
equipment such as anemometers. through meteorological information obtained from the japan
meteorological agency radar, and by detecting the passing of cold weather fronts and the accompanying
development of cumulonimbus clouds, we have been investigating how to forecast the occurrence of
local gusts and to apply that information to our operational restrictions. from fiscal 2008, the system was
tested during the winter on the uetsu main line between niitsu and sakata and on the hakushin line
between niigata and shibata. on february 17th, 2009, we added the system to sections of the uetsu
main line, shin-etsu main line, echigo line, yahiko line, and riku-u west line for additional testing.
during this five year period of testing, though we initiated train operational restrictions for a total of eight
days, we did not observe any actual occurrence of local gusts.


research of a doppler radar observation method
we are currently investigating the possible utilization of a doppler radar observation method to help
identify local gusts, as information to be used for operational restrictions. doppler radars can determine
wind conditions by detecting the movements of raindrops and rain clouds and are used at some airports
for detecting local gusts.
since 2007, we have conducted local gust observations using a doppler radar. with the system
constructed in 2010 as a basis for a local gust detection system, we started real-time local gust detection
experiments at amarume station on the uetsu main line. while conducting ongoing validations and
improvements through experimental monitoring of the local gust detection system, we will advance our
research on the application potentiality of the system for train operation restrictions.

■service quality reforms

service quality
since its establishment, jr east has continuously striven to improve its service to the level that all
customers can enjoy travel free of care. customer requirements, however, continue to become ever more
sophisticated, so we need to respond with even better services.
with this in mind and with the objective of further enhancing our service quality, in july 2010 we clarified
our basic customer service quality policy and established the customer service quality reformation
department at head office as well as customer service quality reformation offices at various branches. we
also formulated a five year plan,“medium-term vision for service quality reforms”beginning in fy 2012.
medium-term vision for service quality reforms is supported by the following three pillars:
• quality services that reassure customers
• prompt improvements in the quality of our services that reflect customer comments, with the entire
   group working as a single team
• creation of a corporate culture that allows employees to think and act as individuals
we worked diligently to establish these three pillars during the past year, making fy2012 a key year in
our service quality reforms efforts. we will continue to make steadfast efforts to carry out our service
quality reforms and attain the highest customer satisfaction unequaled in the railway industry.



                  ■overall goals of the medium-term vision for service quality reforms

service quality coordinator
for overall improvement of railway service quality focused on team efforts for service improvement and
for providing reliable railway transport, we stationed service quality coordinators in districts and branch
offices beginning in october 2011. the coordinator’    s job is to supervise the area-wide improvement of
service quality, as well as to support and promote solution of cross-organizational problems. in this way
efforts will be made to improve service quality rapidly from the front-line field operations.


service quality meetings
to improve our service quality further with field operations, branch offices and the head office working as
a team, we instituted service quality meetings, in which senior executives from our head office visit field
operations and exchange views with field supervisors. up to now these meetings have dealt with such
themes as how to deal with transport disruptions when they occur, and how to resume service after the
occurrence of large-scale disasters in the tokyo metropolitan area. these meetings take up problems
affecting particular railway districts or areas, and the team works together to improve service quality
without being constrained by organizational considerations.

                            customer comments
                            the core of improved quality of service in jr east has been our constant attention to customer comments,
                            and we will continue to monitor customer desires and quickly introduce service quality reforms in line
                            with their expectations. to constantly improve our services it is vital for us to listen carefully to customer
                            comments — both positive and negative — and then promptly respond to their requests through service
                            improvements.
                            jr east has various methods of collecting large numbers of customer comments on a daily basis, including
                            those passed directly to front-line employees, those posted on the internet, and those given over the
                            telephone. all of these comments are quickly shared and analyzed on a companywide basis, and form the
                            core of our improvements. we believe that each and every individual customer comment contributes to
                            the core of improved customer satisfaction.


                            two-way communication
                            as the times and environment change, customers’demands change constantly. to address such changing
                            needs, we learn and understand customers’demands from their comments and respond with specific
                            improvements. this two-way communication with our customers is a key to our endeavor to upgrade our
                            service quality.

prompt service quality improvements with customer comments at the core
customer comments are considered at various levels within the company. initially, a decision as to
whether or not some action of improvement is necessary is made at the level that initially received the
original customer comments. the action will reflect this decision. if action is difficult to take at that level,
then the comments are passed on to higher levels, where potential improvements can be discussed.
improvements in the quality of service can be achieved by implementing suitable methods of responding
to customers’needs.
at the very top level, we have also established the customer comments committee, chaired by the
president, which considers the possible implementation of improvement measures based on collected
customer comments. through this system, we are constantly striving for the attainment of improved
customer services.

   what is the customer comments committee?

    chaired by the president, the committee discusses the necessity of improvements requested by
    customers and specific solution measures that will ultimately lead to speedy improvements.



sq network
based on one of the three pillars of the medium-term vision for service quality reforms,“prompt
improvements in the quality of our services that reflect customer comments, with the entire group
working as a single team,”our company and group companies closely involved in transport service
together established the“sq (service quality) network in october, 2011. the sq network holds
meetings of representatives of jr east and group companies at stations, branch offices and the head
office, to share customers’comments and devise solutions and improvements, through teamwork that
goes beyond individual departments or group companies. in this way the jr east group as a whole can
dedicate itself to enhancing customers’satisfaction.


customer satisfaction surveys
we conduct customer satisfaction surveys via our jr east customer questionnaires to enable us to gain
an understanding of how customers evaluate our services that we cannot get simply through customer
feedback and to quantitatively check levels of customer satisfaction. the survey results are used to decide
which issues jr east should most urgently address as well as to confirm the efficacy of previous measures.


wayside monitors
we instituted a wayside monitors system beginning in fy2012 to gain a more specific understanding
of the needs of our customers and of the way they use our services on each of our railway lines. this
is in addition to customers’comments we receive daily and our jr east customer questionnaires. we
have recruited the monitors from among our customers who live along our railway lines, and sought their
views through questionnaires on the internet and interviews to understand their needs from different
perspectives, so that we can increase the attractiveness of living alongside or near our railway lines.

■quality services that reassure customers

creation of a safe environment
the provision of safe and reliable transport is the basis of service quality. to achieve this, jr east works
constantly to increase service reliability and creating an environment in which passengers can travel free
of worry.


improvement in transport quality
jr east constantly works to prevent transport disruption, to improve our post-disruption response abilities,
and to provide passengers with better information.


transport disruptions
transport disruptions are defined as suspension of operations or delays of 30 minutes or more due to
railcar or facility problems or natural disasters. in the fiscal year ending march 2012, both internal and
external causes increased and there were 1,446 cases (a year-on-year increase of 91).

prevention of transport disruptions
to increase service reliability, we are implementing hardware measures designed to prevent transport
disruptions, including railcars with dual systems*, track switches of next-generation design, equipment to
reduce lightning strike damage to electric facilities, and windbreak fences.
* railcars with dual systems: railcars with increased reliability through duplication of major equipment.

early resumption of operations after transport disruptions and prevention of disruption on
connecting lines
to ensure early resumption of operations after a transport disruption, we maintain our preparedness
for quick responses at all times. we regularly train our employees on how to deal with personal injury
accidents and how to rescue our customers. we review transport disruptions that have occurred and
work to prevent their recurrence. we also develop and maintain support tools, including the introduction
of a“live field video distribution system.” to prevent transport disruption impacts on other sections, we
are adding facilities for turning trains back so that normal schedules can be maintained where there is no
direct effect from the cause of the disruption.

turnback operation
when a transport disruption has occurred, we try to turn trains back before they enter the disrupted
section, so that the impact of the disruption will not extend to other sections.
in fy2012 we installed turnback facilities at yoshikawa minami station, a new station on the musashino
line, and made corresponding changes to our atos system. it is now possible to run turnback operations
on the musashino line quickly and flexibly. we will continue to work on reducing the impact of transport
disruptions by readying necessary equipment and reviewing rules to enable turnbacks at the new station,
resolving any remaining issues in turnback operations.

introduction of“live field video distribution system”
when a transport disruption has occurred, the field and the task force used to share information by
verbal communication by telephone and photographing with cell phones. for faster and more secure
communication between the two parties, we have introduced the“live field video distribution system”
connecting district supervision centers, facilities offices, and rolling stock technology center.

learn lessons from transport disruptions and use the lessons at the worksite level
we accumulate our lessons from past transport disruptions to help us better deal with such problems
and restore regular service quickly.
when a disruption has occurred, each work site involved reflects on how it was dealt with, learns the
lessons from this, and uses the knowledge to study and implement measures to prevent recurrences.
these measures at different work sites are widely disseminated to other work sites so that each individual
employee may build up his or her knowledge.


information enhancement
we are developing methods so that if there is a transport disruption, we can provide our customers with
prompt and accurate information at frequent intervals, while we work to restore normal service. when
train operation is suspended due to an accident resulting in casualty, we are making efforts to announce
the expected time of resumption of train service within 10 minutes of the occurrence of the accident.
in the meantime, we will continue to install emergency information displays (as of the end of fy2012,
such displays were installed in 118 stations) as tools for providing our customers with transport information.
in addition, we provide information through varied media, such as through onboard led and liquid crystal
displays, the jr east home page on the internet, and cell phone service.

problem prevention measures taken by the facilities section
we are working to lessen the impact of transport disruptions with priorities on a reduction in the actual
number of incidents, rapid restoration of services when incidents do occur, and the provision of accurate
customer information. in the facilities section in particular, in order to reduce the severity of problems
and failures, we are strengthening or duplicating facilities to make them less likely to cause problems,
established a restoration base, and increased our supply of replacement parts for essential equipment.
these initiatives have resulted in a downward trend of transport disruptions in the tokyo metropolitan
area.
in our efforts to provide accurate customer information, we are working to enhance and improve our
information displays. we will continue to strive for a reduction in transport disruptions by analyzing past
occurrences and by facility strengthening measures, including both software and hardware.

transport services improvements
we are continuously striving to enhance the convenience of both shinkansen and conventional lines and
to reduce rush-hour congestion through introduction of wider-bodied cars. in march 2012, the new e-5
series railcars were added to the tohoku shinkansen and new e-657 cars were added to the joban line.
in the tokyo metropolitan area, customers’convenience in the tokyo mega loop* was enhanced by the
opening of a new station, yoshikawa minami station, on the musashino line and reducing congestion on
the yokohama line and nambu line with increased runs during the evening.
in the fiscal year ended march 2012 the average level of in-train congestion during morning commuting
hours was 178%, 60 percentage points below the rate in the fiscal year ended march 1988. we will
continue our efforts for reliable transport by reducing transport disruptions and by other means, to meet
customer needs.

   lines of other railway companies.



personal greetings campaign
we are carrying out a campaign in which our employees personally greet those customers with
disabilities, elderly customers, and others who require particular attention, to make sure that they can
use our stations and other facilities safely and with a sense of security. the purpose of this campaign is to
inspire society as a whole to watch out for and support such people with special needs. our employees
are instructed to greet and support, to the extent possible, when they spot customers who may need
special care. this campaign is being expanded to include employees of other jr east group companies
as well as our own employees.


service managers
jr east is increasing the number of service managers who make rounds of stations and are in position to
assist elderly customers and those not used to traveling. these service managers provide relevant and
timely information and guidance and other fine-tuned services in times of emergency as well as during
regular operations. as of april 1, 2012, service managers are located at 50 stations.


barrier-free stations
jr east has been working with local governments and other entities to install elevators at stations in
accordance with the barrier-free transportation law. as of the end of march 2012, we had completed
installations in 489 stations.

 barrier-free railcars
 to improve accessibility for persons with vision impairments, in the fiscal year ended march 2006 we
 installed braille maps and stickers indicating the passenger’ s current location and the locations of various
 facilities on all shinkansen trains. on conventional lines we also are placing braille stickers identifying car
 numbers and door locations.
 in december 2006, the new universal design e233 series railcars started being introduced sequentially to
 the chuo rapid, keihin tohoku, keiyo, and tokaido lines.
 spacious toilets capable of accommodating advanced electric wheelchairs with handles were introduced
 on new narita express e259 series cars in october 2009; on the new high-speed shinkansen e5 series
“hayabusa”in march, 2011; and on the new limited-express e657 series trains, on the joban line in
 march 2012.


 increased escalator safety
 to prevent injuries to customers when they use escalators, we are carrying out safety enhancements
 including measures that will prevent sandals from getting caught, prevent falls during emergency stops,
 and prevent steps from descending when escalators stop.
 jr east, together with other railway companies, is carrying out a campaign with posters and stickers to
 alert customers to the safe use of escalators.


 baby stroller safety measures
 in order to guarantee the safety of passengers with baby strollers, we have been working to improve
 the detection ability of railcar doors if baby stroller frames get caught. we are also carrying out a joint
 campaign with other railway companies, baby stroller manufacturers, local governments, and nonprofit
 organizations (npos), under the slogan“let’   s protect babies,”that urges passengers with baby strollers to
 be extra careful, as well as asking other passengers to pay attention to potential accidents.

placement of automated external defibrillators (aeds)
aeds are medical electroshock devices for the treatment of ventricular fibrillation caused by cardiac
arrest. the devices have been widely used in the united states and europe since around 2000. jr east
has been placing aeds near ticket gates at stations that have many customers, and, as of the end of may
2012, 325 stations have been equipped with one or more aeds (477 aeds in total). in addition, we
started placing aeds on shinkansen trains in february, 2009; on new narita express trains in october,
2009; on nikko kinugawa trains in june, 2011; and on new limited express trains of series e657, on the
joban line in march 2012, resulting in a total installation of 172 units as of the end of march 31, 2012.


total smoking ban in tokyo metropolitan area stations and trains
for several years in line with customer requests and an increasing general public aversion to smoking,
jr east has worked to eliminate passive smoke. in april and october 2009 we removed all smoking
areas from platforms at major tokyo metropolitan area stations, and went one step further by initiating a
limited smoke-free station interior policy, which was widened in june 1, 2011, again in line with customer
requests. all smoking was banned on jr east’     s shinkansen and limited express trains from march 2007
and on some trains providing through services with other companies from june 2009. also, with the
revision of the timetable effective march 2012,smoking was banned in the dining cars on cassiopeia and
hokutosei limited express trains, which are through services that operate on jr east and jr hokkaido.

improvements in station toilets
in order to dispel the image of station toilets as dark, dirty, and malodorous and to enable customers to
be able to use them comfortably, since its establishment jr east has been steadily upgrading its toilet
facilities. measures taken include a change to western-style toilets, improved ventilation and the use of
larger floor tiles.
the upgrading also includes water-saving type toilets and automatic faucets in the washbasins, to reduce
water consumption.
during this fiscal year ending march 2013, we will renovate the toilets in approximately 10 more stations
and thereby increase customer comfort and satisfaction.

installation and usage of wimax base stations
since february 2009, uq communications inc. has been offering an internet connection service using
uq wimax. in conjunction with this service, we have been setting up wimax base stations that enable
internet connection in station concourses where connection had previously been difficult or impossible.
as of march 31, 2012, easy connections are now available at 153 stations.
furthermore, taking full advantage of the system’s broadband capabilities, wimax is now being used to
provide transport disruption information to some station displays.


more comfortable on-board air conditioning
jr east is working on improvements to railcar air conditioning (cooling and heating) to make railway
travel more comfortable. on new railcars (e231, e233, and e5 series) fully-automatic air-conditioners are
installed. on other cars, continuous efforts are being made to provide the most comfortable environments
possible by having conductors carry out frequent temperature checks, thermostat changes and other
adjustments, and by other actions appropriate for the different conditions on individual railway lines.


women-only cars
in order to enhance the safety of female passengers we introduced women-only cars on the saikyo line
during late night operations (july 2001), and then extended the operations of them to morning rush hours
(april 2005). currently women-only cars are also operating during morning rush hours on the chuo rapid
line (september 2005), the joban local line (may 2006), the sobu local line (november 2006), and the
keihin tohoku and negishi lines (april 2010).

measures against female molestation
in addition to adding women-only cars during certain hours, and with the aim of enabling female
passengers to travel stress-free, we have been installing sos buttons on major tokyo metropolitan area
lines that women can use to alert train crews if they are improperly touched or otherwise molested.
furthermore, in cooperation with police and other railway operators we are actively conducting a
campaign to eliminate on-train molestation and have significantly increased security surveillance on trains
and in stations. as a further step in the discouragement of female molestation, we have installed on-board
security cameras in the leading cars on all saikyo line trains.



improvement of onboard service in the new limited express trains, e657 series,
on the joban line and crime prevention measures
as part of improvement of onboard service, we are providing up-to-date information via wimax. inside
the new e657 series limited express trains that started commercial operation in march 2012, we have
installed 2-tier led displays in full color showing newscasts through wimax as well as destinations and
other transport information. customers can also avail themselves of internet connections on these trains
through wimax and wifi.
in addition, as part of our crime prevention measures, we have installed surveillance cameras in car no.
1 of each of the trains on the saikyo line, where molestation has been a particular problem. onboard
surveillance cameras are also installed in series e259 and e657 limited express trains on the conventional
lines and in shinkansen hayabusa series e5 trains.


suicide prevention measures
jr east has constantly supported npos in their efforts to prevent suicides and has, for example, installed
blue lights (believed to discourage suicide attempts) at the edges of platforms. in march 2012, in
conjunction with the government’  s“suicide prevention enhancement month”we carried out a campaign
named "jr east ♥ life assisting month" to aim at reducing the number of suicides by strengthening
our efforts to provide life support. these measures included the provision of information regarding
consultation services through posters and other media, the operation of support life trains, and the
introduction of telephone counseling in collaboration with the federation of inochi no denwa inc.
we have conducted a“personal greeting”campaign, in which former jr east employees and consultants
of the japanese mental health services, a non-profit organization, jointly patrol the stations and talked to
customers.

    special topic 4 tenth anniversary of the suica card and its future
    the suica ic card, which was introduced in 2001, celebrated its 10th anniversary on november 18,
    2011. the total number of suica cards issued now exceeds 40 million, and its popularity has increased
    widely throughout the country, thanks to its use as electronic money and to its interchangeability with
    other ic cards to pay for travel by public transport.

    ■ suica s current status
    the suica card service was launched on november 18th, 2001 as an ic-based railway farecard, usable at
    424 stations on our lines in the tokyo metropolitan area. the scope of the service was expanded with the
    aim of catering for customers needs by enlarging the area of service, increasing the card s interchangeabil-
    ity and extending its use as e-money. mobile suica was also introduced for use with mobile telephones,
    along with the view suica card, which can also function as a credit card. suica business is thus developing
    as a third pillar of our business operation, joining our railway and life-style businesses.

    ■ suica in the future
    in order to develop suica's potential as the third pillar of our business operation, jr east will strive to
    expand still further the areas in which suica services are available, to enlarge its range and to promote and
    develop the use of suica e-money. more speciﬁcally, ten ic cards used in public transport throughout the
    country will be made interchangeable during the spring of 2013, which will add to the convenience of
    suica use. (this will make suica interchangeable with manaca (nagoya railroad and nagoya city transport
    bureau) and pitapa (surutto kansai council)). suica will also become usable in the service area of ryuto
    (niigata kotsu co., ltd.) during the spring of 2013, and in the service area of sapica (sapporo city
    transportation bureau) by the end of ﬁscal 2014.
    the convenience of suica e-money will be increased by adding locations and areas where suica can be
    used for payments. we are also committed to meeting new challenges by making suica information
    available as marketing data.

relationship with society

■with communities
jr east is continuing its commitment to regional communities through its “station renaissance” program,
which revitalizes stations that serve as the cores of their communities and thereby contribute to the
increased attraction of entire areas. one such initiative was the transformation of tachikawa station into
a more user-friendly environment by increasing its barrier-free facilities, creating the ecute tachikawa
commercial space, and opening hotel mets tachikawa.
on the yaesu side of tokyo station, grantokyo north tower, south tower and granroof are currently
under construction. north tower phase ii was competed in august 2012 and granroof will be finished
during the autumn of 2013. the work to restore the station building to its original form on the marunouchi
side of the station was completed in october 2012. an in-station commercial zone, gransta, is also being
developed. together, these developments are called tokyo station city and form part of the concept of
developing tokyo station into a complete city. our goal is to create a station that will serve as a center
to disseminate information on new cultures, while also serving as a spectacular gateway to metropolitan
tokyo.
we are also co-operating with local governments in the creation of new stations, in line with their city
planning, and are continuing with the improvement of existing station buildings in order to create free
passages, based on requests from local authorities. in the fiscal year ended march 2012, together with the
new construction of yoshikawa-minami station on the musashino line, and the establishment of a tourist
information office (local government facility) in hitachi-ota station on the suigun line, station buildings
were renewed in co-ordination with development projects in surrounding area. since our establishment
in 1987 we have introduced local government facilities into a total of 83 stations (as of march 31, 2012).
the free passage was constructed in yokote station on the ou line.

contribution of railway overpasses to unifying towns and eliminating traffic congestion
jr east continues to cooperate with local government-planned and -implemented schemes for railway
overpasses. these projects aim to both unify towns that are split by railway tracks and eliminate traffic
congestion, which improves the safety levels of both road and rail transportation.
with the combined objectives of reducing traffic congestion in the areas around inagi-naganuma station
on the nambu line and niigata station on the shin-etsu line, unifying towns, and eliminating congestion
by reducing the number of level crossings, we are promoting railway overpass construction projects in
cooperation with local governments.

upgrading the entire transport system by improving and developing transfer node
functions at stations
large numbers of people pass through stations where different transport services meet. to reduce urban
area congestion and to make travel more convenient, we have been increasing the number of through
services and improving our connections with other means of transport, in cooperation with national
and local governments. we are also improving transfer nodes to other transport, such as bus terminals
and taxi ranks, in ways such as constructing a terminal above the railway tracks at shinjuku station, in
collaboration with the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism, which contributes to the
convenience of the entire multi-mode transportation system.

■rediscover local areas project

development of the rediscover local areas project
under the "create together" strategy, which specifies the division of roles between jr east and regional
communities, we are promoting the rediscover local areas project. the aim is to create new markets that
also take into account overseas visitors to japan and thereby bring about increased flows of both visitors
and goods among the tokyo metropolitan area and other regions.
the jr east group has railway networks that link japan's various regions, stations that serve as centers
of local communities, business know-how, sales channels and advertising power that all radiate out from
the tokyo metropolitan area, along with human resources that continuously make social contributions as
members of local communities. the rediscover local areas project utilizes jr's unique abilities to make
full use of traditional cultures, festivals, techniques, local produce, and other tangible and intangible tourist
resources, expand sales channels, and promote the interactive exchange of information among the tokyo
metropolitan area and regional communities.
during the fiscal year ended march 2010, jr east carried out development and renewal of its long-
stay hotels and stations in the iwate, tateyama, and echigo-yuzawa areas utilizing features unique to
each area. we have thus pursued regional revitalization through our policy of cooperation with local
residents. in the fiscal year ended march 2011, after the extension of the tohoku shinkansen to aomori,
in collaboration with urban planning organizations in the city of aomori, we opened a-factory, a complex
that consists of a craft center and market in the heart of the aomori waterfront district. in the craft center
apples grown in aomori prefecture, japan's largest producer, are processed into cider while in the market,
agricultural and other local products are sold. we are also proposing to increase the tourist appeal of
aomori in a tie-up with the tabi-ichi travel package through which local residents both propose and guide
tours of as yet little-known tourism resources.
to stimulate increased interest throughout the tokyo metropolitan area, in collaboration with our
destination and other marketing campaigns, we are hosting a number of farm fresh markets at central
locations such as ueno station. all of these efforts are aimed to increase tourism through wider publicity
of the attractions of japan's various regions. with these farm fresh markets, we at jr east are working to
provide information in cooperation with local communities. in january 2012, "nomono", a shop selling
typical regional produce (mainly food) was opened at ueno station in co-operation with local producers
and local governments. nomono sells attractive local products, including vegetables, fruit, confectionery
and sake, all of which typify local produce, seasonality and traditions, by focusing on different regions
for certain periods of time. we are promoting the flow and movement of people and goods by further
increasing sales outlets in the tokyo metropolitan area, with the aim of revitalizing the production of local
foods.

■childcare support services happy child project
jr east group is striving to develop communities along its railway lines in which people can live in comfort
and can benefit from adequate childcare support, as envisaged by the happy child project. more
specifically, these communities will benefit from elements of social infrastructure such as nursery schools
near stations for supporting childcare and community cafés for parents and children. it is hoped that these
may contribute to the development of local communities and be used as venues for various events that
both parents and children can enjoy.
we will respond actively to various needs associated with childcare, contribute to the local community
and upgrade the value of areas adjacent to the railway lines.


childcare support facilities - support for working parents
jr east has opened childcare support facilities such as "nursery schools near stations" located mainly
in the easily accessible area within some 5 minutes walk from station to support coexistence of work
and the childcare. with the total of 59 childcare support facilities which have opened since 1996 (as of
april 2012), jr east is striving to further increase the number of the facilities. these nursery schools near
stations have such advantage that parents can drop and pick up their children on the way to and from
work. as evidenced by the scene that children come to the nursery with fathers, our childcare support
encourages fathers' participation in childcare as well.

parent-child community cafés - facility to encourage parents to go out
jr east is working to open parent-child community cafés that provide space where families can enjoy
spending time together. the parent-child community cafés incorporate functions and services to help
meet this goal, and are not only for families with children, but also for all members of the community and
all generations.
the parent-child community café operated by jr east, is called "kizuna937" and is located on the second
floor of e'site kagohara, in front of kagohara station on the takasaki line.

■culture
east japan railway culture foundation
in order to continuously utilize its management resources for social contributions, in 1992 jr east
established the east japan railway culture foundation, an organization that has successfully promoted
local culture, studied and researched railways, and taken part in international cultural exchanges through
our railway business.
the foundation's major activities include operating the railway museum, tokyo station gallery (which
re-opened in october, 2012 upon the completion of the preservation and restoration project of the
marunouchi station building of tokyo station) and the old shimbashi station building, sponsoring local
cultural activities and accepting trainees from railway operators in asian countries.
the foundation provides information on its website (http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/english/index.html). it became
a public interest incorporated foundation in april 2010.


railway museum
in 2007, the railway museum was opened in saitama city, and it is based on three major concepts. it
was designed to be a museum that systematically conducts surveys and research using railway-related
heritage and reference materials, a history museum that depicts the history of railways focusing on
exhibits of locomotives and cars, and an educational museum where visitors can learn about railway
principles, systems and technologies through hands-on experience. since its opening, the railway museum
has proved to be a great success, attracting 790,000 visitors in the fiscal year ended march 2012. the
museum opened the teppaku plaza in april 2011 and it continues to enhance its exhibitions and facilities.




            the railway museum opened on october 14, 2007. (railway day) (omiya ward, saitama city)

■with the next generation
        s railway association
children’
the children’  s railway association is managed by the traffic manners association, with the aim of
raising children’s awareness of proper manners on public transportation. in our service area, there are
approximately 500 active members in 12 branches. jr east has established related facilities in each of our
branch offices and actively supports the association so as to contribute to an improvement of manners
on public transportation by the next generation, and provides opportunities for such activities as clean-up
work in railway stations and field trips to railway facilities and branch offices.




■international
international cooperation
in response to requests from such agencies as the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism,
jr east has for several years been actively involved in international cooperation through the dispatch
of railway experts to asian countries in order to explain our technologies and to provide the expertise
we have nurtured over the years. we also, in response to the request from the japan international
cooperation agency (jica), now regularly offer residential courses for trainees from developing countries
during which we provide tuition in professional fields.
jr east also receives inspection visits by overseas visitors involved in railway operations. during fiscal
2011, for example, we had 518 visitors from 48 countries. these visitors have included government
officials from each country, people engaged in railway operation and researchers from universities and
research institutes. these visits help to promote mutual understanding.

global contribution through international institutions
jr east is a member of the international union of railways (uic), the international association of public
transport (uitp), the association of american railroads (aar), the american public transportation
association (apta), and other international railway organizations. in addition to collecting and providing
information through international conferences and publications organized by these institutions, we strive
to constantly work toward the resolution of railway-related issues around the world.
we are working hard to host conferences of these international organizations, during which we can show
overseas railway operators the features of japanese railway systems. in october 2011, the 88th general
meeting of the uitp urban rail transport committee was held for the first time in japan (tokyo) jointly
with tokyo metro co., ltd.
since april 2009 top jr east executives have chaired the uic and as a group we shall continue to
contribute to the development both of japanese and of global railways through our activities within such
international railway organizations.

relationship with employees

■demonstrating the power of human resources
in order to provide services that will satisfy customers, it is vitally important for us to create an
environment where jr east’     s personnel can fully exercise their abilities. our success in enabling our
people to be able to personally decide what they need to achieve and then act on their decisions will
determine the future of our entire organization.
we also have to face the fact that society is in a continual state of change, and this includes both the
awareness of working people and their working environments. as a result of this, we believe that jr east,
as a part of the nation’s infrastructure and as an organization that aims for extreme levels of safety, must
constantly respond to the motivation of all our employees as they work to meet their responsibilities, and
thereby bring about improved safety and increased customer satisfaction.
jr east continues to work to provide an environment in which all employees can enjoy their jobs while
constantly striving to attain even higher goals. to that end, we are determined to face the challenge of
creating a company where people grow through their work from the perspectives of how to respond to
the motivation of each employee to meet challenges, how to ensure a suitable work-life balance, and how
to make full use of the diversity of our human resources.
in“jr east vision 2020”    , the company advocated a strategic reform of our human resources system,
aimed at the fostering of motivated young employees, the upgrading of the skills of management-level
employees, the encouraging of veteran employees to pass on their technical knowledge and their skills to
the next generation of employees who will shoulder the burdens of the 21st century, and the utilization
and fostering of diverse human resources.


recruiting
jr east’ s main supports are the capabilities of each and every employee. our basic philosophy is to
employ people based chiefly on their personalities and abilities and then to steadily nurture them
until they reach the full flowering of their abilities. because of the large number of employees reaching
retirement age in march 2013 and the constant necessity of human resources development and the
transfer of knowledge and technologies to the next generation, we have recruited 1,810 new employees.

employing persons with disabilities
as of june 2012, 2.27% of our workforce consisted of employees with disabilities. these members of staff
work alongside other employees in a broad range of positions. we further increased our ability to employ
people with disabilities in april 2008, when we established jr east green partners co., ltd. which was
charged with the task of promoting their employment and helping us meet our social responsibility to
improve the work environment for such employees. the company was certified as a special subsidiary in
may 2009.

jr east technical academy
in order to motivate our young employees and encourage them develop into professionals capable
of playing leading roles in all fields of railway technology, in march 2009 we established the jr east
technical academy. the 4th year class that started in march 2012 consists of 48 employees from 11
technological fields who will spend the year on leave from their regular positions in order to concentrate
on technological studies at the head office. the program has been designed to enable participants to
thoroughly learn the theory and structure of their individual professional fields as well as to provide
them with a comprehensive overview of railway technologies and systems in general. through research
at universities and from practical training sessions at manufacturers, furthermore, we hope to enable all
participants to acquire a broad range of knowledge.


skills development
the development of human resources and the steady but continuous introduction of new technologies
and skills are vital to the sustainable growth of the jr east group. based on a perspective of nurturing
quality through work, we are striving to enhance the organizational power of the group and to develop
human resources capable of shouldering the burdens of the future.
with this in mind we constantly conduct training programs at our general education center and in branch
offices, and many kinds of seminars at our head office. and as part of our support for all employees
to set their own challenges in regard to self-education and to thereby heighten their abilities, we offer
both internal and external correspondence courses. the internal courses are aimed at the acquisition
of knowledge and skills directly connected to our employees’duties, while the external courses target
the acquisition of knowledge indispensable for businesspeople in terms of management know-how,
qualifications acquirement, languages, and office automation.


my project
in order to encourage our employees to face the challenges of taking the next steps in their careers, in
january 2011 we upgraded our small groups and proposal activities and initiated the my project program.
this program is comprised of three aspects: self-starting, freedom of method and importance of process,
with the fruit being the employee’s personal growth. the project is based on the belief that the tackling
of improvements in itself is an opportunity for the fostering of human resources, and, thereby, aims to
nurture employees capable of thinking and acting independently.


skills training centers-develop engineers for future railways
integral to our efforts to ensure that veteran employees pass on their technologies and skills to the
next generation of technical staff, who will carry the responsibilities for railways in the future, is our
establishment of skills training centers designed to support the continuity of railway-specific knowledge
in individual workplaces. in our rolling stock maintenance center, for example, railway car component
mockups, such as power collection equipment, door opening-closing devices, and braking equipment,
have been set up, while at our facilities maintenance center, railway facilities including tracks, turnouts,
platforms, overhead line equipment and signals have been installed, so training sessions can take place in
virtually real environments.
by the fiscal year ending 2014, we plan to establish a total of no less than 104 skills training centers,
including those that make use of existing facilities.

jr east believes that employees who derive satisfaction from doing challenging work and who can
maximize their skills are able to enhance the company's competitiveness.
as an extension to the "f program of positive actions" , launched in 2004, we have initiated a "work-life
program" whose aim is to encourage all employees, both male and female, to participate independently.
jr east will continue the promotion of diversity by encouraging and establishing work-life program among
employees.




                          we are encouraging employees to be well aware of work-life program,
                                   by using program's nickname "wara-pro" and logo.

specifically, individual organizations hold seminars and forums and operate male-female joint
participation portal (gender equality portal). they also participate in the various activities of a work-life
network, upon which the work-life program in the workplace is based, with the aims of encouraging
employees to revise their way of thinking and of creating a new corporate culture.

         i want to show my younger colleagues who want to
         become drivers how i balance work with childcare.
         i joined jr east in 2001 and became a driver in 2005 after
         working as a member of station staff and as a conductor.
         after the birth of my first and second sons in 2008 and 2010,
         i returned to work in october 2011. i had been on leave of
         absence for about three years. the mothers of some of my
         elder son s friends were surprised to know my situation,
         saying that, usually, childcare leave could be taken until the
         child was one year old.
         i had dreamed of becoming a driver ever since i joined the
         company, so for me there was no question of leaving my job
         because of the birth of my children. my family s understand-
         ing of my feelings and its support for me, together with a
         workplace environment that enabled me to work as well as
         to care for my children, were the main reasons why i was
         able to continue my career. now, i am working to a reduced
         schedule and can take my children to and from nursery
         school myself.
         while on leave, i was kept informed by telephone or e-mail
         of the situation in the workplace, and i went there from time
         to time. also, the company organized an opportunity for
         female workers on childcare leave to talk about anxiety and concerns about childcare and return
         to work and to share various information. i had two concerns associated with returning to work.
         one was whether i could find a nursery school near my home, and the other was the irregular
         work schedules for me and my husband, as he was also a driver. as members of the train crew,
                                                            we have night shifts and sometimes have to work
                                                            from 5 o clock in the morning. by comparison
                                                            with couples with fixed working hours, it is more
                                                            difficult for us to share housework and to take the
                                                            children to and from nursery. for this reason, i
                                                            was somewhat worried before i returned to work.
                                                            however, i was able to overcome these concerns
                                                            after returning to work. it was great. my husband
                                                            and i have said many times that we shall do as
                                                            much as we can, but that we shall ask our parents
                                                            to help us by taking the children to and from the
                                                            nursery should this become necessary. earlier on,
                                                            we had asked the company for advice on how to
                                                            deal with certain problems.
                                                            the number of female drivers will continue to
                                                            increase. this is why i wanted to explain to other
                                                            female workers in the company how i have been
         able to achieve a good balance between work and childcare. i hope that
         this will contribute to the creation of a workplace environment in which
         they will be able to return to work after maternity leave more easily than
         now. i shall be pleased if this explanation of how i dealt with the situation
         will encourage those who have similar concerns.
         when i come back home from work, my sons sing a song that they have
         learned while playing with their friends and they read a book to me.
         listening to them is really a relief for me when i am so tired. at first, i felt
         guilty about going to work and leaving them in a nursery. but now i feel
         really happy to see how my children are growing up while i am at work.
         when i was told by one of the nursery teachers that my son pointed to a
         picture of a train in a picture book, saying, this is mom s train! , i felt
         really happy that i was able to continue doing this job. my sons are               megumi takemoto
         proud that their mother is a train driver.... it makes me feel that my job is      chief driver
         rewarding.                                                                         miyagino transportation

■improved work environment

mental health care
in order to maintain and improve the mental health of our employees, we believe it is vitally important
for all our employees to recognize stress in their everyday lives and deal with it promptly. as a result,
we are taking various support measures, such as the distribution to all employees of a pamphlet about
selfcare with the aim of increasing their awareness of this issue. we have also set up a counseling service
in conjunction with a jr east medical facility and, through this, respond individually to our employees’
needs. in order to promote front-line care in the workplace, beginning in the fiscal year ended march
2008, we also organized training programs for on-site supervisors.


elder employee system
during the fiscal year ended march 2009, jr east introduced the elderly employee system that
encourages employees who have reached retirement age to continue working for group companies
that can benefit from their individual capabilities and skills. through this plan we hope to enable retired
employees to stabilize their lives until they reach their fully pensionable ages, as well as to encourage
them to continue to contribute to our group-wide accumulation of know-how.


human rights enlightenment
in order to educate our employees in the necessity of enhanced human rights, we have established
human rights enlightenment promotion committees at head office and in regional offices.
specifically, the activities of these committees include human right seminars for officers and employees
of jr east group and for those in charge of human rights enlightenment in organizations and group
companies. to propagate human rights awareness, they also conduct lectures on human rights
enlightenment in training sessions attended by new recruits, new train crews, work-implementation
managers, and new managers. furthermore, human rights education both for our employees and for their
families has been instigated through articles, spotlighting human rights problems that could occur in our
environment, that appear in our newsletter jr higashi.
we have also joined the industrial federation for human rights, tokyo, and are conducting human
rights enlightenment activities externally by sending lecturers to seminars on human rights enlightenment
organized by local government, along with information exchanges and mutual enlightenment discussions
with member companies of the federation.

supervise overall operations. under the board of directors is the executive committee, which includes all
directors with executive functions. usually meeting every week, this committee deliberates on matters to
be decided by the board of directors and other important management issues. in addition, meetings of
the group strategy formulation committee, which consists of managing directors and others, are held as

inquiry & audit department at the head office and inquiry & audit divisions in branch offices, and these
units work to ensure that corporate operations are executed appropriately and efficiently. the inquiry &
audit department also undertakes the auditing of group companies.
our board of corporate auditors usually meets every month and the audit by corporate auditors is
supported by approximately 10 specialized staff. they oversee executive actions carried out by directors,
with a focus on full-time directors, in accordance with the rules established by the board of corporate
auditors by investigating their attendance at the board of directors, the executive committee and other
important in-house meetings and their financial situations and other items.

compliance
basic concept of compliance
in 2005, jr east adopted our policy on legal and regulatory compliance and corporate ethics as the
group’ s corporate activity guidelines. concomitantly, we established compliance hotlines, both inside
and outside the company, for internal reporting, and have promoted efforts on compliance.
since 2009, all employees of jr east group companies have been given education to increase their
awareness of compliance.
jr east group has been making concerted efforts to further promote compliance. in 2009 we started
reviewing legal aspects throughout our business activities, and in 2011 we established a“basic matter
confirmation support sheet,”designed for the regular checking of important matters by individual
departments to ensure proper business conduct.


formulation and revision of the compliance action plan
in order to enhance the effectiveness of the 2005 policy, we developed and distributed the first version
of our compliance action plan document that summarized what we consider to be desirable levels of
conduct for all group employees.
after the shinanogawa power station incidents, we revised the plan based on full awareness of laws
and regulations, reports on the incidents and other factors, and distributed to the revised plan to all
employees. as society and the environment change, we will continue to review it and make sure all
employees remain aware and observe the plan.


strengthening mechanism for proper business conduct
we conducted full inspections of our compliance for all our operations, including group companies.
starting with the inspections, jr east group is promoting continuous reviews of all its operations based
on laws and regulations, internal rules, and social norms.
in 2011, jr east created the“basic matter confirmation support sheet”listing matters subject to regular
checking and requiring heads of departments to personally ensure that business is carried out properly.
we endeavor to achieve thorough implementation at each workplace.


education of all employees
we have been carrying out compliance education for all employees since 2009 in order to further
increase awareness, focusing on cases and topics matching the realities of each workplace. in fiscal 2013,
jr east is implementing a new educational program focused on social media and information security,
where a number of issues have been surfacing lately. we will endeavor to improve educational content
that will be based on societal and environmental changes.
jr east has also carried out surveys of all employees using“compliance questionnaires”since 2010.
results show knowledge and awareness among employees to be steadily increasing.

shinanogawa power station incident
in march 2009 jr east received an administrative sanction because the company's water intake had
exceeded the maximum allowed quantity at our hydroelectric plant, shinanogawa power station (the
collective name for the senju, ojiya and ojiya daini power plants in ojiya and tokamachi cities, niigata
prefecture). the sanction was issued in accordance with the river act and included the revocation of
a permit to draw water from the shinano river. subsequent to receipt of this sanction, we have taken
corrective actions in accordance with the directions in the sanction and have endeavored to implement
measures to prevent recurrence and to cultivate close cooperation with the local communities.
in june 2010, having obtained a permit from the director of the hokuriku regional development bureau
of the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism to again take water from the shinano river,
we resumed operation of the shinanogawa power station.
we are redoubling our efforts at compliance management to prevent occurrence of similar incidents and
we are sincerely committed to fostering harmony with the river environment and enhancing co-prosperity
with communities.


personal data protection
in 2005, we published our regulations for the management of personal information, and appointed chief
privacy officers who bear the responsibility of strictly protecting personal data. we are also working to
ensure that every employee is aware of the necessity of the strict handling and management of personal
data through pamphlets covering the subject exclusively and articles in our internal magazines. in order to
even further enhance our levels of information security we regularly conduct internal workplace audits.


risk management
the crisis management headquarters was established in 2002 to centrally collect and manage
information, and to make prompt initial responses in the event of major crises affecting the business
operations of jr east group. in 2004, we added the crisis management office, a full-time section that has
taken responsibility for headquarters’secretarial work. we are striving to be prepared for any potential
risks jr east group may face. we have recently established a system enabling us to respond to various
emergencies – terrorist threats, pandemics such as influenza, and other possibilities.


information disclosure
jr east has a wide range of relationships with many stakeholders, including the 16.5 million customers
using our railway services each day, as well as our shareholders and investors, business partners,
employees and their families, and local communities.
we actively disseminate information about group initiatives through public and investor relations activities
to these stakeholders. we also strive to disclose key corporate information on our website in a swift and
appropriate manner. furthermore, jr east is working to create wide-ranging opportunities to listen to and
learn from the views and requests of our stakeholders.

the setting of medium-term targets for total co 2 emissions from railway
business activities has been changed with the new environmental targets.
targets are now set for two indicators –“energy consumption from railway
business activities”and“co2 emissions per unit of electricity generated at
jr east’s own power plants”– rather than the previous single target of“total
co2 emissions.”in light of the review of national energy policy underway
since the earthquake in march 2011, jr east considered it better to set its
targets based on indicators that would be more under our own control.
new environmental targets are mostly short-term targets to be met by fiscal
2014, but the above two new targets are medium-term targets to be met
by fiscal 2021. in this report, values in base fiscal years, results in absolute
values in fiscal 2012, and reduction or improvement rates are given. we
believe that jr east could make the results of its activities more transparent     naomi sugo

quantitative environmental data for group companies is only shown in               azsa sustainability co., ltd.

companies’activities.

jr east group sustainability report 2012




summary from the general manager of the management planning department
a year and a half has passed since the great east japan earthquake and the
entire country is deeply involved in recovery and restoration. in the wake of
the nuclear accident at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station, there
has been much attention directed toward japan's energy policy, reflecting
various points of view.
domestically, on july 1, 2011, an order to restrict the use of electricity
under the electricity enterprises law was issued to large-scale consumers
in the service areas of the tokyo electric power co., inc. (tepco) and the
tohoku electric power co., inc. - only the second such order in 37 years.
the jr east group has implemented various saving-electricity measures. we
regretted the inconvenience to our customers as we adopted electricity-
conserving train schedules and made other changes, but we were able to
do so smoothly with their understanding and cooperation. on july 1, 2012,       makoto takahashi
the act on special measures for the promotion of new energy use, etc.,          director and general manager
by operators of electric utilities approved in august 2011, went into force,    management planning department
                                                                                corporate planning headquarters
setting a new direction for the nation's energy policy as the government
presented scenarios and options. we, as operators, will be watching the
discussions carefully and will offer responses as appropriate.
internationally, participants at cop17 (the 17th conference of the parties to
the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc))
in durban in november 2011 "agreed to agree" on a new legally binding
instrument, with implementation from 2020. at the rio+20 meeting (the
united nations conference on sustainable development) in june 2012 in
rio de janeiro, global environmental issues and sustainable development
were similarly discussed.
in these circumstances, being aware of our role in society and its
expectations of us, the jr east group has issued“management vision
v - ever onward”. we will endeavor actively, on a long-term basis, to
address global environmental issues while promoting wider use of railways,
an environmentally friendly transportation means, and contributing to
realization of a sustainable society.
only in this way, and by making environmental issues a key managerial
responsibility, will the jr east group continue to enjoy the favor of its
customers.
