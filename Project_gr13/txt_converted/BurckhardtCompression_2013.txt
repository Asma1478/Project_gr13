to our shareholders



                                   dear shareholders
                                   burckhardt compression increased its order intake and sales and achieved solid financial results
                                   in fiscal year 2012 amid a challenging business environment. our markets continued to develop
                                   positively during the past year. further progress was made at both the compressor systems (cs)
                                   and the components, services & support (css) business area.

                                   higher order intake new orders amounted to chf 427.8 mn, an increase of 5.7% (5.0% at constant
                                   exchange rates) over the previous year and a new record high for the company. both business areas
                                   contributed to this achievement. order growth was also supported by a calmer currency market.
                                   the minimum exchange rate to the euro gave us better planning certainty. the us dollar recov-
                                   ered slightly against the swiss franc, which improved our commercial competitiveness.
                                        in the compressor systems business, incoming orders rose by 5.2% to chf 272.7 mn, primar-
                                   ily thanks to orders from customers in the petrochemicals and gas transport and storage mar-
                                   kets. the css business area reported a 6.5% increase in orders received to chf 155.1 mn.

                                   higher sales and stable earnings sales amounted to chf 366.7 mn (plus 11.5%, at constant
                                   exchange rates plus 10.9%). as in the previous year, sales were higher in the second half than in
                                   the first half due to the compressor systems delivery schedules set by our customers. gross
                                   profit grew 11.2% to chf 136.0 mn. the resulting gross profit margin was at the same level as in
                                   the prior year and reached 37.1%. operating profit increased 14.5% to chf 74.2 mn and the corre-
                                   sponding operating profit margin was virtually unchanged at 20.2% (19.7% in the previous year).
                                   net income rose by 9.9% to chf 55.5 mn (previous year chf 50.5 mn) and reached an impressive
                                   15.1% of sales. net income per share amounted to chf 16.62 (previous year chf 15.22).

                                   further strengthening of balance sheet total balance sheet assets grew to chf 596.7 mn
                                   (previous year chf 530.7 mn). the equity ratio rose to 56.8% (previous year 53.3%). the net finan-
                                   cial position increased by chf 15.4 mn and stood at chf 150.8 mn as of march 31, 2013.

                                   valves department were merged into the new group subsidiary burckhardt components ag. all
                                   compressor valves and sealing elements activities are now concentrated at a separate produc-
                                   tion site within the oberwinterthur location. hans keist was appointed managing director of the
                                   new subsidiary and a member of the group’s executive board. leonhard keller, the former head
                                   of the valves department and also a member of the executive board, retired from the company.

                                   further expansion of market presence being close to where the customers are, addressing
                                   their needs competently, and offering them first-class service and maintenance are crucial fac-
                                   tors for the continued growth of our company, which is why we have systematically expanded our
                                   network of subsidiaries in recent years. during the year under review the subsidiary in south
                                   korea was enlarged and a new subsidiary with a service center was established in turkey.

                                                                  to our shareholders | annual report 2012 | burckhardt compression   5




breakthrough in maritime dual fuel engine systems we scored a major success in dual fuel
technology with the receipt of an order for a laby®-gi fuel gas compressor system for two lng
carriers. this order marks a major milestone in our efforts to position our compressors as a via-
ble solution for an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly ship propulsion system with gas-
driven diesel engines. this order can be viewed as a breakthrough in a market where significant
investments will be made in order to comply with more stringent environmental standards.

positive outlook for the fiscal year 2013 the global debt crisis – in our view – has not yet been
overcome, especially in europe, and the associated turmoil, particularly in foreign exchange mar-
kets, will also have an impact on our business. nevertheless, we look to the current fiscal year
with confidence. most of the markets continue to grow, especially the petrochemicals and gas
transport and storage markets. shale gas activities will be expanded in the usa and in other
countries, creating new opportunities for burckhardt compression in the application areas of gas
transport and storage, petrochemicals and in the new application area of upstream oil & gas.
from today’s standpoint, we expect an increase in order intake for both the compressor systems         valentin vogt
and the components, services & support business area. we assume that sales will be substan-
tially higher in fiscal year 2013 than in the year under review. the operating profit margin is
expected to be near the middle of the long-term target range of 15% to 20%.

further increase in the dividend the board of directors will propose a dividend of chf 9.00
(previous year chf 7.00) per share at the upcoming annual general meeting, which corresponds
to a payout ratio of 54% (previous year 46%) of net income per share. in view of the company’s
sound finances and ample cash holdings, the board of directors has increased the targeted pay-
out range from 40%–60% to 50%–70%.

a word of thanks we thank our shareholders for their trust. it strengthens our resolve to stead-
fastly pursue our long-term strategy. we are also very grateful to the more than 1’000 burckhardt
compression employees worldwide who once again showed unfaltering dedication and drive
throughout the fiscal year. last but not least, we thank our customers and suppliers for the long-
standing partnerships we have built on the basis of mutual trust.

yours sincerely,
                                                                                                       marcel pawlicek

higher sales and stable earnings
sales amounted to chf 366.7 mn (plus 11.5%, at constant
exchange rates plus 10.9%), the third-highest level on record in
the history of burckhardt compression. as in the previous year,
sales were higher in the second half than in the first half due to
the compressor systems delivery schedules set by our custom-
ers. gross profit grew 11.2% to chf 136.0 mn. the resulting
gross profit margin was on the same level as in the prior year
and reached 37.1%.
    administrative and selling expenses rose by chf 8.2 mn or
16.3% versus the previous year to chf 58.2 mn. this is attribut-

    operating profit increased 14.5% to chf 74.2 mn and the
corresponding operating profit margin was virtually unchanged
at 20.2% (19.7% in the previous year). net income rose by 9.9%
to chf 55.5 mn (previous year chf 50.5 mn) and reached an
impressive 15.1% of sales. net income per share amounted to
chf 16.62 (previous year chf 15.22).

research & development
further milestones reached in the development of
a stepless flow control system for reciprocating
compressors
the development project for a stepless flow control system for
reciprocating compressors passed further milestones in the
year under review. this system offers various process control
advantages and significant energy savings compared to conven-
tional control systems. field tests were broadened during the
year under review, the results of which have confirmed the
technical specification as well as expectations with regard to
function and reliability. the stepless flow control system offers
clearly superior levels of controllability and energy consump-
tion. it also received atex certification (safety in explosive
atmospheres) and was subsequently field tested in an explosive
environment. the ongoing field tests and long-term tests
across a range of different applications will lay the basis for the
planned market launch.

development of moderate-speed process gas
compressors api 618
moderate-speed process gas compressors api 618 are used in
industrial gas as well as in gas transport and storage applica-
tions instead of the traditional and low-speed api 618 compres-
sors. during the past year burckhardt compression conducted
market and technical studies to provide a basis for the ongoing
development of these moderate-speed compressors.



brand management
the worldwide implementation of the new corporate design
was concluded during the year under review. the presence and
positioning of the burckhardt compression brand in the various
markets was further expanded and strengthened. various new
communications tools were created. a new portrait brochure
profiles burckhardt compression’s unique status as a commit-
ted long-term partner.

is recycled and as little as possible is wasted. internal collec-
tion points ensure that employees sort and dispose of waste in
the correct manner. by implementing such measures, most of
our waste can be recycled. the rest is sent to the neighboring
waste incineration plant, where district heating is generated for
warm water and room heating. specialized companies are hired
to recycle certain materials (e.g. metals), in order to ensure the
materials are recycled in the appropriate and environmentally
friendliest manner. waste management practices were further
improved. the amount of non-disposable waste was reduced by
20% to 197 tonnes due to a better waste management at our
subsidiaries with local production. we aim to keep the amount
of waste at the current level despite the higher output.

cash flow

(prior year period 41.1 mn). cash flow from operating activities
amounted to chf 36.3 mn, which is chf 38.2 mn less than in
the comparable prior year period, mainly due to the high amount
of accounts receivable as per the closing date as well as a sig-
nificant increase in inventories resulting from the high work-
load. cash outflow from investing activities increased by chf
10.0 mn compared to the prior fiscal year. the construction of
a new manufacturing and administration building for prognost
systems gmbh in germany was the largest single capex item.
the sale and purchase of treasury shares generated a net cash
inflow of chf 21.6 mn.

3. financial risk management
– basic principles the goal of the group-wide risk manage-
  ment policy is to minimize the negative impact of changes in
  the financing structure and financial markets, particularly
  with regard to currency fluctuations. derivative financial
  instruments such as foreign exchange contracts may be used
  to address the respective risks. burckhardt compression pur-
  sues a conservative, risk averse financial policy. financial risk
  management is based on the principles and regulations estab-
  lished by the board of directors. these govern burckhardt
  compression’s financial policy and outline the conduct and
  powers of the group’s treasury department, which is respon-
  sible for the group-wide management of financial risks. the
  financial principles and regulations govern areas such as
  financing policy, the management of foreign currency risk, the
  use of derivative financial instruments and the investment
  policy applicable to financial resources not required for oper-
  ational purposes.

– liquidity risks each burckhardt compression group company
  is responsible for managing its liquidity so that day-to-day
  business can be handled smoothly, while the group treasury
  is responsible for maintaining the group’s overall liquidity.
  some of the group subsidiaries may secure loans from local
  creditors within the limits approved by the group manage-
  ment. the group treasury provides the local group companies
  with the necessary funds or invests their excess liquidity. the
  group treasury maintains sufficient liquidity reserves and
  open credit and guarantee lines to fulfill the financial obliga-
  tions at all times.
      burckhardt compression follows the principle of security
  before return in the investment of financial resources. the
  liquidity is invested mainly on current accounts and occasion-
  ally in the money market (time deposits with first class finan-
  cial institutions).
      the actual and future cash flows and cash reserves are
  compiled monthly in a rolling liquidity forecast. the executive
  board and the board of directors are informed about the
  liquidity situation and outlook with the regular financial
  reporting.

the expected return on plan assets is determined by consider-
ing the attainable returns available on the assets underlying
the current investment policy. the expected long-term return
for investment categories is as follows: 1.5% for bonds, 5.2% for
equities, 3.0% for properties and 3.5% for other investment cat-
egories.
    as stated in the accounting principles, ias 19 “employee ben-
efits” was amended (june 2011). these amendments eliminate
the corridor approach and calculate finance costs on a net fund-
ing basis. the amendment will become mandatory for burck-
hardt compression in its 2013 financial statements. the liability
to be considered as of april 1, 2013, would amount to chf 14.2
mn (as of april 1, 2012, chf 12.3 mn). adaption of the amended
ias 19 would decrease consolidated shareholders’ equity as per
march 31, 2013 by chf 17.3 mn (before taxes). the impact on
defined benefit costs in fiscal year 2012 would be chf –0.8 mn.

08 financial result
finance costs most of the finance costs are attributable to
the mortgage for the commercial real estate in winterthur and
the local bank funding secured by the indian subsidiary. the
decrease in finance costs in fiscal year 2012 is mainly achieved
through the reduction of local bank borrowings by the indian
subsidiary and to a smaller extent by the partial repayment of
the mortgage for the real estate in winterthur.

impairment tests for goodwill goodwill is allocated to the
identifiable cash-generating units of the burckhardt compres-
sion group (crosshead piston compressors and standard high-
pressure compressors). the recoverable amount of a cash-gen-
erating unit is determined by calculating its value in use. these
calculations are based on cash flows projections, which, in turn,
are based on the mid range plans approved by management. for
this purpose five planning years are taken into consideration,
applying the parameters listed below as well as a terminal
value with no growth at all. management estimated the planned
gross profit margin based on past developments and the expec-
tations regarding future market developments. historical data
were used to make cautious assumptions. the assumptions
listed below were used in the analysis of each cash-generating
unit. no impairment losses were recognized for fiscal years
2012 and 2011.

the test is based on the following assumptions:
– growth rate for sales                                                   6.7%                                      4.8%
– gross margin as % of sales                                             32.1%                                     20.7%
– pre-tax discount rate                                                  8.0%                                       8.0%


the discount rate for discounting projected cash flows equals
the rate which is used for similar purposes in the day-to-day
business. the discount rate applied in the previous fiscal year
for discounting projected cash flows was 8.0%.

the fair value of the derivative assets quantifies the maximum
loss that would occur if the counterparties fail to meet their
obligations. the counterparties consist solely of prime-rated
financial institutions. there is no excessive concentration of
risk.

tive financial instruments amounted to tchf 150’815; as per

28 risk management
burckhardt compression has an integrated risk management
policy. in a two steps process, the board of directors identifies
key risks in an early stage and assigns them into categories of
strategic, financial and operational risks. the risks are then
assessed and processed and consistently monitored, avoided or
reduced through adequate risk management measures. the
first step consists of a continuous risk management process
where risks are systematically identified and assessed in a peri-
odic leadership cycle at the larger locations of the burckhardt
compression group in order to define and monitor the neces-
sary measures with responsible people and deadlines for the
according implementation. the second step consists of a peri-
odic management review which takes place as part of the
spring and fall meeting of the board of directors. for this pur-
pose the ceo prepares an overview of the key risks the burck-
hardt compression group is exposed to and presents an assess-
ment of the probability of such risks to happen and the impact
they could have on the group. the same overview is presented
twice a year to the audit committee of the board of directors.

29 events after the balance sheet date
the board of directors and the executive board were not aware
of any significant events occurring after the balance sheet date
when the consolidated financial statements were approved on
