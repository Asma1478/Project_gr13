the ongoing actions to increase the foreign ownership limits on
shares of public companies are likely to become a catalyst for vietnam’s
graduation from frontier to emerging market status in the msci indices.
this is in fact one of the government’s stated objectives. previous cases
of countries ascending to the emerging stock market status have resulted
in increased inward flows of foreign indirect investments, which in turn
helped companies to raise the additional capital needed to support
higher growth.

vietnam fund universe – historical nav performance
as illustrated below, the nav performance of vnh in
the past year ranked second among 11 vietnam country
funds that have been invested in vietnamese equities
for at least five years. it is also encouraging to note that
in the last six years, vietnam holding is the only one of
its peers with its nav reaching a top-two performance in
each of the comparison periods. we believe that our track
record of consistently generating competitive returns can
be best explained by the long-term value approach of the
investment manager and its theme-based asset allocation
strategy combined with a strong focus on sustainability.

notes to the financial statements
year ended 30 june 2015



1.   the company
     vietnam holding limited (“vnh” or “the company”) is a closed-end investment holding company incorporated on 20 april 2006
     as an exempt company under the companies law in the cayman islands and commenced its operations on 15 june 2006, to
     invest principally in securities of former state-owned entities (“soes”) in vietnam, prior to, at or after the time such securities
     become listed on the vietnam stock exchange, including the initial privatisation of the soes. the company may also invest in
     the securities of private companies in vietnam, whether vietnamese or foreign owned, and the securities of foreign companies
     if a significant portion of their assets are held or operations are in vietnam.

     the investment objective of the company is to achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of
     companies that have high growth potential at an attractive valuation.

     during the extraordinary general meeting in april 2015 the shareholders voted in favour of the continuance resolution,
     authorising the company to operate in its current form through to the 2018 annual general meeting when a similar resolution
     will be put forward for shareholders’ approval.

     vietnam holding asset management limited (“vnham”) has been appointed as the company’s investment manager and
     is responsible for the day-to-day management of the company’s investment portfolio in accordance with the company’s
     investment policies, objectives and restrictions.

     standard chartered bank, singapore branch and standard chartered bank (vietnam) limited are the custodian and the sub-
     custodian respectively. standard chartered bank, singapore branch is also the administrator.

     the registered office of the company is collas crill & card ltd., fourth floor, zephyr house, 122 mary street, po box 709 gt,
     grand cayman, ky1-1107, cayman islands.

2    principal accounting policies
(a) statement of compliance
    these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrss) as
    adopted by the european union.

(b) basis of preparation
    the financial statements are presented in united states dollars (“usd”), which is the company’s functional currency. they are
    prepared on a fair value basis for financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. other assets and
    liabilities are stated at amortised cost.

     the company’s shares were issued in usd and the listings of the shares on the aim market of the london stock exchange
     and the entry standard of the frankfurt stock exchange are in usd and euro, respectively. the performance of the company is
     measured and reported to the investors in usd, although the primary activity of the company is to invest in the vietnamese
     market. the board considers the usd as the currency that most faithfully represents the economic effects of the underlying
     transactions, events and conditions. the financial statements are presented in usd, which is the company’s functional currency.

     the preparation of financial statements in accordance with ifrs requires management to make judgements, estimates and
     assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
     the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be
     reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets
     and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.

     the estimated and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
     in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future
     periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.




                                                                                                                                           29

notes to the financial statements
year ended 30 june 2015



2    principal accounting policies (continued)
     an operating segment is a component of the company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and
     incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the company’s other components. the
     company is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment in vietnam. the board, as a whole, has been determined
     as constituting the chief operating decision maker of the company. the key measure of performance used by the board to
     assess the company’s performance and to allocate resources is the total return on the company’s net asset value (“nav”)
     calculated as per the prospectus.

(c) changes in accounting policies
    except for the changes below, the company has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out in note 2 (d) to (l) to all
    periods presented in these financial statements.

     the company has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential
     amendments to other standards, with a date of initial application of 1 july 2014.

     (a) investment entities (amendments to ifrs 10, ifrs 12 and las 27) (2012)
     the fund has adopted investment entities (amendments to ifrs 10, ifrs 12 and las 27) (2012) (the amendments) with a date
     of initial application of 1 july 2014. management concluded that the fund meets the definition of an investment entity. the
     fund has no subsidiaries; therefore, the amendments did not have an impact on the fund’s financial statements.

     (b) offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities (amendments to las 32) (2014)
     the amendments clarify that an entity currently has a legally enforceable right to set off if that right is not contingent on
     a future event; and, enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy
     of the entity and all counterparties gross settlement is equivalent to net settlement if and only if the gross settlement
     mechanism has features that eliminates or results in insignificant credit and liquidity risk; and, process receivables and
     payables in a single settlement process or cycle. the adoption of the above amendment did not have an impact on the
     financial statements.

(d) foreign currency translation
    transactions in foreign currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rate ruling on the dates of the
    transactions. monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated to usd at the rates ruling on
    the year-end date. foreign currency exchange differences arising on translation and realised gains and losses on disposals
    or settlements of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the statement of comprehensive income. foreign currency
    exchange differences relating to financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are included in the realised and
    unrealised gains and losses on those investments. all other foreign currency exchange differences relating to other monetary
    items, including cash and cash equivalents, are included in net foreign exchange gains and losses in the statement of
    comprehensive income.

(e) financial instruments
    (i) classification
    the company classifies all its investments as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category. financial instruments
    are classified at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition. these include financial assets that are not held for
    trading purposes and which may be sold. these are investments in exchange-traded equity instruments and unlisted equity
    instruments.

     financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables include accrued dividends.

     cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.

     financial liabilities that are not at fair value through profit or loss include accrued expenses

                                                                                                          vietnam holding annual report 2015




2   principal accounting policies (continued)
    (ii) recognition
    financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date
    that the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. other financial assets and liabilities are
    recognised on the date they are originated.

    financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value, with transaction
    costs recognised in profit or loss. financial assets or financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss are recognised
    initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue.

    (iii) derecognition
    a financial asset is derecognised when the company no longer has control over the contractual rights that
    comprise that asset. this occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.

    financial assets that are sold are derecognised, and the corresponding receivables from the buyer for the payment are
    recognised on the trade date, being the date the company commits to sell the assets.

    a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.

    (iv) measurement
     ‘fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the
    company has access at that date. the fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.

    when available, the company measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that
    instrument. a market is regarded as ‘active’ if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and
    volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. the company measures instruments quoted in an active market at
    last traded price.

    if there is no quoted price in an active market, then the company uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant
    observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. the chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors
    that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.

    the company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as at the end of the reporting period during which
    the change has occurred.

    as at 30 june 2015, 3.1% (2014: 1.2%) of the valuations of the net assets of the company were based on quotes obtained from
    brokers.

    any increases or decreases in values are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an unrealised gain or loss.

    (v) gains and losses on subsequent measurement
    gains and losses arising from a change in the fair value of financial instruments are recognised in the statement of
    comprehensive income.

    (vi) impairment
    financial assets that are stated at cost or amortised cost are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there
    is objective evidence of impairment. if any such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of
    comprehensive income as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
    flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.




                                                                                                                                           31

year ended 30 june 2015



2    principal accounting policies (continued)
     if in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss recognised on a financial asset carried at amortised cost decreases
     and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the write-down, the impairment is reversed through the
     statement of comprehensive income.

     (vii) cash and cash equivalents
     cash comprises current deposits with banks and fixed deposits. cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that
     are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and are held for the
     purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes.

(f) offsetting
    financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position when the
    company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the transactions are intended to be settled on a
    net basis or simultaneously, e.g. through a market clearing mechanism.

(g) amounts due to/from brokers
    amounts due to/from brokers represent security purchases and sales transactions which are contracted for but not yet
    delivered at the end of the accounting period.

(h) share capital
    ordinary shares
    ordinary shares are classified as equity. incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as
    a deduction from equity, net of any tax effect.

     repurchase, disposal and reissue of share capital (treasury shares)
     when share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly
     attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. repurchased shares are classified as treasury
     shares and are presented in the reserve for own share account. when treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the
     amount received is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in
     non-distributable capital reserve.

     (i) taxation
     tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. current tax and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the
     extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

     current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or
     substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

     deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
     financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. the measurement of deferred taxes reflects the
     tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover
     or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be
     applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
     reporting date.

     deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and
     they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity.

2     principal accounting policies (continued)
      a deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it
      is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. deferred tax assets are reviewed at
      each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

      in determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the company takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions
      and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. the company believes that

      its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including
      interpretations of tax law and prior experience. this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series
      of judgements about future events. new information may become available that causes the company to change its judgement
      regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such
      a determination is made.

      at present, no income, profit, capital, or capital gain taxes are levied in the cayman islands, and accordingly, no provision for
      such taxes has been recorded by the company in the accompanying financial statements. in the event that such taxes are
      levied, the company has received an undertaking from the governor in cabinet of the cayman islands exempting it from all
      such taxes for a period of twenty years from 2 may 2006.

      the company is liable to vietnamese tax of 0.1% (2014: 0.1%) on the sales proceeds of the onshore sale of equity investments.

(j)   interest income and expense
      interest income and expense is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective rate method.

      interest income includes the amortisation of any discount or premium on zero coupon bonds, which is taken as income on the
      basis of yield to redemption, from the date of purchase.

(k) dividend income
    dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the right to receive payment is established. for quoted
    equity securities, this is usually the ex-dividend date. for unquoted equity securities, this is usually the date on which the
    shareholders approve the payment of a dividend. dividend income from equity securities designated as at fair value through
    profit or loss is recognised in profit or loss in a separate line item.

(l)   fee and commission expense
      fees and commission expenses are recognised in profit or loss as the related services are performed.

3     financial instruments and associated risks
      financial assets of the company include investments in securities, cash and cash equivalents and accrued income. financial
      liabilities comprise payables on purchase of investments and accrued expenses. accounting policies for financial assets and
      liabilities are set out in note 2.

      the company’s investment activities expose it to various types of risk that are associated with the financial
      instruments and the markets in which it invests. the most important types of financial risk to which the company is exposed
      are market risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

      asset allocation is determined by the company’s investment manager who manages the distribution of the assets to achieve
      the investment objectives. divergence from target asset allocations and the composition of the portfolio is monitored by the
      investment manager.




                                                                                                                                          33

3    financial instruments and associated risks
     market risk
     market risk is the risk that the value of a financial asset will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether or not
     those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual asset or factors affecting all assets in the market. the company is
     predominately exposed to market risk within its securities purchased in the vietnamese market.

     the overall market positions are monitored continuously by the investment manager and at least quarterly by the board.

     the company’s investments in securities are exposed to market risk and are disclosed by the following generic investment
     types:
                                                                                            2015                               2014
     		                                                                        fair value          % of net       fair value            % of net
     		                                                                           in usd             assets          in usd               assets
     shares and similar investments – listed		   116,850,605                                       93.96%      117,131,478                  97.22
     shares and similar investments – unlisted		   3,904,042                                        3.14%        1,394,749                   1.16
     		120,754,647                                                                                 97.10%     118,526,227                   98.38

     at 30 june 2015, a 5% reduction in the market value of the portfolio would have led to a reduction in nav and profit or loss of
     usd6,037,732 (2014: usd5,926,311). a 5% increase in market value would have led to an equal and opposite effect on nav and
     profit or loss.

     currency risk
     the company may invest in financial instruments and enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional
     currency. consequently, the company is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its currency relative to other currencies may
     change and have an adverse effect on the value of the company’s assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than usd.

     the company’s net assets are calculated every month based on the most up to date exchange rates while the general economic
     and foreign currency environment is continuously monitored by the investment manager and reviewed by the board at least
     once each quarter.

     the company may enter into arrangements to hedge currency risks if such arrangements become desirable and practicable in
     the future in the interest of efficient portfolio management.

     as at 30 june 2014 the company had the following foreign currency exposures:
     					                                                                                                                     fair value

     at 30 june 2015, a 5% reduction in the value of the vietnamese dong, pound sterling, swiss franc, euro versus the us dollar
     would have led to a reduction in nav and profit or loss of usd6,147,035 (2014: usd6,001,814), usd1,229 (2014: usd557),
     usd1,324 (2014: usd668) and usd723 (2014: usd50) respectively. a 5% increase in value would have led to an equal and
     opposite effect.

     interest rate risk
     interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market
     interest rates.

     the majority of the company’s financial assets are non-interest-bearing. interest-bearing financial assets and interest-bearing
     financial liabilities mature or reprice in the short-term, no longer than twelve months. as a result, the company is subject to
     limited exposure to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.

3   financial instruments and associated risks (continued)
    credit risk
    credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it
    has entered into with the company.

    at 30 june 2015, the following financial assets were exposed to credit risk (including settlement risk): cash and cash
    equivalents, accrued dividend, receivable from sale of investments and other receivables. the total amount of financial assets
    exposed to credit risk amounted to usd5,268,735 (2014: usd3,778,684).

    substantially all of the assets of the company are held by the company’s custodian, standard chartered bank, singapore
    branch. bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the company’s rights with respect to cash and securities held by
    the custodian to be delayed or limited. the company monitors its risk by monitoring the credit quality and financial positions
    of the custodian the company uses.

    liquidity risk
    the company, a closed-end investment company, invests in companies through listings on the vietnam stock exchanges. there
    is no guarantee however that the vietnam stock exchanges will provide liquidity for the company’s investments. the company
    also invests in equity securities which are not listed on stock exchanges. the company may have to resell such investments in
    privately negotiated transactions.

    the company’s overall liquidity risks are monitored on at least a quarterly basis by the board. the company is a closed-end
    investment company so shareholders cannot redeem their shares directly from the company.

4   operating segments
    information on gains and losses derived from investments are disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income.

    the company is domiciled in the cayman islands. entity wide disclosures are provided as the company is engaged in a
    single segment of business, investing in vietnam. in presenting information on the basis of geographical segments, segment
    investments and the corresponding segment net investment income arising thereon are determined based on the country of
    domicile of the respective investment entities.

    all of the company’s investments in securities at fair value are in vietnam as at 30 june 2015 and 30 june 2014. all of the
    company’s investment income can be attributed to vietnam for the years ended 30 june 2015 and 30 june 2014.

5   share capital
    ordinary shares of usd1 each
    the ordinary shares have been created pursuant to the companies law in the cayman islands. the company was incorporated
    with an authorised share capital of usd100,000,000 divided into 100,000,000 ordinary shares of usd1 each. on 23 september
    2010, during its annual general meeting, the shareholders approved that the company’s authorised share capital be increased
    by usd100,000,000, divided into 200,000,000 shares of a nominal or par value of usd1.00 each. according to the companies
    law and articles of association, the company may from time to time redeem all or any portion of the shares held by the
    shareholders upon giving notice of not less than 30 calendar days to the shareholders.

    on 6 june 2006, the board resolved that 56,250,000 ordinary shares would be allotted at a placing price of usd2 per ordinary
    share. the isin number of the ordinary shares is kyg9361x043.

                                                                                                                                       35

     as a result, as at 30 june 2015 the company has 59,416,239 (2014: 62,722,025) ordinary shares with voting rights in issue
     (excluding the reserve for own shares), and 7,819,500 (2014: 4,815,215) are held as reserve for own shares. the company strives
     to invest the capital raised to meet the company’s investment objectives which are to achieve long term capital appreciation
     through a diversified portfolio of companies that have high potential in vietnam. the company achieves this aim by investing
     principally in securities of former state-owned entities (“soes”) in vietnam prior to, at or after such securities becoming listed on
     the vietnam stock exchange.

     the company does not have any externally imposed capital requirements.

     incremental costs directly attributable to the issue or redemption of ordinary shares are recognised directly in equity as a
     deduction from the proceeds or part of the acquisition cost.

     the company’s general intention is to reinvest the capital received on the sale of investments. however, the board may from
     time to time and at its discretion, either use the proceeds of sales of investments to meet the company’s expenses or distribute
     them to shareholders. alternatively, the board of directors may redeem ordinary shares with such proceeds for shareholders pro
     rata to their shareholding upon giving notice of not less than 30 calendar days to shareholders (subject always to applicable
     law) or repurchase ordinary shares at a price not exceeding the last published net asset value per share.

     warrants
     on 19 may 2015, the company issued a prospectus for a bonus issue of warrants to shareholders pro rata, on the basis of one
     warrant for every three ordinary shares held. the exercise dates of these warrants will be on 1 june 2016, 1 december 2016
     and 1 june 2017 with the exercise price of usd1.998. a total of 19,977,746 warrants were issued and were listed on london
     alternative investment market. at the reporting date 19,977,746 warrants are outstanding.

     although there can be no certainty as to whether any or all of the warrants will be exercised, if the bonus issue proceeds and all
     of the warrants are exercised on the exercised dates at the exercise price, the maximum net proceeds that could arise on such
     exercise would be approximately usd39.92 million. the net proceeds arising on the exercise of the warrants will be invested in
     accordance with the company’s investment policy.

6    net assets attributable to shareholders
     total equity of usd124,359,535 (2014:usd120,486,693) represents net assets attributable to shareholders. there is no difference
     between net assets attributed to shareholders calculated as per the prospectus and in accordance with the company’s policy
     (2014: none).

    investment management fees
    the company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the investment manager agreement as detailed in the company’s
    circular dated 16 august 2013. pursuant to the amended agreement the investment manager is entitled to receive a monthly
    management fee, paid in the manner set out as below:

    • on the amount of the net asset value of the company up to and including usd100 million, one-twelfth of two per cent.;
    • on the amount of the net asset value of the company above usd100 million up to and including usd150 million, one-twelfth
      of 1.75 per cent.; and
    • on the amount of the net asset value of the company that exceeds usd150 million, one-twelfth of 1.50 per cent.

    the management fee accruing to the investment manager for the year to 30 june 2015 was usd2,444,321 (2014: usd2,142,403).

    incentive fees
    the company will pay the investment manager an incentive fee equal to 15 per cent of the excess performance amount each
    year, subject to certain criteria being met. excess performance amount is calculated as follows:

    excess performance amount = (adjusted nav per share – initial high water mark) x weighted average number of shares

    the initial high water mark is equal to 30 september 2013 nav per share increased by 8%. after the initial accounting period
    (i.e. 30 june 2015), the initial high water mark will be compounded by 5% annually.

    the fee is calculated and payable as set out in the investment management agreement side letter dated 11 september 2013.

12 fair value information
     for certain of the company’s financial instruments not carried at fair value, such as cash and cash equivalents, accrued
     dividends, other receivables, receivables/payable upon sales/purchase of investments and accrued expenses, the amounts
     approximate fair value due to the immediate or short term nature of these financial instruments.

     other financial instruments are measured at fair value on the statement of comprehensive income.

     fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on market conditions and information about the financial
     instrument. these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement and
     therefore, cannot be determined with precision. changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

     fair value hierarchy
     the table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. the different levels have been
     defined as follows:

     • level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. this level includes listed equity
       securities and debt instruments on exchanges (for example, london stock exchange, frankfurt stock exchange, new york
       stock exchange) and exchange traded derivatives like futures (for example, nasdaq, s&p 500).
     • level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
       (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). this level includes the majority of the otc derivative contracts, traded
       loans and issued structured debt. the sources of input parameters like libor yield curve or counterparty credit risk are
       bloomberg and reuters.
     • level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). this level
       includes equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components. this hierarchy requires the use
       of observable market data when available. the company considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations
       where possible.

12 fair value information (continued)
    the table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value at the reporting date by the level in the fair value
    hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised. the amounts are based on the values recognised in the
    statement of financial position. all fair value measurements below are recurring.

    		                                                                                                         level 1                  level 2               level 3                total

    the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined
    based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. assessing whether an input
    is significant requires judgement including consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability. moreover, if a fair value
    measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that fair value
    measurement is a level 3 measurement.

    although the company believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different assumptions could lead to
    different measurements of fair value. for fair value measurements in level 3, if the reasonable possible alternative assumptions
    were increased/decreased by 10%, the impact on profit/(loss) would be nil (2014: usd139,475).
