                                                   has translated into action, with an increase of over 1,000 volunteering
                                                   hours compared to a year ago. much of this growth can be attributed to
                                                   ‘volunteaming’, an initiative that we promoted among our people last
                                                   year that combines department teambuilding with contributing time
                                                   and effort to a worthy cause. we certainly plan to further develop this
                                                   culture of volunteerism among our people.

waste is a key issue for singapore. as a small island nation with                                        hazardous waste generation
limited land space and a growing population, we need to be very                                                   (tonnes)
mindful of the waste that we generate. since the 1970's, the amount
of solid waste disposed of in singapore has increased six-fold1.                      2,000
as one of the leading companies in singapore, we aim to lead by
example and play our part in managing waste responsibly.                              1,500
our priority is to reduce the amount of waste that we generate at the
workplace. we adopt a two-pronged approach at the company and                         1,000
individual levels. for example, we promote personal responsibility
like encouraging our people to bring their own water bottles or mugs
to meetings instead of using the biodegradable, disposable cups that                   500

a key environmental initiative introduced during the year
is project less, with the tagline “it’s time we did less –
to protect our planet”.
                        singtel project less environmental campaign

                        launched on 1 march 2010, the eight-week
                        campaign aimed to promote a culture of
                        ‘less’ – little eco steps – among our staff
                        and customers to adopt simple green acts
                        to care for our environment. we hope to
                        reduce our carbon footprint by spreading
                        the ethos that little acts can collectively
                        make a big difference.
we organised numerous activities for our people to participate
actively in this campaign, including sharing of green tips by
our people and management members, a photo contest with
‘environment in focus’ as its theme, and an eco-trip to the
newater visitor centre to understand the water challenges
we face as a nation. our annual plant-a-tree day became a
key event of the campaign.

regional disaster relief
outside of singapore and australia, we are present in six other asian
countries through our strategic stakes in our regional associates, and we
support community development in these countries. this can be seen from,
for example, our reading project with globe in the philippines which we
reported on last year. another area is that of disaster relief, where we help
the affected communities that include our regional customers and
colleagues who are based overseas.

the floods in australia
we made an appeal to our people in singapore to donate generously and help
the flood victims in queensland, victoria and north new south wales through
our employee donation portal. matching their donations dollar for dollar, we
raised over s$76,000.

the floods in pakistan
in september 2010, singtel donated $80,000 to the pakistan flood relief
through mercy relief, an independent non-governmental humanitarian
charitable organisation.
