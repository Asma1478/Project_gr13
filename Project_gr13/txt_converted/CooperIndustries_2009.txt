     principles and values




     cooper industries’ worldwide
     operations are guided by these
     principles:
                passion for the customer
                innovation is our lifeblood
                leveraging technologies
                excel at globalization
                continuous improvement in everything we do


     in recent years, the company has taken a more comprehensive, holistic approach to evaluat-
     ing its business in an effort to better serve its customers, thereby laying the foundation for a
     responsible, sustainable and profitable enterprise that embodies the following core values:


                integrity
                people and leadership
                accountability
                speed and adaptability
                execution


     this initial corporate social responsibility report is another tangible example of cooper’s
     principles and core values in action. it is the next step in the company’s journey towards
     becoming a “socially responsible, sustainable business” in the 21st century and beyond. after
     175 years in business, cooper has learned that exploring and understanding what questions to
     ask may be more telling and important than the answers proffered at any given time.

cooper envirotemp® fr3™—transforming
transformers with the “magic” of beans

historically, electrical transformers have had a dubious reputation when
it comes to their environmental impacts and performance. at one time,
they were cooled with fluids containing pcbs—polychlorinated biphe-
nyls, a highly toxic, man-made compound that was banned in the late
1970s because of its harmful health effects and its propensity to build
up in the environment. the replacement for pcbs was mineral oil, a
petroleum-based product.

      cooper’s commitment to its most valuable resource—its employees—
      is long held. with an employee population in excess of 33,000 people
      working at more than 100 manufacturing facilities and offices around
      the world, cooper has policies and practices that ensure employee
      safety, continuous education and professional advancement. multi-year
      employee education, development and training programs, with empha-
      sis in operations, finance, human resources, leadership and sales and
      marketing are available to train future company leaders. salaried
      employees, exempt and non-exempt, receive annual performance evalu-
      ations. association rights are protected and labor relations are good.8
      cooper prohibits harassment and discrimination—policies which have
      been in place globally for decades. child labor is also prohibited—no
      one under the age of 16 may be employed anywhere in the world. there
      is full compliance with all local laws and regulations concerning mini-
      mum age requirements for employment. by respecting the rights of its

employees taking charge


occupational safety and health is serious business at cooper industries.
as a central part of the effort to create a culture that is actively aware
of safety issues, cooper industries honors the accomplishments of
workers and management through the “take charge safety and health
awards.” these awards recognize creative approaches to safety
management and training and the results of those efforts—safe,
healthy and injury-free facilities.

the take charge awards program is the most visible part of a compre-
hensive system to monitor and measure safety and health matters in
the workplace. all cooper facilities utilize an internally developed set of
metrics known as oshme (occupational safety health management
evaluation). this data forms a key part of the operational metrics—key
performance indicators—that all plant managers report and discuss
on a regular basis. employees are actively involved in the process,
from daily briefings and discussions, to weekly “toolbox meetings,”
to participation in facility safety committees. employees are actively

      community

      community—cooper’s work
      extends beyond products and
      customers
      corporate giving and community outreach have been a part of cooper
      industries’ operating philosophy and business practices for decades.
      the cooper industries foundation, a non-profit section 501(c)(3) private
      foundation funded by company contributions, was founded in 1964.
      additional corporate giving is done by each of the eight business divi-
      sions, globally, as a part of the annual budget and planning process.

      to date, the community outreach and charitable giving programs that
      originate at the business division level, which comprise a significant
      portion of cooper industries’ overall corporate giving programs, have
      only been reported on a dollars expended basis. the rationale has
      been to give the local cooper business leaders broad discretion in
      determining what will best serve their particular communities. the
      company believes this approach best serves all of the interests at
      stake, allowing good societal activities to be done at the local level,
      while allowing the managers and employees to focus most of their time
      and energies on creating and delivering great products to customers,
      which, in turn, creates the profits that allow cooper’s charitable pro-
      grams to thrive.

      the variety of programs and grant requests that are funded reflects the
      diversity of the people and places where cooper operates. this section
      highlights some of these community investments.

      governance and ethics

      in 1833, charles and elias cooper founded the company that would become
      cooper industries, ltd. today, cooper is a publicly traded corporation,
      organized under the laws of bermuda. the company’s administrative
      headquarters is located in houston, texas, where all of the members of
      the company’s senior management team are resident, as are all of the
      corporate officers. the rationale for organizing the company under the
      laws of bermuda while maintaining the principal executive offices in the
      united states is to give the company an equal footing with its non-usa-
      based competitors, particularly with regard to issues of income and taxa-
      tion for its operations around the world. some may take issue with the
      company’s decision, claiming that it results in the company “not paying
      its fair share of u.s. taxes,” but this is both incorrect and overly simplistic.
      the current legal structure allows cooper to maintain its large manufac-
      turing and employment infrastructure in the united states and compete
      more effectively in global markets, while returning maximum value to its
      shareholders.
