  prioritizing communication with the
  local community
smm understands the importance of communication with the
local community and is making a concentrated effort to maintain
this as part of pogo’s social responsibility. as norifumi ushirone,
president of sumitomo metal mining pogo llc, points out, “in
mining, we can never operate in isolation from the location where
the resources are. for this reason, cooperation with the local
community is vitally important.”
   before smm became the operator of pogo mine, there was
very little contact between the local community and pogo, and
stories about pogo rarely appeared in the local media. at that
point, smm became the operator, whereupon ushirone actively

        criteria
        the company applies its own reporting criteria as described in the report. these are derived, among others, from the sustainability reporting guidelines
        version 3.0 of the gri and environmental reporting guidelines of japan’s ministry of the environment. we used these criteria to evaluate the indicators. for
        the gri application level, we used the criteria stipulated by the gri.

        procedures performed
        we conducted our engagement in accordance with ‘international standard on assurance engagements (isae) 3000, assurance engagements other than
        audits or reviews of historical financial information’ issued by the international auditing and assurance standards board, and the ‘practical guidelines of
        sustainability information assurance’ of j-sus.
             the limited assurance engagement on the report consisted of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information
        presented in the report, and applying analytical and other procedures. the level of assurance provided is thus not as high as that provided by a reasonable
        assurance engagement. our assurance procedures included:
        • interviews with the company’s responsible personnel to obtain an understanding of its policy for the preparation of the report.
        • w ith respect to the indicators,
             ➢ reviews of the company’s reporting criteria.
             ➢ inquiries about the design of the systems and methods used to collect and process the indicators.
             ➢ analytical reviews of the indicators.
             ➢ e xamining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the generation, aggregation and reporting of the indicators in conformity with the company’s
                reporting criteria, and also a recalculation of the indicators.
             ➢ v isit to hyuga smelting co., ltd. selected on the basis of a risk analysis.
             ➢ e valuating the overall statement in which the indicators are expressed.
        • evaluating the company’s self-declared gri application level against the application level criteria.
        • an assessment of the alignment of the company’s policies to the icmm’s 10 sd principles and the applicable mandatory requirements set out in icmm
           position statements through documentation reviews and interviews.
        • interviews and documentation reviews of the company’s process of identifying and prioritizing its material issues.
        • interviews and documentation reviews of the company’s approach to and management of its material issues.

        conclusion
        based on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that:
                                                                                                                                                                                  assurance
