some of our key waste disposal and recycling
initiatives include:

o plastics: in 2014, we developed partnerships to
  help us recycle plastic film, bags and wrap. as a
  result of these programs, we recycled more than 7
  million pounds of plastic film, bags and wrap from
  shipping, store operations and customers in 2016.

o dry waste: at select stores, associates place paper,
  in-store signage, cardboard and bagged trash into
  a single compactor. materials are collected and
  delivered to a facility to be sorted before being
  appropriately recycled or disposed of. our national
  waste vendors provide monthly data at the store
  level for cardboard, trash, paper and comingled
  recyclables. to continually improve waste diversion
  rates, we conduct regular waste audits at the
  stores. the audit examines the waste in both the
  cardboard and trash compactors to ensure that
  waste is correctly sorted for maximum recycling.

o beauty product recycling: kohl’s stores recycle
  fragrance testers, nail polish, soaps and other
  beauty products. products are collected and
  recycled into useful items like paints for models,
  outdoor furniture, floor cleaners, and deodorizing
  sprays.

o compactor labeling: in 2016, stores received large
  labels for waste compactors to remind associates
  of our waste policies and which acceptable
  materials to place in each compactor.
