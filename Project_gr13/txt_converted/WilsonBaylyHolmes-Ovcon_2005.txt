      chairman’s statement




      signiﬁcant growth      it gives me great pleasure to report that the group has once again achieved increased earnings per
      in all areas           share. in an industry not known for stability, wbho has consistently produced improved earnings.
                             in fact, there has not been a year since 1994 that the group has not achieved results better than the
                             previous year in real terms. growth in headline earnings per share over this period has been at a
                             compound rate of 27% per annum.


      turnover at a          it is also pleasing to report that after a number of years of low growth, turnover for the year reached a
      record level           record level of r4,75 billion in 2005. a large portion of this increase is attributable to the consolidation
                             of the results of our australian subsidiary, probuild constructions, but apart from this, our other
                             contracting operations recorded an increase in turnover of 30% for the year.


      cash balances          the increase in activity during the year was anticipated and led us to budget for a higher level of
      improve                capital expenditure. this amounted to r174 million compared to r87 million spent in the previous year.
                             despite this increase, as well as expenditure on other acquisitions and a demand for a higher level of
                             working capital, cash balances increased by r95 million during the year. the group continues to have
                             no gearing after taking cash balances into account.


      buoyant conditions     trading conditions in the building industry in south africa have shown a steady improvement throughout
      expected to continue   the year and all areas are presently working at very high levels of activity. this is borne out by the level
                             of our order book which amounted to r4,2 billion at the end of the year. the bulk of the large projects
                             recently announced have not yet commenced and there are already strains arising from shortages of
                             skilled labour and certain construction materials. this situation can only lead to higher costs as
                             companies compete for a dwindling pool of resources.


      the concor bid         it was with this situation in mind that we initiated a bid to acquire concor limited. apart from
                             providing additional resources, the merger would have expanded our activities into areas in which we
                             do not presently operate. unfortunately, we were not able to come to terms with the major shareholder
                             in concor and as a result we withdrew our offer.


      acquisitions           the group increased its stake in probuild constructions (aust) pty limited from 49% to 51% with
                             effect from 1 july 2004. the company’s main sphere of operations is in melbourne. there has been a
                             decline in construction activity in the city but despite this, probuild managed to exceed both its
                             budgeted turnover and proﬁt for the year. although this decline is expected to continue into the new
                             year we are budgeting for proﬁts of the same order as those achieved in 2005.

                             the group also acquired, with effect 1 april 2005, a 49% interest in edwin construction (pty) limited,
                             a black empowered, roads and earthworks contractor. we expect this company to operate successfully,
                             but its contribution to group proﬁts will be minor in nature.



page 4 ■ wbho annual report 2005

acquisitions (continued)   competition commission approval to acquire the 67% of the shares in capital africa steel (pty)
                           limited which we did not already own, was granted at the end of july 2005 and we will be
                           consolidating the results of this group for 11 months of the new year.


black economic             negotiations to establish a construction charter have taken place with various stakeholders throughout
empowerment (bee)          the year. i have been one of the members representing the industry in these negotiations. we believe
                           that we are close to a ﬁnal agreement and the charter could come into operation in 2006. this will
                           give clear direction on the most effective way of implementing our bee equity transfer. in the meantime
                           skills development, procurement and other elements of the scorecard continue to be addressed.


prospects                  all indications are that buoyant conditions in the industry should continue for some time. there is
                           strong growth in ﬁxed capital investment, interest and inﬂation rates are expected to remain within
                           target levels and gdp growth should increase. as previously mentioned, the constraints to growth will
                           be the lack of skilled management and labour and shortages of certain materials and equipment. it is
                           also vital that the government improves its capacity to deliver. on balance, we believe that wbho
                           should experience a further year of real growth in earnings per share in 2006.


thanks and appreciation    a fair proportion of our turnover derives from repeat work from clients for whom we have contracted
                           for many years. we are deeply grateful for this support and look forward to maintaining these
                           relationships for many years to come. i would also like to thank my fellow directors for their sound
                           advice and support. in particular i would like to thank angus mackenzie who will be retiring as a
                           director at the forthcoming agm. his successor as ﬁnancial director of the group will be john abbott,
                           who has been with the company for the last 16 years. we are conﬁdent that the transition will be
                           smooth and that john will play a valuable role in maintaining the group on its sound ﬁnancial course.
                           finally, i would like to thank all our employees for their unstinting efforts in making this another
                           successful year for wbho.

                            the group has had another successful year with headline earnings up 20,6% to 251,5 cents per share.
                            with effect from 1 july 2004 probuild constructions (aust) pty limited became a subsidiary. the
                            accounting treatment has changed and the results of probuild are now consolidated as opposed to
                            being equity accounted.

                            in order to give stakeholders a better appreciation of the performance of the group during the year we
                            have restated the comparative ﬁgures in the table below so that probuild’s results are also consolidated.

                            the increase in turnover of 30% was due to a signiﬁcant increase in activity in the building market.
                            only a moderate increase in turnover was achieved in the roads and earthworks division, but a
                            substantial increase in turnover was achieved in the civil engineering division. however, our share of
                            this market remains small. the percentage of foreign turnover, excluding australia, remained at the
                            same level as reported last year. however, the foreign operating proﬁt excluding australia increased by
                            a substantial 76%. operating margins decreased to 3,9% of turnover compared to the 4,7% last year.
                            the main reason for this is the increase of building work in the turnover mix for the year. because of
                            the high level of sub-contractor activity in these contracts, margins are lower than those prevailing in
                            other types of construction contracts.

building division
overview            the division experienced moderate growth in the central areas of south africa but achieved spectacular
                    growth in the coastal regions, particularly in the western cape. unfortunately contract proﬁts did not
                    increase in tandem and there was a consequent decrease in margins during the year.

north               major contracts which have recently been awarded include the greenstone mall for r540 million, the
                    emperor apartment block in sandton and a 90 000 m2 woolworths distribution warehouse in midrand.
                    we are also in the process of negotiating various contracts to replace four shopping centre contracts
                    due for completion towards the end of the year, namely paarl mall, garden route mall in george,
                    riverside mall in nelspruit, and waterfall mall in rustenburg. construction north participated in joint
                    ventures with the respective coastal divisions in executing certain of these contracts. some of our larger
                    contracts successfully completed in this ﬁnancial year include the r300 million clearwater mall,
                    the department of trade and industry ofﬁce blocks in pretoria and bowman gilﬁllan’s new ofﬁces
                    in sandton.

cape                it has been an exceedingly busy year for the cape with turnover well above last year’s level.
                    the highlight this year was the completion of the cape gate regional shopping centre, valued at
                    r340 million. the kuriake apartment block at the strand was successfully completed and work
                    continued on eventide apartments in clifton. the us embassy in tokai was completed in august this
                    year. we have just started the construction of a new hospital at blaauwberg and work has started on
                    knightsbridge apartments, icon apartments and pick ’n pay head ofﬁce. we have also started the
                    mandela-rhodes redevelopment in the west city precinct in joint venture with murray and roberts.
                    we are busy with three shopping malls, in somerset west, tygervalley and paarl which will be opening
                    in september and october of this year.

kwazulu-natal       this year kzn contributed satisfactory results from an increased turnover. the successful completion
                    of the r100 million mary theresa hospital in mount frere was our major achievement this year.
                    the r360 million sibaya casino and entertainment kingdom at umdloti on the north coast was also
                    completed this year, the project taking us 16 months. we are engaged on a number of large apartment
                    blocks at the simbithi eco-estate near ballito where the group has a 50% interest in the development.
                    work on the extensions to durban’s r300 million international convention centre, the icc arena,
                    commenced in april and notable progress has already been made.




                                                                                    wbho annual report 2005 ■ page 9

      eastern cape                 the eastern cape area has had a good year with building activity increasing steadily over the period.
                                   during the year the walker drive shopping centre and extensions to netcare’s greenacres clinic were
                                   successfully completed. currently we are building langeberg mall in mossel bay worth r160 million
                                   and are busy with four residential apartment blocks along the port elizabeth beachfront. work has
                                   recently started on the r50 million access park and on new facilities for maritime motors.

                                   the building industry in the eastern cape is extremely buoyant at the moment and has a positive
                                   outlook for the medium term. we have already secured in the region of 80% of our forecast turnover
                                   for the new year which itself is 2,5 times higher than 2005.

                                   non-residential building industry in melbourne. two years ago, a branch was established in sydney and
                                   a 60% stake acquired in a civil engineering contracting company, basic constructions, in brisbane.


                                   despite a downturn in the value of work on offer in melbourne, we nevertheless managed to increase
                                   turnover by 30%. however, margins were affected and although proﬁts for the year were on budget
                                   they were slightly lower than those achieved in 2004.


                                   we were busy on a number of contracts in sydney during the year, the largest being the common, a
                                   17-storey apartment block on the fringes of the sydney cbd. the company has now established a ﬁrm
                                   foothold in sydney and this should augur well for the future.


                                   construction activity in brisbane has been at a high level and this is reﬂected in basic constructions’
                                   turnover for the year which has increased by 74%. proﬁts for the year have also shown very strong
                                   growth.


                                   it should be kept in mind that the activities in sydney and brisbane are small compared to those in
                                   melbourne. despite the expected continued decline in construction activity we are nevertheless
                                   budgeting for proﬁts of a similar level as those achieved in 2005.


      civil engineering division   despite the civil market being very quiet for the period under review we performed satisfactorily with
                                   revenue and margins being well above budget. projects were undertaken for sasol, impala platinum,
                                   lonmin, xstrata alloys and anglo platinum, amongst others.

                                   it is anticipated that there will be a signiﬁcant upturn in the civil engineering market in the coming
                                   year with a number of major projects being launched in the mining, power generation and
                                   infrastructure ﬁelds.

roads and earthworks division

overview                   the roads and earthworks division traded satisfactorily with a reduction of 10% of anticipated turnover
                           and an increase in budgeted proﬁts for the year under review. the restructuring of the division into
                           regions at the beginning of the year has proved successful.

                           prospects for the division for the next ﬁnancial year are good and almost 80% of the projected annual
                           turnover for 2006 has already been secured.


rsa                        during the year we were awarded two major contracts by acsa for the upgrading of echo apron and
                           the construction of the rapid exit taxiways at johannesburg international airport. the ﬂow of work
                           from mining infrastructure contracts on both platinum and coal mines has increased and a number of
                           smaller contracts were successfully completed during the year. although hampered by bad weather and
                           tough physical conditions, the work on the berg river dam is continuing satisfactorily. good progress is
                           being made on the gardener ross, cotswold down’s, simbithi and st francis links golf estates. our
                           contract for similar work at the oubaai golf resort was successfully completed earlier this year and the
                           division is well positioned to continue in this specialised market. the major road contract from ugie to
                           langeni road in the eastern cape is well on track.

international              mozambique has successfully completed and commissioned the gas pipeline between ressano garcia
                           and matola. additional work has been secured at the massingir dam project and in the maputo
                           harbour. problems with poor materials, escalating costs triggered by the rising oil price, and ﬂuctuating
                           exchange rates have resulted in a loss being reported on our en1 road contract. all expected losses
                           have been accounted for in this ﬁnancial year. the challenge in the new ﬁnancial year in mozambique
                           is to secure the work required to meet our budget.

                           in botswana, we have completed the infrastructure contract at tonota. we are currently busy with
                           various smaller contracts at the orapa mine and in gaborone.
                           the rollcrete and rockﬁll walls for the ntimbale dam near francistown are progressing well. the
                           mbabane bypass contract in swaziland is on programme. the opencast mine activity in tanzania is
                           running well and should continue into the third quarter of the new ﬁnancial year. we have secured
                           mining infrastructure work in ghana and are looking to enlarge our footprint in this country.

                           the arbitration of our lesotho contract dispute is being heard by a panel of international arbitrators
                           and should be ﬁnalised by june 2006. no claims have been included in our results.




                                                                                         wbho annual report 2005 ■ page 11

      property development   the group’s focus on property development shifted from the development of retail space to the
                             development of township land for residential and leisure purposes in response to the market’s demand.
                             wbho has a 50% interest in both simbithi eco-estate in ballito on the kwazulu-natal north coast, and
                             in the st francis links golf estate in the eastern cape. both these projects have been well received by
                             the market and the level of sales is highly satisfactory. the group has also initiated projects in other
                             areas which will only proceed once they have proved to be sustainable. one of the key features of
                             these projects is the group’s commitment to preserving the unique natural ﬂora which occur in these
                             areas.

      concessions and ppps   we have an experienced, dedicated team in place to exploit the opportunities that arise from the
                             growing number of opportunities in private-public partnership (ppps) programmes in south africa,
                             mozambique and botswana. we regard this as a niche market that has and will generate returns that
                             reﬂect the inherent risks that relate to such projects. we are focusing on three major markets, being toll
                             roads, serviced accommodation and energy-related projects. during the year we, in various joint
                             ventures, have successfully completed, ahead of programme the r500 million dti campus project in
                             tshwane, the r2 500 million n4 platinum toll road and the r140 million gas pipeline from ressano
                             garcia to matola in mozambique. the major bidding opportunities that we will be concentrating on
                             during this coming year are two major toll roads, the new foreign affairs serviced accommodation in
                             tshwane, and a 400 km petroleum pipeline between mozambique and south africa.

corporate governance




                         wilson bayly holmes – ovcon limited is committed to the principles of integrity, accountability and
                         transparency as set out in the king report on corporate governance in south africa, 2002.

board of directors       the board comprises ﬁve directors chaired by mike wylie. three of the directors are non-executive and
                         one is also independent. the day-to-day affairs of the group are the responsibility of two of the
                         divisional managing directors. the board meets four times a year on a formal basis. the board is
                         responsible for setting strategy, determining investment policy and reviewing quarterly performance in
                         detail against previously approved budgets. the board is also responsible for identifying risk areas and
                         for monitoring them.

                         none of the directors have service contracts with the company. two of the directors retire each year by
                         rotation and re-appointment is subject to the approval of the shareholders at the annual general
                         meeting. all directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary and are entitled
                         to seek independent professional advice regarding the affairs of the company at the company’s
                         expense, should they feel that it is necessary to do so.

remuneration committee   the board has established a remuneration committee consisting of the chairman and two non-
                         executive directors. the committee is responsible for determining the remuneration packages and
                         conditions of employment of the group executive directors. the committee meets twice a year and also
                         reviews the company’s retirement funding policies and authorises allocations in terms of the company’s
                         share purchase and share option schemes. none of the directors are currently participating in the
                         company’s share schemes.

                         the group’s remuneration philosophy is to pay its directors, executives and staff competitive and
                         appropriately structured remuneration packages and to reward them over and above this by the
                         inclusion of incentive bonuses and by participation in share acquisition schemes at levels based on
                         results achieved.

audit committee          the audit committee consists of two non-executive directors, b g holmes and a j mackenzie. both the
                         head of the internal audit department and the external auditors have unrestricted access to the audit
                         committee.

                         the group’s internal controls and operating procedures are regularly reviewed and amended to suit
                         changing circumstances. the systems in place are considered to be adequate to provide reasonable
                         assurance against material loss through fraud or unauthorised use of the group’s assets and that all
                         transactions are properly authorised and recorded.

                         the audit committee set the principles for recommending the use of the external auditors for non-audit
                         services.

                         the audit committee met twice during the year and was fully attended by members.



                                                                                       wbho annual report 2005 ■ page 21

      corporate governance continued




      nomination committee     with a small board of ﬁve directors we believe the creation of a nominations committee would be
                               giving precedence to form over substance. however, the board regularly reviews the appropriateness
                               of its size and how best it can perform its duties.

      risk management          the risk management committee consists of two directors, the head of internal audit and a number
      committee                of senior executives.

                               the committee reports to the board on a regular basis setting out its evaluation of the risks faced by
                               the company and the recommended strategies for mitigating the impact thereof on the company.
                               responsibility for risk identiﬁcation, evaluation and management remains with the board.

                               the risk management committee met twice during the year and was fully attended by members.

      attendance at meetings   the board met formally four times during the year. messrs b g holmes and m w mcculloch were each
                               unable to attend one meeting. meetings of the board committees were fully attended by the respective
                               members.

      going concern            the directors are of the opinion that the business will remain a going concern in the year ahead and
                               the statement in this regard is also contained in the statement on the responsibility of the directors for
                               the annual ﬁnancial statements.

      employment equity        the group is an equal opportunity employer and no discrimination is made because of race, gender or
                               creed. we are also committed to a policy of afﬁrmative action and each divisional board has been
                               charged with the responsibility of uplifting the previously disadvantaged segments of our society and
                               for providing training for our employees so that they can develop to their full potential.

                               a variety of participative structures have been established to attend to matters concerning the well-
                               being and advancement of our employees and to ensure harmony in the workplace.

      ethics                   the group strives to conduct its business fairly and honestly and with consideration to the long-term
                               needs of all its stakeholders, whether they be customers, employees, shareholders, subcontractors,
                               suppliers or service providers.

      skills development               we comply with the requirements of the skills development act and skills development levies act.
                                       we have made a concerted effort to develop our skills plan in accordance with our equity plan and
                                       have a policy of training, developing and promoting people from within the group. training and
                                       development is implemented, with particular focus on the accelerated development of pdis, through
                                       our bursary and mentorship programmes. we have received full grant reimbursements from ceta for
                                       the planning and implementation of training programmes within the group.

      hiv/aids                         wbho has embarked on an aids awareness, counselling and testing programme with a recognised
                                       and experienced managed healthcare service provider. funding for the programme has been approved
                                       by ceta. to date a total of 1 567 employees have participated in the programme.

                                       the purpose of the programme is for employees to be informed of their hiv and tb status, to fully
                                       understand the issues surrounding hiv and to be aware of the risks.

      health, safety and quality       the group is continually trying to improve its overall health and safety standards and once again we have
                                       managed to lower the lost time injury frequency rate (ltifr). the rate was reduced by 16% from 5,0 to
                                       4,2 during the year on a substantially increased number of hours worked. this year all the sub-contractors’
                                       injury statistics have been included in the ﬁgures. unfortunately, we suffered a fatality this year when an
                                       operator overturned his vehicle. we aim to reduce our ltifr to below 4.0 in the new ﬁnancial year.

                                       in the mba regional and mbsa national safety competitions this year we received 20 top three
                                       regional awards of which three were placed ﬁrst nationally (see table on page 27).

motor vehicle and        unfortunately, this year saw our vehicle accident rate increase from 8,4 accidents per million kilometres
plant accidents          travelled to a rate of 12,3. however, the cost of these accidents increased only marginally by 0,7% to
                         r3,1 million. more emphasis will be placed on our operator/driver training and awareness programmes
                         this coming ﬁnancial year.

social investment        during the year the group has been involved in a number of social initiatives, the main one being the
                         involvement in the phutaditjaba old age and disabled care organisation who is constructing a satellite
                         clinic and community centre in the suburb of alexandra located close to our head ofﬁce. the company
                         has contributed towards the funding of the r1,6 million rehabilitation and extension of the existing
                         clinic.

                         our plant and services department in conjunction with the midrand industrial park owners association
                         has played a signiﬁcant role in building schools in the neighbouring areas of mayibuye and klipfontein.
                         we have assisted by levelling land and constructing classrooms and sport ﬁelds. assistance has also
                         been given to the unemployed in these communities so that they can grow their own food. we are also
                         exploring opportunities to provide the gauteng department of education with electronic equipment for
                         use in their various schools in alexandra.

                         preliminary discussions with other public construction companies and wits university have been held in
                         order to upgrade the laboratories in the civil engineering department. this assistance will be spread
                         over the next three years.

                         the group has maintained its policy of attempting to improve the health and general welfare of the
                         people who reside close to our construction sites wherever possible.

environmental concerns   we are committed to maintaining proper environmental practice, and are continually updating and
                         improving our systems and procedures. before arrival on sites environmental impact studies are
                         conducted, and all the conditions set out in those reports are strictly implemented. our operations are
                         monitored by the project managers and our own hse ofﬁcers.

malaria                  we are constantly ﬁghting malaria and other tropical diseases in affected areas by induction processes,
                         education of local communities, setting up clinics, and spraying communal areas located near our
                         construction sites.

                on pages 30 to 57 for the year ended 30 june 2005. these ﬁnancial statements are the
                responsibility of the company’s directors. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
                ﬁnancial statements based on our audit.


scope           we conducted our audit in accordance with statements of south african auditing standards.
                those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that
                the ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement.

                an audit includes:
                ● examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial
                   statements;
                ● assessing the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made by management;
                   and
                ● evaluating the overall ﬁnancial statement presentation.

                we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


audit opinion   in our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial
                position of the company and the group at 30 june 2005 and the results of their operations,
                movements in equity and cash ﬂows for the year then ended in accordance with south african
                statements of generally accepted accounting practice, and in the manner required by the
                companies act in south africa.

          directors’ report



         nature of business           the company is listed on the jse limited and is the holding company of a number of subsidiary
                                      companies principally engaged in civil engineering and building contracting activities in the
                                      republic of south africa and internationally.

         group results                gross revenue increased by 89,8% to r4,765 billion, giving an operating income (before goodwill
                                      impairment/amortisation) of r187,1 million which represents an increase of 59,3% over the
                                      previous year. headline earnings for the year amounted to r139,6 million (2004: r115,8 million).
                                      the consolidated income statement set out on page 33 gives further details.

         investment in subsidiaries   details of principal subsidiary companies are reﬂected on page 57. the full list of subsidiary
                                      companies is available on request from the company secretary. with effect from 1 july 2004
                                      wbho increased its holding in probuild constructions (aust) pty limited (“probuild”) from 49%
                                      to 51% of the issued shares. consequently, the results of probuild have been consolidated as
                                      opposed to being equity accounted which was formerly the case.

                                      the holding company is an investment company and consequently all proﬁts shown in the
                                      income statement were earned by subsidiary companies. losses incurred by subsidiaries
                                      amounted to r1 259 158 (2004: r117 256).

                                      dependent upon proﬁts earned and the availability of cash, the policy of the company is to pay
                                      an interim dividend in april and a ﬁnal dividend in october of each year. the ﬁnal dividend is
                                      approximately twice the value of the interim dividend. a ﬁnal dividend of 42 cents per share in
                                      respect of the 2005 year was declared on 29 august 2005. this, together with the dividend of
                                      21 cents per share at the interim stage, gives a total payment to shareholders for the year of
                                      63 cents per share (2004: 51 cents).

         share capital                there has been no change in either the authorised or the issued share capital during the year.
                                      details of the share capital are set out in note 8 of the ﬁnancial statements.

                                      the unissued ordinary shares are under the control of the directors, subject to the regulations of
                                      the jse limited, until the next annual general meeting to be held on 26 october 2005. at this
                                      meeting, shareholders will be requested to grant the directors the authority to continue to
                                      control the unissued shares until the next annual general meeting.

         share scheme                 at the start of the year 895 750 ordinary shares in wbho had been sold to eligible members
                                      of staff as determined by the board of directors. there was no change to this number during
                                      the year. a total of r4 586 239 was repaid by members during the year leaving a balance of
                                      r9 521 823 owing at the end of the year.

                                      in terms of the trust deed a further 10 202 350 shares could be issued to eligible employees.
                                      none of the directors are participants in the scheme.

                                      the trustees of “the wbho share trust” are messrs b g holmes, a j mackenzie,
                                      m w mcculloch, p g theessen and m s wylie.

                                      participants were provided interest free loans from the trust to enable them to purchase the
                                      shares offered to them.

                                      the trust is consolidated into the group annual ﬁnancial statements.

                it is the opinion of the directors that the possibility
                of any loss is improbable and it is not anticipated
                that any material liabilities will arise.

                capital commitments will be funded from internal
                cash resources of the group.

          21.   related party transactions
                during the year the group, in the ordinary course of business, entered into various sale and purchase transactions with
                joint ventures and associated companies. those transactions occurred under terms that are no less favourable than those
                arranged with third parties.

                the value of transactions is as follows:
                included in cost of sales                                    275 382            99 343                —                —

22.    financial instruments
22.1 interest rate risk
     the group is exposed to interest rate risk through its commitments in instalment sale agreements, long-term borrowings
     and accounts payable. the group manages its exposure through maintaining a reasonable accounts payable days level,
     as well as keeping favourable current bank account balances which act as a natural hedge against this exposure.

22.2 credit risk
     the group is exposed to credit risk through its investments in contract debtors, receivables and investments and loans.
     the group manages its exposure through obtaining letters of credit through approved foreign institutions where it is
     considered necessary, performing comprehensive credit checks on new clientele and obtaining collateral where
     considered necessary for loans advanced. investments which will result in material holdings are also only made once
     a thorough due diligence review has been performed.

22.3 market risk
     the group is exposed to market risk through its contracting for goods and services required to complete contracts in line
     with client speciﬁcations. this is managed by departmentalising the organisation and implementing a transfer pricing
     policy which is understood by all personnel involved, so as to achieve synergistic beneﬁts for the group as a whole.

22.4 currency risk
     the group is exposed to currency risk through its ﬁnancial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
     the group manages its exposure by creating natural hedges as a result of the existence of both foreign ﬁnancial
     assets and liabilities.

22.5 liquidity risk
     this risk is managed through the generation and maintenance of adequate cash forecasts as well as the long-standing
     relationship that exists between the group’s bankers and itself. in addition, the group is in a cash positive position
     and has been so historically for many years.

22.6 fair values
     financial assets and liabilities are disclosed at carrying values which, in all material respects, approximate their fair values.

22.7 uncovered monetary assets
     the following uncovered monetary assets existed at year-end.

                                                                                amount               exchange

                  the principal actuarial assumptions used as at the balance sheet date were as
                  follows:
                  discount rate                                                                               8,5%             9,5%
                  inﬂation rate                                                                               4,0%             5,0%
                  salary increase rate                                                                        6,0%             6,5%

                  these assumptions have been based on the requirements of the reporting standard, and are typically less conservative
                  than those used by the valuator for funding purposes. all other assumptions adopted in the funding valuation were
                  left unchanged.
                c) deﬁned contribution funds
                   – wbho staff provident fund
                     the fund is open to all full time monthly paid employees of the company.
                   – wbho provident fund
                     the fund is open to membership by any hourly paid employee employed full time by the company and who has
                     completed at least 12 months’ continuous service.

          proxy continued



         notes

          1. this proxy form is to be completed only by those shareholders who still hold shares in a certificated form or whose
             shares are recorded in their “own name” in a dematerialised electronic form in the sub-register.

          2. shareholders whose dematerialised shares are held in the name of a nominee and wish to attend the annual general
             meeting, must contact their central securities depository participant (“csdp”) or broker who will furnish them with the
             necessary letter of representation. alternatively, they have to instruct their csdp or broker as to how they wish to vote.
             this has to be done in accordance with the agreement between the shareholder and the csdp or broker.

          3. dematerialised shareholders, other than those with “own name” registration who wish to attend and vote at the
             meeting, must ensure that their letters of representation from their csdp or broker reach the transfer secretaries by no
             later than 11:00 on monday, 24 october 2005.

          4. a shareholder may insert the name of a proxy or the names of two alternative proxies of the shareholder’s choice in the
             space provided.

             the person whose name stands first on the form of proxy and who is present at the general meeting will be entitled to
             act as proxy to the exclusion of those whose names follow.

          5. a shareholder’s instructions to the proxy must be indicated by the insertion of the relevant number of votes exercisable
             by the shareholder in the appropriate box provided. failure to comply with the above will be deemed to authorise the
             proxy to vote or to abstain from voting at the general meeting as he/she deems fit in respect of all the shareholder’s
             votes exercisable thereat.

             a shareholder or the proxy is not obliged to use all the votes exercisable by the shareholder or by the proxy, but the
             total of the votes cast and in respect of which abstention is recorded may not exceed the total of the votes exercisable
             by the shareholder or by the proxy.

          6. forms of proxy must be lodged with or posted to the company secretary of wbho, 53 andries street, wynberg,
             sandton, 2090 (po box 531, bergvlei, 2012) to reach him by no later than 11:00 on monday, 24 october 2005.

          7. the completion and lodging of this form of proxy will not preclude the relevant shareholder from attending the general
             meeting and speaking and voting in person thereat to the exclusion of any proxy appointed in terms thereof.

          8. documentary evidence establishing the authority of a person signing this form in a representative or other legal
             capacity must be attached to this form of proxy unless previously recorded by the transfer secretaries of wbho or
             waived by the chairman of the general meeting.

          9. any alteration or correction made to this form of proxy must be initialled by the signatory/ies.

         10. if any shares are jointly held, the first name appearing in the register shall, in the event of any dispute, be taken as the
             shareholder.
