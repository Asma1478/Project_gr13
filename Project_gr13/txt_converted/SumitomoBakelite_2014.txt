                    environmental protection and safety

                                     we have inherited sumitomo’s business philosophy that has supported the sumitomo group for four centuries.
                                       the origins of this philosophy are found in the monjuin shiigaki (the founder’s precepts), a document written
                                     by sumitomo family founder masatomo sumitomo (who acquired the title monjuin after becoming a buddhist
                                     priest) to instruct his family about the business wisdom he had distilled from his experience.
                                       at the beginning, it urges “strive with all your heart, not only in business, but in all situations.” this is the
                     sumitomo’s      fundamental spirit of the monjuin shiigaki.

          academic ability and awareness of scientific subjects have identified
          a drift away from science in developed countries. japan is no
          exception to this trend. this raises the concern that japan’s strengths
          in manufacturing and innovation will be endangered.
           in order to address this situation, sumitomo bakelite started the fujieda
          science education support project in 2009, to support science teachers
          who are the true education professionals. we wanted show teachers
          directly the significance and role of science in the real world so that they
                                                                                                 managing executive officer
          can convey this to children who will be responsible for the future of
                                                                                                 director, r&d headquarters

          2013 shizuoka plant biotope project

   based on the results of an ecosystem survey conducted in fiscal 2011, the company started to
   develop a biotope from fiscal 2012. in fiscal 2013, we planted native species on irodori no oka,
   developed a nesting area for kingfishers, and established deep and shallow wetlands. after about one
   year, the wetland is now home to various life-forms. we’re looking forward to watching it develop.

equipment risks
beginning in 2008 at plants and subsidiaries and affiliates
in japan and in 2009 at overseas subsidiaries and affiliates,
new machinery and equipment has been designed to
comply with iso 12100. we are also systematically
improving existing equipment based on the results of risk
assessment.


                                                                         sumitomo bakelite (taiwan)             rescue training

reducing chemical substances risks
since 2012, plants in japan and subsidiaries and affiliates
worldwide have been systematically conducting risk
assessment of chemical substances based on sdss.
improvement measures are being implemented, in light of
the results of risk assessment, in order to prevent exposure
of employees to health hazards.

in parallel with measures to reduce the risks posed by
machinery and equipment, we conduct risk prediction
training as well as initiatives such as “pointing and calling”
and other methods of confirming safety. the objectives of
these activities include increasing awareness of possible
dangers and eliminating risky behavior.

                                                          co2 emissions are calculated based on the energy used in all our business operations (fuels, heat, electricity, etc.).
                                                          the emissions calculation method used is based on the manual for calculating/reporting greenhouse gas emissions (march 2009, ministry of the

                           agreements, administrative guidance, and other requirements issued by governmental authorities.

                        2. in the case of overseas business sites, the applicable standards are shown, but, because laws may differ from one country
                           to another, these figures include national and regional regulatory limits, agreement standards, autonomous control
                           standards, reference standards, and other types of standards. in addition, at some business sites, data has been compiled
                           for the january-to-december period of calendar 2013.

3. the measured data are the maximum level recorded in fiscal 2013, unless otherwise indicated in the notes. please note that,
  in the case of ph figures, the minimum and maximum levels are shown. in addition, when actual measurements are below
  the quantifiable limits, the amounts are shown as “less than (the quantifiable limit).” when the substances in question was
  less than the lower detection limit, the amount is shown as “not detected”; those listed as “－” indicate no measurement.

4. where“－” (a dash) is shown for the regulatory limit, the figures obtained by voluntary measurement are shown for
