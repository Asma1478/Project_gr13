by another postal operator (20 million eur), delays
in 2013 of payments by state entities (11.2 million

investing activities generate a cash outflow of
80.7 million eur compared to 88.1 million eur last

gaap figures from the ifrs figures and is achieved
by reversing all ifrs adjustments made to local gaap

   gaap while ifrs requires impairment testing for

   criteria under belgian gaap and ifrs.
•  ifrs requires that all future obligations to
   personnel be recorded as a liability under ias 19,

sustainable mobility

our fleet of vehicles is also at the heart of our
environmental challenge. it is one of the largest in
belgium, comprising 6,466 vans, 2,180 mopeds, 412
trucks, 3,140 bicycles, 2,524 electric bicycles and
10 electric delivery three-wheelers. at the end of
2013, this fleet accounted for almost 70% of our
direct carbon footprint. the introduction of e-bikes
to replace mopeds was a first stage in upgrading
our vehicle fleet. the second stage will be to
replace vans with electric delivery three-wheelers

* due to the restatement for ias 19r, other reserves decreased by 10.9 million eur


other reserves per december 31, 2013 (111.0 million eur) are composed of group reserves
amounting to 60.2 million eur and legal reserves of 50.8 million eur.

the amount under “other comprehensive income” relates mainly to the unrealized gains and losses
on the bond portfolio of bpost bank (see also note 6.20 for more details) and the unrealized losses
on post-employment benefits due to ias 19r (see also note 6.25 for more details).

the main elements in “other” are the purchase of the remaining shares of msi leading to a
reduction in equity of 3.4 million eur offset by the additional issue premium of 12.5 million eur
paid by bnp paribas fortis in connection with the capital increase by bpost bank.

on may 23, 2013 bpost announced its intention to proceed with an initial public offering and
listing of its ordinary shares on nyse euronext in brussels (the “ipo”).

at the same time, the shareholders’ meeting decided to split the shares in proportion of 488 per 1
and to remove the classes of shares.

concurrently, bpost implemented a share purchase plan for bpost’s employees. eligible participants
were able to purchase a fixed number of shares at a price representing a discount of 16.67% to the
offer price. 916,479 shares were sold to bpost’s employees.

on june 21, 2013, the trading of bpost’s shares started on euronext brussels.

the belgian state did not sell shares and maintains its 50.01% participation in bpost (directly and
through the sfpi/fpim). as at december 31, 2013, post invest europe sàrl, which was the other
shareholder prior to the ipo, had disposed of substantially all its shares and holds a remaining
number of 4,062 shares.

the shares have no nominal value and are fully paid up.

6. notes to the consolidated financial statements
6.1     general information
business activities

bpost and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as ‘bpost’) provide national and international mail
and parcels services comprising the collection, transport, sorting and distribution of addressed and
non-addressed mail, printed documents, newspapers and parcels.

bpost, through its subsidiaries and business units, also sells a range of other products and services,
including postal, parcels, banking and financial products, express delivery services, document
management and related activities. bpost also carries out services of general economic interest
(sgei) on behalf of the belgian state.

legal status

bpost is a limited-liability company under public law. bpost has its registered office at the
muntcentrum-centre monnaie, 1000 brussels.


6.2      change in accounting
the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for
the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective as from january 1, 2013.

ias 19 revised includes a number of amendments to the accounting for defined benefit plans,
including actuarial gains and losses that are now recognized in other comprehensive income (oci)
and permanently excluded from profit and loss. other amendments don’t have an impact on bpost
or simply include new disclosures, such as, quantitative sensitivity disclosures.

the transition to ias 19 revised had an impact on the net post-employment benefit obligations of
bpost due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses (for those which occur as from january
1, 2013 and for those unrecognized at december 31, 2012) in other comprehensive income. bpost
previously recognized only the cumulative actuarial gains and losses, which exceeded 10% of the
greater of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets, over two years.

the effect of the adoption of ias 19 revised is explained in note 6.25 and requires restatement of
previous financial statements.

the following new standards and amendments, entered into force as from january 1, 2013, don’t
have any effect on the presentation, the financial performance or position of bpost:
• ias 1 – presentation of items of other comprehensive income
• ifrs 13 – fair value measurement
• ifrs 7 – financial instruments: disclosures – offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
• ifric 20 – stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine
• improvements to ifrs - 2009-2011 cycle:
  - ifrs 1 – repeat application and borrowing costs
  - ias 1 – clarification of the requirement for comparative information
  - ias 16 – classification of servicing equipment
  - ias 32 – tax effects of distributions to holders of equity instruments
  - ias 34 – interim financial reporting and segment information for total assets and liabilities

6.3       significant accounting judgments and estimates
a series of significant accounting judgments underlie the preparation of ifrs compliant
consolidated financial statements. they impact the value of assets and liabilities. estimates and
assumptions are made concerning the future. they are re-assessed on a continuous basis and are
based on historically established patterns and expectations with regards to future events that
appear reasonable under the existing circumstances.

employee benefits - ias 19

the key assumptions, inherent to the valuation of employee benefit liabilities and the
determination of the pension cost, include employee turnover, mortality rates and retirement
ages, discount rates, benefit increases and future wage increases, which are updated on an annual
basis. given the increase of the reference database with each year of historical data that is
added, the data become ever more stable and reliable. actual circumstances may vary from these




88

assumptions, giving rise to different employee benefit liabilities, which would be reflected as an
additional proﬁt or cost in the income statement.

regarding the accumulated compensated absences benefit, as at december 31, 2013, the
consumption pattern of the illness days was derived from the statistics of the consumption
average over the years 2011 to 2013. the number of days of illness depends on the age, identified
per segment of the relevant population. since 2010, the rate of guaranteed salary has been
set at 75% in case of long-term illness. thus, the percentage of the guaranteed salary used for
determining the cost of days accumulated in the notional account is 25%.

under the collective labor agreement for the years 2012-2013 signed in march 2012, the balance
of the cumulated un-used sickness days for civil servants is limited to a maximum of 63 days
instead of 300 days previously.

measurement of the group insurance plan is consistent with the so-called d9 approach. this
is in line with the progress made on september 10, 2013 by the ifric on “the measurement
alternative(s) to be considered in developing a proposal on accounting for contribution-based
plans with a guaranteed return”. however, the ifric is still in an early discussion phase.

for most benefits, an average cost per inactive member is used for the valuation of the benefits.
this average cost has been estimated by dividing the annual cost for inactive members by
the number of inactive beneficiaries based on the reference data received from the pensions’
administration.

the discount rates have been determined by reference to market yields at the statement of
financial position date. since 2010, bpost used the towers watson tool for the determination of
the discount rates, considering a mix of financial and non financial aa corporate bonds.

fair value measurement of financial instruments

contingent consideration, resulting from business combinations, is valued at fair value at the
acquisition date as part of the business combination. when the contingent consideration meets
the definition of a financial liability, it is subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting
date. the determination of the fair value is based on discounted cash flows. the key assumptions
take into consideration the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount
factor.


6.4      summary of significant accounting policies
the consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors on march 26,
2014 and have been prepared using the measurement basis specified by the international financial
reporting standards (ifrs). the measurement bases are described in detail in the next paragraphs.

the consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (eur) and all values are rounded to
the nearest million except when otherwise indicated.

all accounting estimates and assumptions that are used in preparing the financial statements are
consistent with bpost’s latest approved budget / long-term plan projections, where applicable.
judgments are based on the information available on each statement of financial position date.




                                                                               annual report
                                                                                         2013        89

although these estimates are based on the best information available to the management, actual
results may ultimately differ from those estimates.

consolidation

the parent company and all the subsidiaries it controls are included in the consolidation. no
exception is permitted.

subsidiaries

assets and liabilities, rights and commitments, income and charges of the parent and the
subsidiaries fully controlled are consolidated in full. control is the power to govern the financial
and operating policies of an entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities. control is
assumed to exist when bpost holds at least 50%, plus one share of the entity’s voting power; these
assumptions may be rebutted if there is clear evidence to the contrary. the existence and effect of
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing
whether bpost controls an entity.

consolidation of a subsidiary takes place from the date of acquisition, which is the date on which
control of the net assets and operations of the acquiree is effectively transferred to the acquirer.
from the date of acquisition, the parent (the acquirer) incorporates into the consolidated income
statement the financial performance of the acquiree and recognizes in the consolidated statement
of financial position the acquired assets and liabilities (at fair value), including any goodwill arising
on the acquisition. subsidiaries are de-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.
intragroup balances and transactions, as well as unrealized gains and losses on transactions
between group companies are eliminated in full.

consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like
transactions and other events in similar circumstances.

associates

an associate is an entity in which bpost has significant influence, but which is neither a subsidiary
nor a joint venture. significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating
policy decisions of the investee but not to control those policies. it is assumed to exist when
bpost holds at least 20% of the investee’s voting power but not to exist when less than 20% is
held; these assumptions may be rebutted if there is clear evidence to the contrary.

consistent accounting policies are applied throughout the whole group, including associates.

all associates are accounted for using the equity method: the participating interests are separately
included in the consolidated statement of financial position (under the caption “investments in
associates”) at the closing date at an amount corresponding to the proportion of the associate’s
equity (as restated under ifrs), including the result for the period. dividends received from an
investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.

the portion of the result of associates attributable to bpost is included separately in the
consolidated income statement under the caption “share of result of associates (equity method)”.

unrealized profits and losses resulting from transactions between an investor (or its consolidated




90

subsidiaries) and associates are eliminated to the extent of the investor’s interest in the associate.

bpost bank is an associate and is accounted for using the equity method as bpost has significant
influence but does not control the management of the company.

the bond portfolio of bpost bank is classified as “available-for-sale financial assets”. the bonds
include:
• fixed income securities (bonds, negotiable debt instruments, sovereign loans in the form of
   securities, etc.);
•  variable income securities;
•   fixed and/or variable income securities containing embedded derivatives (which are accounted
     for separately if necessary).

securities classified in “available-for-sale financial assets” are measured at fair value and changes
in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income under a specific heading “unrealized or
deferred gains or losses.”

for fixed income securities, interest is recognized in the income statement using the effective
interest rate method. for variable income securities, revenues are recorded in profit or loss as soon
as the shareholders general meeting confirms the distribution of a dividend.

goodwill and negative acquisition differences

where an entity is acquired, the difference recorded on the date of acquisition between the
acquisition cost of the investment and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities acquired is accounted for as goodwill (if the difference is positive) or directly
as a profit in the income statement (if the difference is negative).

contingent consideration, if any, is measured at fair value at the time of the business combination
and included in the consideration transferred (i.e. recognized within goodwill). if the amount
of contingent consideration changes as a result of a post-acquisition event (such as meeting an
earnings target), the change in fair value is recognized in profit or loss.

goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually.

intangible assets

an intangible asset is recognized on the consolidated statement of financial position sheet when
the following conditions are met:
(i)	the asset is identifiable, i.e. either separable (if it can be sold, transferred, licensed) or it results
       from contractual or legal rights;
(ii)	it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset
       will flow to bpost;
(iii)	bpost can control the resource; and
(iv)	the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

intangible fixed assets are carried at acquisition cost (including the costs directly attributable
to the transaction, but not indirect overheads) less any accumulated amortization and less any
accumulated impairment loss. the expenses in relation to the research phase are charged to the
income statement. the expenses in relation to the development phase are capitalized. within
bpost, internally generated intangible assets represent mainly it projects.




                                                                                   annual report
                                                                                             2013         91

intangible assets are amortized on a systematic basis over their useful life, using the straight-line
method. the applicable useful lives are:
  intangible assets                                                                                             useful life

property, plant and equipment

property, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition cost, less any accumulated depreciation
and less any accumulated impairment loss. cost includes any directly attributable cost of bringing
the asset to working condition for its intended use.

expenditure on repair and maintenance which serve only to maintain, but not increase, the value
of fixed assets are charged to the income statement. however, expenditures on major repair and
major maintenance, which increases the future economic benefits that will be generated by the
fixed asset, are identified as a separate element of the acquisition cost.

borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset
that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are
capitalized as part of the cost of the asset.

the depreciable amount is allocated on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset, using
the straight-line method. the depreciable amount is the acquisition cost, except for vehicles. for
vehicles, it is the acquisition cost less the residual value of the asset at the end of its useful life.
the applicable useful lives are:
  property, plant and equipment                                                                                 useful life

lease transactions

a finance lease, which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership to
the lessee, is recognized as an asset and a liability at amounts equal to the present value of the
minimum lease payments (= sum of capital and interest portions included in the lease payments)
or, if lower, the fair value of the leased assets. lease payments are apportioned between the
finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability in order to obtain a constant rate
of interest on the debt over the lease term. the depreciation policy for leased assets is consistent
with that for similar assets owned.




92

rentals paid/received under operating lease (ones that do not transfer substantially all the risks
and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset) are recognized as an expense by the lessee/ as an
income by the lessor on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

investment properties

investment property mainly relates to apartments located in buildings used as post offices.

investment properties are carried at acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and less
any impairment loss. the depreciation amount is allocated on a systematic basis over the useful
life of the asset, using the straight-line method. the applicable useful lives can be found in the
table that is included in section “property, plant and equipment”.

assets held for sale

non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale under a separate heading in the statement
of financial position if their carrying amount is recovered principally through sale rather than
through continuing use. this is demonstrated if certain strict criteria are met (active program to
locate a buyer has been initiated, property is available for immediate sale in its present condition,
sale is highly probable and is expected to occur within one year from the date of classification).

non-current assets held for sale are no longer depreciated but may be impaired. they are stated at
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

stamp collection

the stamp collection that is owned by bpost and used durably by it is stated at the re-evaluated
amount less discount for the lack of liquidity. the revalued amounts are determined periodically
on the basis of market prices. bpost proceeds to the reevaluation of its collection every five years.
the stamp collection is recorded in the caption “other property, plant and equipment” of the
statement of financial position.

impairment of assets

an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell (corresponding to the cash that
bpost can recover through sale) and its value in use (corresponding to the cash that bpost can
recover if it continues to use the asset).

when possible, the tests have been performed on individual assets. when however it is determined
that assets do not generate independent cash flows, the test is performed at the level of the cash-
generating unit (cgu) to which the asset belongs (cgu = the smallest identifiable group of assets
that generates inflows that are largely independent from the cash flows from other cgus).

an impairment test is carried out annually for a cgu to which goodwill is allocated. for a cgu to
which no goodwill is allocated, impairment test is only carried out when there is an indication of
impairment. for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination
is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units, or groups of cash-
generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.




                                                                             annual report
                                                                                       2013        93

where an impairment is identified, it is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the cgu. any excess is then allocated to reduce the carrying amount of
other fixed assets of the cgu in proportion to their book values, but solely to the extent that the
selling price of the assets in question is lower than their carrying amount.

impairment on goodwill may never be reversed at a later date. impairment on other fixed assets is
reversed if the initial conditions that prevailed at the time the impairment was recorded cease to
exist, and solely to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the amount
that would have been obtained, after depreciation, had no impairment been recorded.

inventories

inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value at the statement of financial
position date.

the acquisition price of interchangeable inventories is determined by application of the fifo
method. inventories of minor importance whose value and composition remain stable over time
are stated in the statement of financial position at a fixed value.

the cost of inventories comprises all costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present
location and condition, including indirect production costs. the cost price of stamps includes the
direct and indirect costs of production, excluding costs of borrowing and overheads that do not
contribute to bringing them to the present location and condition. the allocation of fixed costs of
production to the cost price is based on normal production capacity.

a write-down is necessary when the net realizable value at the statement of financial position date
is lower than the cost.

share based payments

the stock option plan is measured using valuation techniques based on option pricing models.
under these models, the options are measured at fair value on the grant date. the option price
thus calculated is recognized in the income statement under the section “payroll costs” and spread
over the term of the options.

revenue recognition

revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognized when bpost transfers the significant risks and
rewards of ownership to the buyer and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with
the transaction will flow to the entity.

revenue from the rendering of services is recognized according to the stage of completion of
the services rendered. in application of this principle, the revenue relative to the stamp sale and
franking machine activity is recognized in income at the time the mail is delivered.

the remuneration of the sgei is based on the contractual provisions of the management contract
and the revenue is recognized when the services are rendered.

bpost also receives commissions on sales of partner products through its network of post offices.
commission income is recorded at the time the services are provided.




94

interest income is recognized using the effective yield method and the revenue related to
dividends is recognized when the group’s right to receive the payment is established. rental
income arising from operating leases or investment properties is accounted for on a straight line
basis over the lease term.

receivables

receivables are initially measured at their fair value and later at their amortized cost, i.e. the
present value of the cash flows to be received (unless the impact of discounting is not significant).

an individual assessment of the recoverability of the receivables is made. impairment is recognized
where cash settlement is wholly or partially doubtful or uncertain.

prepayments and accrued income are also presented under this caption.

investment securities

financial assets are assigned to the different categories on initial recognition, depending on the
characteristics of the instrument and its purpose. a financial instrument’s category is relevant for
the way it is measured and whether any resulting income and expenses is recognized in profit or
loss or directly in equity.

there are different categories of financial assets:
(1)	financial assets held for trading include (a) derivatives and (b) assets that bpost has voluntarily
   decided to classify in the category “at fair value through profit or loss” at the time of initial
   recognition. these financial assets are measured at their fair value at each statement of financial
   position date, changes in fair value being recognized in the income statement.
(2)	held-to-maturity financial assets are financial assets, other than derivatives, with fixed or
   determinable payments and fixed maturity dates, which bpost has the positive intention and
   ability to hold to maturity. these assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective
   interest method.
(3)	loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
   that are not quoted in an active market. after initial recognition these are measured at
   amortized cost using the effective interest method.
(4)	available-for-sale financial assets constitute a residual category that includes all the financial
   assets not classified under one of the previous categories, for instance investments in equity
   instruments (other than shares in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates),
   investments in open-ended mutual funds and bonds that bpost has neither the intention nor
   the ability to hold to maturity. these available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair
   value, with changes in fair value recognized directly in equity until the financial assets are
   derecognized, at which time the cumulative gains or losses previously recognized in equity are
   recycled in profit or loss.

regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and de-recognized using
settlement date accounting. the fair values of the financial assets are determined by reference to
published price quotations in an active market.




                                                                              annual report
                                                                                        2013        95

cash and cash equivalents

this caption includes cash in hand, at bank, values for collection, short-term investments (with
maturity date not exceeding three months as from acquisition date) that are highly liquid and are
readily convertible into a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of
changes in value.

for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of
cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

share capital

ordinary shares are classified under the caption “issued capital”.

treasury shares are deducted from equity. movements of treasury shares do not affect the income
statement.

other reserves comprise the results of the previous periods, the legal reserve and the consolidated
reserve.

retained earnings include the result of the current period as disclosed in the income statement.

employee benefits

short-term benefits

short-term benefits are recognized as an expense when an employee has rendered the services to
bpost. benefits not paid for on the statement of financial position date are included under the
caption “payroll and social security payables”.

post-employment benefits

post-employment benefits are valued using an actuarial valuation method and provisions are set
up for them (under deduction of any plan assets) in so far as bpost has an obligation to incur
the costs in relation to these benefits. this obligation can be a legal, contractual or constructive
obligation (“vested rights” on the basis of past practice).

in application of these principles, a provision (calculated according to an actuarial method laid
down by ias 19) is set up in the context of the post-employment benefits to cover:
•  the future costs relative to current retirees (a provision representing 100% of the future
   estimated costs of those retirees);
•  the future costs of potential retirees, estimated on the basis of the employees currently in
   service, taking account of the accumulated service of these employees on each statement of
   financial position date and the probability that the personnel will reach the desired age to
   obtain the benefits (the provision is constituted progressively, as and when members of the
   personnel advance in their careers).

re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the statement
of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through oci in the
period in which they occur. re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.




96

actuarial assumptions (concerning the discount rate, mortality factor, costs of future benefits, inflation,
etc.) are used to assess employee benefit obligations in conformity with ias 19. actuarial gains and
losses inevitably appear, resulting (1) from changes in the actuarial assumptions year on year, and (2)
deviations between actual costs and actuarial assumptions used for the ias 19 valuation. until 2012,
bpost had opted to recognize actuarial gains and losses in applying the corridor approach.

the calculation of the obligation is done using the projected unit credit method. each year of
service confers entitlement to an additional credit unit to be taken into account in valuing the
benefits granted and the obligations pertaining thereto. the discount rate used is the yield of
high-quality corporate bonds or is based on government bonds with a maturity similar to that of
the benefits being valued.

service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments
and non-routine settlements.

past service costs resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment should be recognized at
the earlier of the date when (1) the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (2) the entity
recognizes related restructuring costs in accordance with ias 37. past service costs are recognized
in the income statement.

net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or
assets. net interest costs are also recognized in the income statement.

the plan assets related to the post-employment benefits are measured at their fair value at the
end of the period in the same definition used in ifrs 13.

long-term benefits

long-term employee benefits are valued using an actuarial valuation method and provisions are
set up for them (under deduction of any plan assets) in so far as bpost has an obligation to incur
the costs in relation to these benefits. this obligation can be a legal, contractual or constructive
obligation (“vested rights” on the basis of past practice).

a provision is created for long-term benefits to cover benefits that will only be paid in a number
of years but that are already earned by the employee on the basis of the past service. here, as well,
the provision is calculated according to an actuarial method imposed by ias 19.

the provision is calculated as follows:
    actuarial valuation of the obligation under ias 19
– fair value of the plan assets
= 	provision to be constituted (or asset to be recognized if the fair value of the plan assets is higher).

re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately through
profit or loss in the period in which they occur.

actuarial assumptions (concerning the discount rate, mortality factor, costs of future benefits,
inflation, etc.) are used to assess employee benefit obligations in conformity with ias 19. actuarial
gains and losses inevitably appear, resulting (1) from changes in the actuarial assumptions year
on year, and (2) deviations between actual costs and actuarial assumptions used for the ias 19
valuation. these actuarial gains and losses are recognized directly in the income statement.




                                                                                 annual report
                                                                                           2013        97

the calculation of the obligation is done using the projected unit credit method. each year of
service confers entitlement to an additional credit unit to be taken into account in valuing the
benefits granted and the obligations pertaining thereto. the discount rate used is the yield of high-
quality corporate bonds or alternatively is based on government bonds with a maturity similar to
that of the benefits being valued.

service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments
and non-routine settlements.

past service costs resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment should be recognized at
the earlier of the date when (1) the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (2) the entity
recognizes related restructuring costs in accordance with ias 37. past service costs are recognized
in the income statement.

net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or
assets. net interest costs are recognized in the income statement.

termination benefits

where bpost terminates the contract of a member of its personnel prior to his normal retirement
date or where an offer of benefits is made in return for the termination of employment that can
no longer be withdrawn, a provision is constituted in so far as there is an obligation on bpost.

provisions

a provision is recognized only when:
(1) bpost has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of past events;
(2) it is probable (more likely than not) that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
     obligation; and
(3) a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.

where the impact is likely to be material (mainly for long-term provisions), the provision is
estimated on a net present value basis. the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is
recognized as a financial expense.

a provision for restoring polluted sites is recognized if bpost has an obligation in this respect.
provisions for future operating losses are prohibited.

if bpost has an onerous contract (the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the
contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it), the present obligation
under the contract is recognized as a provision.

a provision for restructuring is only recorded if bpost demonstrates a constructive obligation
to restructure at the statement of financial position date. the constructive obligation should be
demonstrated by: (a) a detailed formal plan identifying the main features of the restructuring; and
(b) raising a valid expectation to those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting
to implement the plan or by announcing its main features to those affected.

dividends payable in respect of year n are only recognized as liabilities once the shareholders’
rights to receive these dividends (during the course of year n+1) are established.




98

income taxes

income tax includes current taxation and deferred taxation. current taxation is the amount
of taxes to be paid (recovered) on the taxable income for the current year together with any
adjustment in the taxes paid (to be recovered) in relation to previous years. it is calculated using
the rate of tax on the statement of financial position date.

deferred taxation is calculated according to the liability method on the temporary differences
arising between the carrying amount of the statement of financial position items and their tax
base, using the rate of tax expected to apply when the asset is recovered or the liability is settled.
in practice, the rate in force on the statement of financial position date is used.

deferred taxes are not recognized in respect of:
(1) goodwill that is not amortized for tax purposes;
(2) the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination
     and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit; and
(3) investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures if it is likely that dividends
     will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

a deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference
can be utilized. the same principles apply to recognition of deferred tax assets for unused tax
losses carried forward. this criterion is reassessed on each statement of financial position date.

deferred taxes are calculated at the level of each fiscal entity. the deferred tax assets and liabilities
of various subsidiaries may not be presented on a net basis

deferred revenue

deferred revenue is the portion of income received during the current or prior financial periods
but which relates to a subsequent financial period.

transactions in foreign currencies

transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the entities
concerned using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. realized exchange
rate gains and losses and non-realized exchange rate gains and losses on monetary assets and
liabilities on the statement of financial position date are recognized in the income statement.

on consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into euros at the
rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their income statements are translated
at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. the exchange differences arising
on translation for consolidation are recognized in other comprehensive income. on disposal of
a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular
foreign operation is recognized in profit or loss.

derivative financial instruments

derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
the income statement.




                                                                               annual report
                                                                                         2013        99

special rules may apply in the case of hedging transactions by means of derivatives, but bpost
has not entered into this type of transactions nor does it enter into speculative - type derivatives
transactions.

6.5     risk management
any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position,
results of operation and liquidities. the risks described below are not the only risks that the
company is facing. there may be additional risks to the ones described below which the company
is currently unaware of. there may be also risks that are currently believed to be immaterial, but
which may ultimately have a material adverse effect in the long run.

risks relating to the regulatory and legislative framework

the company operates in markets which are heavily regulated, including by national, eu and
global regulatory bodies. bpost is therefore subject to significant regulations in belgium and in
other jurisdictions. it is uncertain whether belgian or european regulators or third parties will raise
material issues with regard to bpost’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations or whether
future legislative, regulatory or judicial changes or other regulatory developments will have a
material adverse effect on bpost’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

changes to the law of march 21, 1991 on public autonomous enterprises (“the 1991 law”) and the
existing and future regulations implementing the 1991 law could adversely affect bpost. it is not
possible to predict any changes to the 1991 law or any of its implementing regulations, including
regarding the licensing conditions that a new entrant is required to satisfy to provide letter mail
services falling within the scope of the uso.

following the state aid investigation launched by the european commission in 2009, the company
was required to repay alleged state aid in respect of the period from 1992 to 2012. on may 2,
2013, the european commission approved the compensation granted to the company under
the terms of the 5th management contract covering the period from 2013 to 2015. no appeal
was initiated against the european commission’s decision. although the european commission’s
decisions on state aid provide the company with a degree of certainty regarding the compatibility
of the compensation it receives for the provision of services of public economic interest (“sgeis”)
with state aid rules for the period from 1992 through 2015, it cannot be excluded that the
company could be subject to further state aid allegations and investigations in respect of this
period in relation to sgeis, other public services and other services it performs for the belgian
state and various public entities.

pursuant to the 5th management contract and the 1991 law, the company will continue to be
the provider of certain sgeis through december 31, 2015. in respect of the period commencing
january 1, 2016, the belgian state may cease to provide (or amend the scope and content of)
certain public services, may conclude that such services do not constitute sgeis and hence do not
warrant compensation or may not entrust these services to the company.

the belgian state has committed to the european commission that it will organize a competitive,
transparent and non-discriminatory tendering procedure, with a view to awarding by the end
of 2014 a service concession at national level in respect of the distribution of newspapers and
periodicals in belgium. the successful candidate in this tender process will be entitled to begin
providing such services as of january 1, 2016. the belgian state has also committed to the
european commission that it will reassess the approach for the entrustment of the other sgeis

set forth in the 5th management contract and in the 1991 law for the period after december 31,
2015.

the company may be required to provide other postal operators with access to specific elements
of its postal infrastructure or certain services, such as post boxes, information on change of
address, re-direction and return to sender services. it may be required to provide access at
uneconomic price levels or the access conditions imposed upon it may otherwise be onerous. in
the event it fails to comply with this requirement, it may also be subject to fines and/or other
operators may initiate proceedings seeking damages in national courts.

the company is required to demonstrate that its pricing for the services falling within the uso
complies with the principles of affordability, cost orientation, transparency, non-discrimination
and uniformity of tariffs. tariff increases for certain single piece mail and uso parcels are subject
to a price cap formula (which inter alia depends on bpost reaching defined quality of service
targets) and prior control by the ibpt/bipt and the ibpt/bipt may refuse to approve such tariffs
or tariff increases if they are not in compliance with the aforementioned principles or price cap
formula. in addition, in relation to activities for which bpost is deemed to have a dominant market
position, its pricing must not constitute an abuse of such dominant position. failure to observe
this requirement may result in fines. bpost may also be ordered by national courts to discontinue
certain commercial practices or to pay damages to third parties.

it cannot be excluded that in the future “ex ante” price regulations which would further restrict
the commercial freedom of the company, will be introduced in (mail or parcel) markets where the
company would be deemed to have “significant market power”.

the company is also subject to the requirement of no cross-subsidization between public services
on the one hand and commercial services on the other hand. in addition, according to state aid
rules, if the company engages in commercial services, the business case for providing such services
must comply with the “private investor test,” that is, the company must be able to demonstrate
that a private investor would have made the same investment decision. if these principles are not
complied with, the european commission could find that commercial services have benefited from
unlawful state aid and order the recovery of this state aid from the company.

the company was designated by the belgian state as a uso provider for an eight-year term
commencing in 2011. the obligation to provide the uso may represent a financial burden on the
company. although the 1991 law provides that the company is entitled to compensation by the
belgian state in the event the uso has created an unfair burden, there can be no assurance that
the entire net cost of the uso will be covered. furthermore, going forward, if the company were
to be designated as a uso provider, there is uncertainty regarding the terms and conditions and
financing mechanism that would apply to the provision of the uso.

the interaction between the laws applicable to all private limited liability companies and the
specific public law provisions and principles applicable to the company may present difficulties in
interpretation and cause legal uncertainty. for instance bpost is subject to certain specific risks in
relation to employment matters deriving from the application of certain public law provisions and
principles. in particular, bpost is involved in litigation initiated by a number of auxiliary postmen
(which include all postmen recruited from january 1, 2010 performing certain core functions such
as collection, sorting, transport and distribution of mail).




                                                                             annual report
                                                                                       2013     101

bpost’s contractual employees could also challenge their employment status and claim damages
to compensate them for being deprived of statutory employment protection and benefits.
amendments to, or the introduction of new, legislation and regulations, including legislation and
regulations relating to state pensions, could result in additional burdens for bpost. there can also
be no assurance that the company will not face challenges regarding certain employment matters
on state aid grounds.

bpost is subject to transport regulations at international, eu, national and regional levels and
failure to comply with such regulations could result in fines or the suspension or revocation of
licenses.

regulatory changes may impact the attractiveness of mail and parcels as a communication means
and hence bpost’s turnover. for instance the introduction of vat on most mail products may
reduce turnover earned from customers that are unable to recover vat. bpost may become subject
to stricter customs requirements. if enacted, opt-in legislation or any similar legislation, whether
at national or eu level, would contribute to a significant decline in advertising mail volumes. the
enactment of legislation promoting electronic communication, such as granting registered e-mail
the same legal status as registered mail, could also adversely affect bpost’s business.

regulatory changes may also increase bpost’s cost of operation, e.g. legislation promoting energy
efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

risks relating to business operations and company environment

the use of mail has declined in recent years primarily as a result of the increased use of e-mail
and the internet, and is expected to continue to decline. the rate of decline in mail volumes
may also be affected by e-government initiatives or other measures introduced by the belgian
state or other public authorities or private enterprises that encourage electronic substitution in
administrative mail.

adverse economic conditions have a negative impact on mail and parcels volumes. in particular,
during times of economic distress, volumes of advertising mail may be adversely affected as
bpost’s clients reduce their advertising budgets or shift their spending to media other than paper.
volumes of parcels may also be adversely affected due to the effect of economic distress on the
level of business activity and e-commerce.

due to the relatively fixed nature of its cost base, a decline in mail volumes may translate into a
significant decline in profit unless bpost can reduce its costs. accordingly, bpost has introduced
a series of productivity enhancement initiatives to reduce its costs. there can be no assurance,
however, that bpost will realize all of the benefits expected from such initiatives.

bpost bank, the company’s associate, is subject to certain risks as a result of its status as a
financial institution. it may experience losses in respect of its investment portfolio,. it is also
exposed to interest rate risk and volatility in interests rates may affect its business. bpost bank
may also be required to increase its capital, in particular as a result of new capital requirements.

bpost’s strategy involves the development of new products and services to partially compensate
for the effects of declines in mail volumes, and if it is unable to introduce such products and
services, it may encounter difficulties in increasing operating income.

financial risks

exchange rate risk

bpost’s exposure to exchange rate risk is limited. it is monitored, but is not actively managed.

interest rate risk

bpost’s associate bpost bank is, like any bank, subject to the interest rate risk, which directly
influences its margin. interest rates likewise influence valuation of bpost bank’s bond portfolio,
which is measured as an available for sale asset. changes in valuation are reflected as fair value
through other comprehensive income. since bpost bank is an equity-accounted entity, 50% of
the change in its equity directly influences the consolidated equity of bpost. the following table
illustrates the impact of a relative change in interest rates of 1% (from 1% to 1.01% for instance)
on bpost bank equity and, through the equity pick up, on bpost:
  as per 31 december                                                                                  2013

  equity bpost bank                                                                           (2.7)              2.7
  equity bpost                                                                                (1.4)              1.4

bpost is also directly exposed to interest rate risks. the loan granted by the european investment
bank (eib), with an outstanding balance of 81.8 million eur for which the cost amortization is
foreseen in 2022, carries a floating interest rate (3 months euribor rate minus 3.7 basis points).

financial results of bpost are also influenced by the evolution of the discount rates, used to
calculate the employee benefits obligation. at december 31, 2013, an increase by 0.5% of the
average discount rates, would generate a negative financial charges of 15.8 million eur. a decrease
by 0.5% of the average discount rates, would increase financial charges by 18.3 million eur. for
further detail, see note 6.25.

credit risk

bpost is exposed to credit risks through its operational activities, in the investment of its
liquidities and through its investment in bpost bank.

operational activities

the credit risk by definition only concerns that portion of bpost’s activities that are not paid
upfront in cash. bpost actively manages its exposure to credit risk by investigating the solvency
of its customers. this translates into a credit rating and a credit limit. the credit rating is updated
every day for all belgian customers. for foreign customers, the credit rating is updated at each




                                                                                        annual report
                                                                                                  2013         103

contract renewal (and ad hoc in case of change in the customer solvency status). the credit limit
is followed up on a daily basis. if the solvency investigation produces a negative result, bpost
requests the customers to make upfront cash payments, to provide bank guarantees and/or to
grant bpost a direct debit.

trade and other receivables have been reviewed for indicators of impairment. certain trade
receivables were found to be impaired and the movements can be found in the table below.

some of the trade receivables are past due as at the reporting date. the ageing analysis of the
trade receivables that are past due is as follows:

investment of liquidities

regarding the company’s investment of its liquidities, which includes cash and cash equivalents
and investment securities, the exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with
a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

the changes in the fair value of the financial liabilities (see note 6.24) are not due to changes in
credit risk. this is presented in the table hereunder:
  in million eur                                                     2013          2012          2011

bpost bank

bpost bank invests the funds that have been deposited by its customers. the bank has adopted
a strict investment policy that determines an overall allocation of the investments across belgian
state bonds, other sovereign bonds and bonds from financial and commercial corporations. in
addition, maximum concentration limits per issuer, per sector, per rating, per country and per
currency have been established and are constantly monitored.




104

liquidity risk

bpost’s current liquidity risk is limited due to the high level of cash at hand and due to the fact that
a significant portion of its revenues is paid by its customers prior to bpost’s performing the service.

the maturity of the liabilities in the previous reporting period were as follows:
                                             current                       non-current

as at december 31, 2013, liabilities have contractual maturities which are summarized below:

the above contractual maturities are based on the contractual undiscounted payments, which may
differ from the carrying values of the liabilities at the statement of financial position date.

capital management policies and procedures

bpost monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of the carrying amount of equity versus net debt.

the elements composing the equity for this ratio are the same as stated in the equity
reconciliation. net debt is composed of loans less investment securities and cash and cash
equivalents. the ratio is calculated as [net debt / capital].

currently, bpost has not established a formal set of upper and lower limits for this ratio, given
the absence of any significant loans (except the eib loan). the main objectives for the capital
management are to ensure the company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide
an adequate return to shareholders.

6.6       business combinations
in 2013 bpost nv-sa acquired the 20% of mail services inc. that it did not yet own for a price of
9.0 million usd (6.8 million eur), of which 5.3 million usd (4.0 million eur) was paid to the selling
shareholders and 3.7 million usd (2.8 million eur) was paid to the personnel due to a change of
control obligation. this obligation was embedded in the original acquisition agreement and the
settlement of this obligation was triggered when the remaining 20% was acquired. this transaction
led to a deduction of equity by 3.4 million eur as the related financial liability was underestimated
by the same amount.


6.7       segment information
bpost’s business is organized based on business units, service units and corporate units. effective
january 1, 2013, it has operated through two business units: the mrs business unit and the p&i
business unit.

the mail & retail solutions business unit (mrs) offers solutions to big customers, private and
public, self-employed workers and small and medium businesses on one hand and serves the
residential customers as well as all customers using mass market channels such as the post
offices, the post points or the bpost’s eshop to purchase their mail products on the other hand.
it also sells banking and insurance products under an agency agreement with bpost bank and ag
insurance and offers to its clients a number of other payment products.

the parcels & international (p&i) business unit specializes in worldwide mail, parcel and
e-commerce logistics solutions (fulfillment, handling, delivery and return management).

bpost provides products and services based on the following product lines: (i) transactional mail,
(ii) advertising mail, (iii) press, (iv) domestic parcels, (v) international parcels, (vi) special logistics,
(vii) value-added services, (viii) international mail, (ix) banking and financial products and (x) other.
turnover from the transactional mail, advertising mail, press, value-added services product lines

are included within the mrs business unit. turnover from the international mail product line is
included within the p&i business unit. turnover from parcels sold through the retail network,
mainly c2x parcels, is included in the mrs business unit, with the remainder of turnover from
parcels included within the p&i business unit. other turnover is allocated across the mrs and p&i
business units.

bpost has service units that support the business whose costs are recharged to the business and
corporate units using a cost allocation mechanism. the service units include the mso unit, iops
unit, the ict and service operations units and the human resources & organization (hr&o)
unit. the mso service unit is in charge of collecting, sorting and distributing mail and parcels in
belgium. the iops service unit comprises the operations of the european mail center, which is
located at brussels airport and serves as a hub for international mail and parcels.

bpost’s corporate units include finance, legal/regulatory and internal audit and some costs
related to the employee related liabilities and provisions. the costs of the corporate units are not
recharged to other units and are reported under the category “corporate”.

the two business units are also operating segments for financial reporting purposes. operating
income at the level of each of these two segments captures external sales to third parties. the
sum of the operating income of the two segments, together with the operating income of the
reconciling category “corporate”, reconciles to bpost’s operating income. bpost computes its profit
from operating activities (ebit) at the segment.

the operating segments are the lowest level on which performance is assessed by the chief
operating decision maker (codm) under the definition of ifrs 8.22. the codm is the board of
directors.

the table below presents the evolution per business unit and the comparison between the
different product structures for the year ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:
  as per 31 december

revenues attributable to the mrs operating segment decreased by 45.7 million eur in 2013,
mainly driven by the decline in domestic mail volumes (-4.2% excluding the working days and
elections impacts) combined with lower compensation for sgei and decreased revenues in banking
and financial products. this was partially offset by the price and mix improvement in domestic
mail and the net positive impact of the proceeds of certain activities of certipost.

the increase in p&i operating segments revenues in 2013, amounting to 68.8 million eur is mainly
attributable to the consolidation (as from january 1, 2013) of landmark global. the impact of this
scope change amounted to 39.5 million eur. besides this, the solid growth in parcels activities
more than compensated the decline in international mail.

inter-segment sales are immaterial. there is no internal operating income.




                                                                             annual report

excluding the remuneration received to provide the services as described in the management
contract (see note 6.8), no single external customer exceeds 10% of bpost’s total operating
income (revenues).

the following table presents the revenues from external customers attributed to belgium and to
all foreign countries in total from which bpost derives its revenues. the allocation of the revenues
of the external customers is based on their location.

the ebit attributable to the mrs operating segment increased by 120.3 million in 2013. excluding
the negative impact of the provision related to sgei overcompensation (124.9 million eur), the
ebit of the mrs operating segment decreased by 4.6 million as the decline in revenues was almost
offset by cost reductions.

the ebit attributable to the p&i operating segment decreased by 1.9 million eur compared to
2012, to reach 4.7 million eur. the positive impact of the consolidation of landmark global
combined with the positive contribution to the ebit of the volume growth in parcels activities
were compensated by the restructuring provision and the impairment on the goodwill and the
fixed assets related to distribution activities of special logistics (total impact of 11.7 million eur)
and the increased costs for the shop & deliver project (1.9 million eur). without those last two
elements, ebit of the p&i segment would have increased by 11.7 million eur.

profit from operating activities attributable to the corporate reconciliation category improved by
9.3 million eur. in 2012 the reversal of a pending litigation provision of 22.7 million eur recorded
in the past to cover a risk of litigation relating to off-balance sheet transactions conducted prior
to year 2012 had a positive impact on the ebit of the reconciliation category. excluding the
impact of this reversal ebit increased by 32.0 million eur as a result of costs reduction in central
units, the positive impact of the real estate management program and positive evolution in
provisions.

gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment are mainly related to the sales of buildings. the
increase compared to last year is mainly explained by the disposal of one sizeable building.

in october 2012, the company has reached an agreement with the finnish group basware on
the sale of the activity of electronics document exchange as of january 2013. this transaction
generated a cash inflow of 15.1 million eur and a gain of 14.6 million eur in 2013.

the third party costs recovery relates to the sales realized by the company’s restaurants.

other sources of operating income mainly consist of reimbursements by third parties of damages
suffered by bpost and its subsidiaries.

other operating expenses fell by 96.4 million eur as last year figures were impacted by the
provision related to the sgei overcompensation (124.9 million eur), partially offset by a reversal of
a pending litigation for 22.7 million eur. excluding these items, other operating expenses increased
by 5.8 million eur, driven by increased local taxes and other provisions.

in 2012, a provision constituted in previous years to cover the risk of a fine following the
investigation by the competition commission relating to a pricing scheme, was used (which
showed as a negative charge of 37.4 million eur on the line ‘other provisions’) and an identical
charge was recognized on the line ‘penalties’. the net impacts of these movements at the level of
the line ‘other operating expenses’ was equal to zero in 2012.

in 2013, additional provisions were recognized to cover the risks of future costs relating to
contractual penalties with regards to leased vans and to the lease costs for buildings no longer
in use. in addition, a charge of 2.9 million eur was recognized to cover the restructuring costs

relating to the special logistics distribution activity. more details on the evolution of the
provisions can be found in note 6.27.

the decrease in costs related to the change in recoverable vat was totally offset by the higher
accrued charges for local and real estate taxes.

in 2011, the tax effect of the european commission decision represented the tax cost relating
to the non deductible provision of 275 million eur generating 93.4 million eur in tax charges in
2011.

on march 25, 2013, an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of the company approved a reduction
in the legal reserve in the amount of 21.3 million eur through the transfer to available reserves.
due to this transfer, and in accordance with the tax legislation, bpost provisioned an additional
income tax to be paid of 7.3 million eur.

on june 7, 2013, an exceptional dividend of 53.5 million eur was approved by an extraordinary
shareholders’ meeting. the payment of this exceptional dividend, which occurred also on
june 7, 2013, resulted, in accordance with the belgian tax legislation, in the recognition of an
additional tax expense of 10.3 million eur as 30.3 million eur of previously untaxed reserves were
distributed.

as of december 31, 2013, bpost recognized a net deferred income tax asset of 58.3 million eur.
this net deferred income tax asset is composed as follows:

*restated for ias 19r 				



no deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries
and associates, because bpost has control on the reversal of the temporary difference and it is
probable that they will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.


6.14 earnings per share
in accordance with ias 33, the basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net
profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

diluted earnings per share amounts have to be calculated by dividing the net profit attributable
to ordinary equity holders of the parent (after adjusting for the effects of all dilutive potential
ordinary shares) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year
plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the
dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.




                                                                           annual report
                                                                                     2013    113

in case of bpost, no effects of dilution affect the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders
and the weighted average number of ordinary shares. the changes in the weighted average number
of shares for the years 2011,2012 and 2013 is due to a timing difference between the acquisition
of shares by alteris (a 100% bpost subsidiary) from the beneficiaries of the stock option plan
in 2011 and 2012 and the repurchase in december 2012 of those shares by pie (shareholder)
from alteris. as a result of this timing difference, treasury shares were recorded at alteris.
as a consequence, for both 2011 and 2012, the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the year is impacted by the alteris-owned shares for the fraction of the year
they are owned by alteris.

in may 2013, the shareholders’ meeting decided to split the shares. the total number of shares
amounts to 200,000,944 shares post stock split (before stock split it amounted to 409,838 shares).

the table below reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per
share computations, based on the number of shares after the share split:

investment property mainly relates to apartments located in buildings used as post offices.
investment properties are carried at acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and less
any impairment loss. the depreciation amount is allocated on a systematic basis over useful life (in
general 40 years).

the rental income of the investment property amounts to 0.9 million eur (2012: 1.7 million eur).
the estimated fair value of the investment property decreased from 34.8 million eur to 23.3
million eur or by 11.5 million eur driven by a reduction in the number of properties rented out.

in 2013, assets held for sale decreased from 0.3 million eur to 0.1 million eur. the decrease by 0.2
million eur is caused by the deeds signed in 2013 (9.7 million eur) partly counterbalanced by new
sales’ agreements signed in 2013 (9.5 million eur).

the number of buildings recognized in assets held for sale decreased from 3 at the end of 2012
to 2 at the end of 2013. the majority of these assets are retail outlets which are vacant as a
consequence of the optimization of the post offices network.

profits on disposal of 17.8 million eur (2012: 8.5 million eur) were accounted for in the income
statement in the section “other operating income”. in 2013 no impairment charges were recorded
for in the section “depreciation, amortization”.

intangible assets decreased from 95.5 million eur to 89 million eur (by 6.5 million eur), which was
caused by the following reasons:
•  investments in software and licenses (12.3 million eur), development costs capitalized (5.8
   million eur), and other intangible assets (0.3 million eur)
•  amortization & impairments (27.3 million eur), of which an impairment on goodwill of 6.9
   million eur related to special logistics activities
•  transfers from other categories for 2.4 million eur

all amortization and impairment charges are included in the section “depreciation, amortization”
of the income statement.

as a result of the impairment on the goodwill related to special logistics activities, the carrying
amount of the goodwill arising from cash-generating units has decreased from 48.4 million eur to
41.5 million eur. this impairment is the consequence of the decision of the board of eurosprinters
nv on december 24, 2013 to announce its intention to stop its distribution activities and to focus
on its sprinter activities.

an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of an asset or cash
generating units exceeds the recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of net
realizable value and value in use. the amount of the goodwill is fully owned to acquisitions of the
cash-generating units which took mainly place in 2011 and 2012.

the carrying value of these cash-generating units, excluding interest bearing and tax related assets
and liabilities represents, on average, a multiple of 4.7 on operating profit before exceptional items.
the net realizable value of these cash-generating units, for purposes of impairment review (i.e., the ‘fair
value less costs to sell’), has been assessed with reference to earnings multiples for recently acquired
business combinations. on this basis, the net realizable value has been assessed to be in excess of the
carrying value. for none of the remaining cash-generating units, impairment had to be recognized.




                                                                                           annual report
                                                                                                     2013        119

the earnings multiples referenced would need to reduce by about 22% to reduce the net realizable
value below the carrying value of all cash-generating units.

besides the goodwill, there are no other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

decrease of the total future minimum operating lease payments in 2013 compared to 2012 is
mainly related to lower future lease payments related to buildings.

in 2013, rent and rental costs showed an increase of 4.8 million eur, or 7.3% from 65.3 million eur
to 70.0 million eur. this is mainly due to the continuing shift from owned towards leased vehicles
and rent contracts.

the ownership are not transferred to bpost.

in 2013, the service cost includes, for an amount of 8.2 million eur, the service cost related to the
group insurance benefit valued in accordance with ias 19. in 2012, the service cost included the
costs relating to the part-time plan (14.0 million eur).

actuarial gains and losses, caused by changes in discount rates, are recorded as financial costs. in
all other cases, actuarial gains and losses are recorded as operating expenses.

the collective labor agreements negotiated in march 2012 have triggered the elimination
of a number of sick-days for some specific civil servants in exchange for the payment of a
compensation. as a result, the defined benefit obligation decreased and generated an operating
gain of this part settlement of 21.1 million eur in 2012. this income was considered as non-
recurring.

interest costs and financial actuarial gains or losses have been recorded as financial costs. all other
expenses summarized above were included in the income statement caption “payroll costs”.

until 2012, bpost recognized all actuarial gains and losses of post-employment benefits in
accordance with the corridor approach through profit and loss. as from financial year 2010,
bpost adopted a systematic method for faster recognition of actuarial gains and losses for post-
employments benefits by an amortization over two years (or average remaining service period for
the active population, if shorter than two years). the expense amounted to 6.1 million eur in 2012
and to 19 million eur in 2011. all net actuarial gains or losses amortized in the yearly expense
were recognized as operating costs.

ias 19r has been applied as from january 1, 2013. as a result, bpost recognizes all actuarial gains
and losses related to the post-employment benefits directly in “other comprehensive income”
when they occur.

until 2012, bpost has opted, in case of post-employment benefits, not to recognize actuarial gains
and losses that remain within the corridor of 10% of the higher of either the amount of the ias
19 obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. the unrecognized actuarial losses cumulated at
december 31, 2012 related to the post-employment benefits amounted to 14 million eur and
restated in “other comprehensive income”.

the average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of 2013 is 6.9 years
(2012: 6.6 years).

a quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumptions at december 31, 2013 is outlined
here below:
                                                                  discount rate         mortality     medical

  impact on defined benefit obligation (increase)/decrease    15.8           (18.3)       (4.9)          (2.6)

this sensitivity analysis has been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on
defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the
end of the reporting period.

in november 2011, the belgian government has adopted new measures concerning the adaptation
of the legal retirement age and the new conditions of part-time career interruption. the intention
of bpost is to do everything possible to minimize their potential impact. at this moment, it is
not possible to estimate the potential financial impact of the new law and its application on the
defined obligation benefits of bpost.

post-employment benefits

post-employment benefits include family allowances, transport costs, bank costs, funerary costs,
retirement gifts and group insurance.

family allowances

the civil servants of bpost (both active and pensioners) with children at their charge (youths and
disabled) receive a family allowance from office national d’allocations familiales pour travailleurs
salariés (onafts) – rijksdienst voor kinderbijslag voor werknemers (rkw). these costs are then
re-invoiced to bpost.

transportation

inactive civil servants as well as their family members are entitled to personal vouchers that
can be exchanged for a transport ticket for a trip in belgium or for a price reduction on other
transport tickets. when an affiliated worker or retired worker dies, the spouse and children
continue to receive this benefit under some conditions.

in 2012, an amount of 2.2 million eur was recognized in the income statement due to a change in
the population eligible to this benefit.

bank

all active members, pre-pensioners and pensioners that have a “postcheque” account in which their
salary/pension is paid, benefit from a reduction of the fees charged on the current account as well
as favorable interest rates on savings accounts, savings certificates, investment funds and loans.




                                                                                       annual report
                                                                                                 2013        129

group insurance

bpost offers to its active contractual employees a group insurance benefit. since the introduction
of the wap/lpc legislation in belgium these plans have the characteristics of a defined benefit
plan under ias 19. however, until 2013, the legal minimum return for employer contributions was
matched by the guaranteed interest from the insurer.

according to the legislation, the employer, has to guarantee a certain return on the plan assets.
bpost should provide the legal minimum return of 3.25% on employer contributions (after costs
on premiums) and 3.75% on employee contributions. the legal minimum return on employer
contributions is a “career average” return and not a year by year return where the legal minimum
on the employee contributions should be granted on a year by year basis.

due to the change since 2013 in the tariff structure guaranteed by the insurance company, there
is potentially a gap between the legal minimum return and the return guaranteed by the insurance
company.

until now, ias 19 was never clear on how to value such plans and ias 19 rev. 2011 did not
bring any clarification. however, in its meeting on september 10, 2013, ifric progressed on
“the measurement alternative(s) to be considered in developing a proposal on accounting for
contribution-based plans with a guaranteed return”. measurement approaches under consideration
are consistent with the so-called d9 approach. as a result, this plan was included in the ias 19
calculation as at december 31, 2013.

long-term employee benefits

long-term employee benefits include accumulated compensated absences, pension saving days and
part-time benefits.

accumulated compensated absences

civil servants are entitled to 21 sick-days per year. during these 21 days and if they have received
the appropriate note from a doctor, they receive 100% of their salary. if any given year, a civil
servant is absent less than 21 days, the balance of the un-used sickness days is carried over to the
following years up to a maximum of 63 days as from april 2012 instead of 300 days previously.
employees who are ill for more than 21 days during a year will first use up the year’s allotment
and then use the days carried over from previous years as per their individual account. during this
period, they will receive their full salary. once the allotment of the year and the days carried over
are used up, they receive reduced payments.

both the full salary paid under the “sick days” scheme and the reduced payments beyond that are
costs incurred by bpost.

there have been no modifications to the calculation methodology comparatively to 2012. the
valuation is based on the future “projected payments / cash outflows”. the cash outflows are
calculated for the totality of the population considered, based on a certain consumption pattern,
derived from the statistics over the 12 months of 2013. the individual notional accounts are
projected for the future and decreased by the actual number of days of illness.

the annual payment is the number of days used (and limited by the number of days in the savings
account) multiplied by the difference between the projected salary (increased with social charges)
at 100% and the reduced payments. the relevant withdrawal and mortality rates have been applied
together with the discount rate applicable to the duration of the benefit.

the collective labor agreements negotiated in march 2012 has triggered in 2012 the elimination
of a number of sick-days for some specific civil servants in exchange for the payment of a
compensation.

pension saving days

civil servants have the possibility to convert the unused sick days above the 63 days in their
‘notional’ account (see above “accumulated compensated absences “ benefit) in pension saving
days (7 sick days per 1 pension saving day) and to convert each year a maximum of 3 days of
extra-legal holidays. contractual employees with a permanent contract are entitled to a maximum




132

of 2 pension saving days per year and have the possibility to convert each year a maximum of 3
days of extra-legal holidays. the pension saving days are accumulated year over year and can be
used as from the age of 50.

the methodology of valuation is based on the same approach as the benefit “accumulated
compensated absences“. the valuation is based on the future “projected payments / cash
outflows”. these are calculated for the totality of the population considered, based on a certain
“consumption” pattern, derived from the statistics over the 12 months of 2013, as provided by
the human resource department. the individual “pension saving days” accounts are projected per
person and decreased by the actual number of used pension saving days.

the annual payment is the number of pension saving days used multiplied by the projected
daily salary (increased with social charges, holiday pay, end of year premium, management and
integration premium). the relevant withdrawal and mortality rates have been applied together
with the discount rate applicable to the duration of the benefit.

part-time regime (50+)

under the collective labor agreements covering respectively the years, 2009-2010 and 2011,
statutory employees, aged between 50 and 59 , are entitled to enter into a system of partial
(50%) career interruption. bpost makes contributions equal to 7.5% of the gross annual salary for a
period of a maximum of 48 months.

the framework agreement of december 20, 2012 approved a new plan of specific partial (50%)
career interruption accessible to the distributors aged as from 54 years old and to the other
employees aged as from 55 years old. bpost makes contributions equal to 7.5% of the gross annual
salary for a period of a maximum of 72 months for the distributor agents and 48 months for the
other beneficiaries of the plan. the joint committee of december 19, 2013 has agreed to extend
the measure to the non distributor agents until the next collective labor agreement.

bpost’s net liability for employee long-term benefits comprises the following:

termination benefits

early retirement scheme

at the end of 2013, the following previous early-retirement plans are included in this benefit:
• the plan covered by the collective labor agreement for 2011 accessible to the civil servants
  meeting certain age and service organization conditions as at 31/12/2012 at the latest and
• a new plan accessible only in 2011 to the civil servants of one specific department subject to
  age and seniority conditions as described in the joint committee convention of october 6,
  2011.




134

in these early-retirement schemes, bpost continues to pay to the beneficiaries a portion (75%) of
their salary at departure and until they reach retirement age. furthermore, the early-retirement
period is treated as a service period.

the framework agreement of july 1, 2012 approved a new early-retirement plan accessible to the
civil servants meeting certain age, seniority and service organization conditions as at december
31, 2013 at the latest. bpost continues to pay to the beneficiaries a portion (between 60% and
75% depending on the duration of the early-retirement) of their salary at departure and until
they reach retirement age. furthermore, the early-retirement period is treated as a service period.
the joint committee of december 19, 2013 has approved to extend this measure until the next
collective labor agreement.

the employee benefit related to the early retirement schemes arises because of the fact that the
employment is terminated before the normal retirement and the fact that it is the employee’s
decision to accept the offer made by bpost in exchange.

bpost’s net liability for termination benefits comprises the following:

other long-term benefits

workers compensation accident plan

until october 1, 2000, bpost was self-insured for injuries on the workplace and on the way to the
workplace. as a result, all compensations to workers for accidents which occurred before october
1, 2000 are incurred and financed by bpost itself.

since october 1, 2000, bpost has contracted insurance policies to cover the risk.

bpost’s net liability for other long-term employee benefits comprises the following:

the provision for litigation amounts to 39.5 million eur. it represents the expected financial
outflow relating to many different litigations or potential litigations between bpost and third
parties. none of the individual provisions is material in itself.

the period anticipated for the cash outflows pertaining thereto is dependent on developments in
the length of the underlying proceedings for which the timing remains uncertain.

a reversal from the provision for litigation of 8.5 million eur was recorded in 2013 as some payroll-
related issues were definitively resolved.

the reversal in 2012 amounts to 33.2 million eur and is mainly due to a reversal of a pending
litigation provision for 22.7 million eur recorded in the past to cover a risk of litigation relating
to off-balance sheet transactions conducted prior to 2010. as the matter was definitively resolved




                                                                                        annual report
                                                                                                  2013    139

in the course of 2012, the provision was no longer necessary and was reversed. this reversal
is considered to be a non-recurring item. non-recurring items represent significant income or
expense items that due to their non-recurring character are excluded from internal reporting and
performance analyses. a non-recurring item is deemed to be significant if it amounts to eur 20
million or more. reversals of provisions, whose addition had been considered as non-recurring, are
also considered as non-recurring.

reversal from the provision for litigation of 9.6 million eur was recorded in 2011 as some payroll-
related risks were definitively resolved. the reversals were considered as non recurring as the
addition to the provision had also been reported as non-recurring.

the amount of the provision for sgei related litigation is mainly explained by the decision of the
european commission. an amount of 299 million eur was provisioned in 2011. this provision was
used in 2012 as the recovery amount was paid to the belgian state. a second provision of 124.9
million eur was created in 2012, for the risk related to a possible over-compensation of the 2011
and 2012 periods. on may 2, 2013, the european commission approved the compensation granted
to the company under the terms of the 5th management contract covering the period from 2013
to 2015. the european commission’s decision was not appealed which settled this litigation in
2013. all amounts are considered as non-recurring.

the provision related to environment issues covers among others soil sanitation. the reduction
in 2012 is explained by the sale of two specific sites while in 2013 an additional provision of 0.2
million eur was recorded relating to one specific site.

the provision on onerous contracts concerns the best estimate of the costs relating to the closing
down of mail and retail offices and the restructuring of the special logistics distribution activities.
the majority of these settlements are expected within the next 5 years. the additional provisions
which were recognized in 2013 are related to the vision 2020 project and the restructuring within
special logistics.

other provisions amount to 10.3 million eur. the increase in 2013 is mainly due to a provision
which was recognized to cover the end of contract damage related costs for vehicles.

bpost is currently involved in the following legal proceedings initiated by intermediaries:
• a claim for damages in an alleged (provisional) amount of approximately 19.9 million eur
  (exclusive of late payment interest) in the context of legal proceedings initiated by publimail nv-
  sa and pending before the brussels commercial court.
• a claim for damages in an alleged (provisional) amount of approximately 28 million eur
  (exclusive of late payment interest) in the context of legal proceedings initiated by link2biz
  international nv and pending before the brussels commercial court. certain aspects of the
  contractual relationship between link2biz and bpost are also the subject of a cease and desist
  order (adopted on june 21, 2010), which bpost has appealed in august 2010 and which is
  currently pending before the brussels court of appeal.

all claims and allegations are contested by bpost.

moreover, on july 20, 2011 the belgian postal regulator (“bipt/ibpt”) concluded that certain
aspects of the company’s 2010 pricing policy infringed the belgian postal act and imposed a fine
of 2.3 million eur. while bpost paid the fine in 2012, it contests the bipt/ibpt’s findings and
appealed the decision. the appeal is pending before the brussels court of appeal.

finally, on december 10, 2012, the belgian competition authority concluded that certain aspects
of the company’s pricing policy over the january 2010-july 2011 period infringed belgian and
european competition law and imposed a fine of approximately 37.4 million eur. while bpost
paid the fine in 2013, it contests the belgian competition authority’s findings and appealed the
decision. the appeal is currently pending before the brussels court of appeal.


6.28 contingent liabilities and contingent assets
as of december 31, 2013, bpost had 4,911 auxiliary postmen. in 2013, 45 auxiliary postmen
initiated a lawsuit against the company in the brussels and charleroi labor courts claiming equal
salary and benefits by reference to baremic contractual employees performing the same work,
mainly under the non-discrimination provisions set forth in articles 10 and 11 of the belgian
constitution. all claims and allegations are contested by bpost.

however, if the courts were to find that this principle is applicable and bpost is found to have
violated it, the labor courts will most likely order bpost to increase the compensation of the
auxiliary postmen to the level of relevant baremic contractual employees and it cannot be
excluded that other employees could bring similar claims.


6.29 rights and commitments
guarantees received

at december 31, 2013, bpost benefits from bank guarantees in a sum of 39.6 million eur, issued
by banks on behalf of bpost’s customers (2012: 39.8 million eur). these guarantees can be called in
and paid against in the event of non-payment or bankruptcy. they therefore offer bpost financial
certainty during the period of contractual relations with the customer.

goods for resale on consignment

at december 31, 2013, merchandise representing a sales value of 0.5 million eur had been
consigned by partners for the purpose of sale through the postal network.

guarantees given

bpost acts as guarantor (1.5 million eur guarantee) in the framework of the domymove
collaboration agreement between bpost, belgacom and electrabel.

bpost has an agreement with belfius, ing and kbc, according to which they agree to provide for
up to 43.6 million eur in guarantees for bpost upon simple request.

funds of the state

bpost settles and liquidates the financial transactions of government institutions (taxes, vat, etc.)
on behalf of the state. the funds of the state constitute transactions “on behalf of” and are not
included in the statement of financial position.

relations with the shareholders

the belgian state as a shareholder

the belgian state, directly and through the sfpi/fpim, is the majority shareholder of the company
and holds 50% + 488 shares of the company. accordingly, it has the power to control any decision
at the shareholders’ meeting requiring a simple majority vote.

regarding the rights of the belgian state as shareholder of the company reference is made to the
corporate governance section.

the belgian state as public authority

the belgian state is, together with the european union, the main legislator in the postal sector.
the ibpt/bipt, the national regulatory authority, is the main regulator of the postal sector in
belgium.

the belgian state as a customer

the belgian state is one of the company’s largest customers. in 2013, 17% of bpost’s total
operating income (revenues) was attributable to the belgian state. bpost provides postal delivery
services to a number of ministries, both on commercial terms and pursuant to the provisions of
the 5th management contract.

the company provides universal postal services and sgeis entrusted to it by the belgian state,
covering postal, financial, and other public services. the law of march 21, 1991 and the 5th
management contract set out the rules and conditions for carrying out the obligations that the
company assumes in execution of its universal postal services and services of general economic
interest, and, where applicable, the financial compensation paid by the belgian state.

the sgeis entrusted to the company under the 5th management contract include the
maintenance of the retail network, the provision of day-to-day sgeis (i.e., early delivery of
newspapers, distribution of periodicals, “cash at counter” services and home delivery of pensions
and social allowances) and the provision of certain ad hoc sgeis, which are sgeis that by their
nature are provided without any recurrence. ad hoc sgeis include the social role of the postman,
especially in relation to persons who live alone or are the least privileged (this service is rendered
through the use of handheld terminals and the electronic id card by mail carriers on their round),
the “please postman” service, the distribution of information to the public, cooperation with
regard to the delivery of voting paper packages, the delivery of addressed and unaddressed
election printed items, the delivery at a special price of postal items sent by associations, the
delivery of letter post items falling within the freepost system, the payment of attendance fees
during elections, the financial and administrative processing of fines, the printing and sale of
fishing permits and the sale of post stamps.




142

the sgeis entrusted to the company under the 5th management contract are aimed at satisfying
certain objectives related to the public interest. in order to ensure territorial and social cohesion,
the company must maintain a retail network consisting of at least 1,300 postal service points and
650 post offices.

tariffs and other terms for the provision of certain of the services are determined in implementing
agreements between the company, the belgian state and, where relevant, the other parties or
institutions concerned. some of such implementing agreements must still be concluded. however,
the implementing agreements concluded according to the 4th management contract remain in
place until conclusion of these new implementing agreements.

certain limited public services are provided by the company only pursuant to the law of march
21, 1991 (e.g., delivery of stamps by postmen during their rounds) and the company also provides
cash account management services to the belgian state and certain other public entities pursuant
to the royal decree of january 12, 1970 regulating the postal service as amended pursuant to the
royal decree of april 30, 2007 regulating postal financial services and the royal decree of april 14,
2013 amending the royal decree of january 12, 1970 regulating the postal service.

december 31, 2013. all accounts include basic services such as debit cards, access to payment and
money transfer services and cash withdrawals at post office tellers or atms. bpost also offers the
mastercard bpost bank credit card.

bpost bank’s customer lending activity is limited to granting overdraft facilities to customers and
some consumer credits. however, these products account for a relatively small portion of bpost
bank’s assets and profit. as of december 31, 2013, bpost bank had approximately 86.5 million eur
in loans on its balance sheet.

as an insurance intermediary, bpost bank also offers annuity and pension products, including
“branche 21” and “branche 23” life insurance policies, which provide some level of protection for
the assets of the policy holder.




                                                                             annual report
                                                                                       2013      143

bpost bank does not perform any asset management activities nor any private banking or
commercial lending.

banking partnership agreement

the cooperation between bpost bank and bnp paribas fortis with respect to bpost bank is set out
in a banking partnership agreement which has recently been renegotiated and signed on december
13, 2013 for a term of 7 years as of january 1, 2015.

the new framework agreement provides in substance that (i) the company and bnp paribas
fortis will continue to cooperate through bpost bank, which will continue to be an associate
of the company; (ii) the company will remain, subject to certain exceptions provided for in the
partnership agreement, the exclusive distributor of bpost bank’s products and services through its
network of post offices; and (iii) the company will continue to provide back office activities and
other ancillary services to bpost bank.

working capital

bpost bank has placed 9.0 million eur at the disposal of bpost without guarantee or payment
of interest by bpost. this sum will remain available to bpost throughout the term of the banking
partnership agreement. it is intended to constitute the working capital enabling bpost to conduct
business on behalf of bpost bank.

insurance partnership agreement

an insurance distribution agreement has been concluded between bpost, bpost bank, ag insurance
(formerly fortis insurance), agallis and fortis banque. this agreement has been amended in 2010,
with effect as of january 1, 2010 to reflect the corporate reorganization of the fortis group (ag
insurance being now independent from fortis bank), a new commission scheme and a renewal of
the exclusivity clause.

the parties concerned have agreed to offer and market insurance products of ag insurance via
bpost bank using the distribution network of bpost. in effect, up to and including the accounting
year 2014, the contract provides for an access fee, commission on all the insurance products sold
by bpost and additional commissions if the sales figures laid down are achieved.

the company entered into negotiations in 2013 with respect to the renewal of the existing
insurance partnership agreement which will expire on december 31, 2014.

report of the joint auditors
to the general meeting of shareholders of bpost sa de droit public / bpost nv
van publiek recht on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31
december 2013



in accordance with the legal requirements, we report to you on the performance of our mandate of joint
auditors. this report contains our opinion on the consolidated financial statements (the “consolidated
financial statements”) as well as our report on other legal and regulatory requirements as further defined
below. the consolidated financial statements include the consolidated statement of financial position as of
31 december 2013, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of other comprehensive
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended 31 december 2013 and the notes.

report on the consolidated financial statements -
unqualified opinion
we have audited the consolidated financial statements of bpost sa de droit public / bpost nv van publiek
recht (“the company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “the group”) as of and for the year
ended 31 december 2013. these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
international financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union. the total of the consolidated
statement of financial position amounts to € 1.929,2 million and the consolidated income statement shows a
profit for the year, attributable to the group, of € 285,4 million.

responsibility of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements

the board of directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a
true and fair view in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the european
union. the board of directors is also responsible for the implementation of internal controls, which it
considers necessary for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

responsibility of the joint auditors

our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (“isa”). those standards
require that we comply with the ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. the procedures selected depend on the joint auditors’ judgment, including
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the joint auditors consider internal control relevant to
the group’s preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion




                                                                                  annual report
                                                                                            2013       149

on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the board of directors, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

we have obtained from management and the company’s officials the explanations and information necessary
to perform our audit and we believe that the resulting audit evidence that we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

unqualified opinion

in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the company give a true and fair view of the
group’s consolidated financial position as of 31 december 2013 and of its consolidated financial performance
and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the international financial
reporting standards as adopted by the european union.

report on other legal and regulatory requirements
the board of directors is responsible for the preparation and the content of the report of the board of
directors on the consolidated financial statements, including the corporate governance statement, in
accordance with articles 96 and 119 of the company code (wetboek van vennootschappen / code des
sociétés) as well as the compliance of these consolidated financial statements with the company code.

as part of our assignment and in accordance with the applicable supplementary standard issued by the
belgian institute of registered auditors (instituut van de bedrijfsrevisoren/institut des réviseurs d’entreprises)
as published in the belgian state gazette on 28th august 2013 (the “supplementary standard”), it is our
responsibility to perform certain procedures, in all material respects, on the compliance of certain legal and
regulatory requirements, as defined in the supplementary standard. as a result of these procedures, we
provide the following additional statement which does not modify our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements:
•  the report of the board of directors on the consolidated financial statements includes the information
   required by law, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and does not present any
   material inconsistencies with the information that we became aware of during the performance of our
   mandate.
