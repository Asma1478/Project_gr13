 to bring about "a prosperous community, constantly growing in affluence"
 establishment of "dream agricultural research institute (yumesoken)"

bringing agriculture to the next stage
iseki group has so far made various proposals including low-cost cultivation such as sparse planting technology to
bring about agriculture that inspires hopes for the future.
on the other hand, the agriculture in japan is undergoing major changes such as introduction of large-scale farming,
entry of companies into farm business, conversion staple rice into other crops for full utilization of rice paddies, etc.
iseki, which will be more and more required to make proposals to cope with these changes in the future, established
the "dream agricultural research institute (yumesoken)" that will research, demonstrate, and promote advanced farm
business technologies.
