          materiality

eisai’s corporate philosophy is to give first thought to patients and their families, and increase the benefits that health care provides
them. likewise, eisai provides employees, who are the bearer of the patient contribution, with opportunities to develop careers and
talent. eisai’s mission is to increase the benefit for the patients, then revenue and profit are brought about consequently. we put
emphasis on this order of mission and the results.
   on the other hand, in order to sustain corporate value maximization to fulfil every stakeholder’s satisfaction, with the corporate
philosophy’s concept of “mission and the results” in consideration, it is regarded to be efficient to focus on the long-term investor,
a beneficiary of residual income, as the important stakeholder＊1. long-term interests of all stakeholders including patients and
employees taken into account, it is believed that identifying the concerns which relate to the interests of long-term investor and
then taking initiatives on a priority basis, is the fast track for the maximization of corporate value.
   process for establishing materiality and eisai’s materiality matrix are shown below. reviews and updates are undertaken as
needed.

the driving force of eisai

“human health care (hhc)”
• established the corporate philosophy in 1992, which is understood and internalized as our core
   value by each employee within the group, both in japan and overseas
• encourages all employees to use 1% of their total business hours to interact with patients
• incorporated the corporate philosophy into the company’s articles of incorporation in june 2005
• carry out more than 300 hhc activities globally every year

based on a clear understanding that patients as well as their families and customers are the key players in health care, eisai seeks
to have a sense of pride in providing benefits to such stakeholders. this corporate philosophy is summarized by the term “human
health care (hhc).” we believe that in order to truly consider the perspectives of patients and their families, it is important for each
employee to first get close to patients and see the situation from their perspectives in order to learn to empathize with thoughts
and feelings that might not necessarily always be expressed in words. accordingly, we recommend that all of its employees
spend 1% of their business hours with patients.
   to commemorate our values and goals, we incorporated the corporate philosophy into the company’s articles of
incorporation, upon receiving approval at the annual general shareholders' meeting in june 2005.

 corporate philosophy
 we give first thought to patients and their families, and increase the benefits that health care provides them
 articles of incorporation
 article 2. (1) the company’s corporate philosophy is to give first thought to patients and their families, and increase the benefits that health

 (2) the company’s mission is the enhancement of patient satisfaction. the company believes that revenues and earnings will be generated by
      fulfilling this mission. the company places importance on this sequence of placing the mission before the ensuing results.
 (3) the company strives to fulfill its social responsibilities by positioning compliance (i.e., the observance of legal and ethical standards) as the
      basis of all business activities.
 (4) the company’s principal stakeholders are patients, customers, shareholders and employees. the company endeavors to develop and
      maintain a good relationship with stakeholders and to enhance the value of their stake through:
      1. satisfying unmet medical needs, ensuring a stable supply of high-quality products, and providing useful information on subjects including
          drug safety and efficacy;
      2. timely disclosure of corporate management information, enhancement of corporate value, and a positive return to shareholders; and
      3. ensuring stable employment, offering challenging and fulfilling duties, and providing full opportunities for the development of employees’
          capabilities.

    living the hhc philosophy in everyday work

eisai plans and promotes various activities in order to have each employee recognize eisai’s corporate philosophy as a
shared value and to express that philosophy in each employee’s daily work duties.


providing opportunities to share experiences with patients
eisai provides employees with a variety of opportunities to spend time with
patients with diseases such as dementia, cancer and epilepsy, as part of
its business operations.
   one such opportunity is through the field experience training program,
where employees visit hospitals and nursing care facilities to gain first-hand
knowledge about medical and nursing care practices. for new employees,
we host workshops in collaboration with an advocacy group to discuss
ideas for solving various issues that patients and persons with disabilities
face in society.


sharing knowledge through the hhc initiative
eisai promotes specific action plans called hhc activities that aim to realize
hhc at an organizational level or on a project basis. every year, eisai holds
the annual hhc initiative to acknowledge outstanding activities that have
made significant contributions to patients from among the more than 300
hhc activities carried out globally. award winners and top management
from eisai group companies around the world gather together at this event
to present their best practices. by sharing collective knowledge, we strive to further contribute to patients.

eisai’s hhc is different from corporate social responsibility (csr), which mainly involves social contribution activities
including acts of charity that do not directly contribute to business or corporate value. it is relatively close to creating
shared value (csv), a business model that aims to pursue both social value and economic value. eisai’s mission is to
create social value by enhancing patient satisfaction, and economic value in the form of revenue and profit is generated
as a result. eisai places importance on this sequence of placing the mission before the ensuring results.

        eisai’s value creation process and flow

eisai seeks to increase corporate value by putting its corporate philosophy into practice. accordingly,
eisai considers it a top priority to work to build relationships of trust with a wide range of stakeholders
including customers, shareholders and local communities; maximize value for patients, shareholders and
employees; and strive to be a socially responsible company.

value generated through corporate activities is built up as “capital”, which is increased, decreased and converted through the
business model. in this report, based on the framework＊1 released by the international integrated reporting council (iirc), the
process of investing capital to engage in business and create added value wherein the increase in capital exceeds the inputs is
considered to be the “value creation process.”
  meanwhile, “value creation flow”, or how value is generated through business activities, is ultimately an assessment focused
on the financial perspective based on the balanced scorecard’s＊2 four perspectives＊3, 4. this is also consistent with the thinking
(sequence of goals and outcomes) that is based on eisai’s corporate philosophy of creating social value by enhancing patient
satisfaction, our sole objective, and thereby generating economic value in the form of sales and profit.
  this report expresses eisai’s continuous value generation as a value creation process and flow model based on a new model
that incorporates the iirc framework and balanced scorecard.

pharmaceutical company which has conducted development of medicines over the course of many years, a
decade is certainly not a long period of time. eisai will endeavor to make steady contributions to patients with

  ‘eway 2025’ aims to achieve the following three strategic intents:

  1. aim to support patients’ thought: “i do not want to get sick. i want to know if i get sick, and i want
     to be cured.”
  2. aim to support patients’ thought: “i want to control my disease in my neighborhood and safely
      spend the rest of my life with peace of mind.”

   ■eisai endeavors to provide meaningful work for innovation and development opportunities
   ■foster corporate culture without discrimination or harassment, which embraces diversity & inclusion, and encourage challenge
    and “trial and error” for success
   ■attract and acquire great talent who feel for hhc to maximize the satisfaction of patients

our important goals. we are deepening discussion on
our work style reforms by exchanging opinions with our
labor union. in particular, our efforts to improve long

and our employees’ overtime hours are decreasing. to
continue these improvements, our actions are based on
encouraging time management as we take measures
such as strengthening individual monitoring for those who
work long hours, encouraging our employees to take
leaves and considering the introduction of a system for
taking record of arriving and leaving times to work place.              fy2012            fy2013             fy2014             fy2015            fy2016

overview of “socialization with patients” program in japan in which members of public
relations (pr) and investor relations (ir) departments participated

eight members of visited jasmin ogi (adachi-ku, tokyo), a residential complex for the elderly with small-scale and multifunctional
home care and services, and implemented “socialization”. the facility offers support and functional training for daily life in a homelike
environment as well as interactions with local people so that its users can remain as independent as possible. each member who
participated in the program spent time with dementia patients and learned about their feelings.


understanding of the reality of patients by pr and ir department members

we learned that dementia patients have very strong motivation of
dementia patients to communicate with others. even though we met
for the first time, the patients shared many stories with us about their
experiences in their youth, families, health and more.
   they also seemed to be very worried and conflicted at times. some
of them forgot what they had said only a few minutes earlier. they had
difficulty finding the appropriate words and looked confused. on such
occasions, we talked to them and nodded with a smile. this helped them
feel relieved and continue with their stories. deep inside, the patients wish
to stay connected to the society and to be needed and recognized by
others. this is a common feeling that we all have.
   some patients apparently tried to conceal their memory problem,
but by fully accepting them as they are, we saw many smiles on their
faces. they are afraid of becoming more incapable of doing what they
had once taken for granted, such as finding appropriate words while speaking. at the same time, they want to stay as they really are.
                                                                  being exposed to these feelings, we sensed the personality of dementia

what are global investors asking of japanese companies? —“medium-to-long-term capital efficiency
(roe)” and “relevance between non-financial capital and value creation” —

the japanese version of the stewardship code (february 2014) and the corporate governance code (june 2015) were
formulated as principles setting forth the responsibilities of institutional investors and corporations from the perspective
of the medium-to-long-term growth of the japanese economy. the ito review (august 2014) was also released by the
ministry of economy, trade and industry (meti) with the aim of seeking continuous value creation and it recommends
that companies strive to “improve medium-to-long-term roe” as a core target of company management and promote
“dialogue between companies and investors” that contributes to sustainable corporate value creation. as a result of
these suggestions, numerous companies are now undertaking initiatives for improving roe while “purposeful dialogue”
between companies and investors is being promoted.
  on this note, what then are global long-term investors asking of japanese companies? here we introduce the results
of one survey.

 ＊source based on the following reference: “how do global investors look at japanese companies?”, corporate accounting, chuokeizai-sha, may 2017 issue


the results of this survey clearly show that long-term investors are basically asking japanese companies to generate
roe of 8% level over the medium-to-long-term and to demonstrate the value relevance between non-
financial capital and capital efficiency (roe). this suggests that companies must make continuous efforts toward
sustainable corporate value creation.


eisai’s roe management —target a positive equity spread over the medium-to-long-term—

eisai has been working to improve its medium-to-long-term roe since the beginning of the 2000s. as a specific target,
eisai aims to avoid short-termism and achieve roe above cost of equity over the medium-to-long-term (e.g.,
10-year average). in other words, eisai aims to create a “positive equity spread (roe – cost of equity).” cost of equity
is the return demanded by shareholders and eisai has conservatively assumed a cost of shareholders’ equity of 8%. eisai
is generating a historical 10-year average roe of 10.7% and a positive equity spread of 2.7%.

in the cfo policy, i have placed medium-to-long-term roe management on the center line of corporate value creation.
   under the dupont method, roe can be analyzed by three elements consisting of margin (ratio of profit to revenue),
turnover (total asset turnover ratio) and financial leverage. eisai is focusing on optimizing each of these three elements.
   to increase margins, eisai will focus on expanding high-profit global brands discovered and developed in-house, such
as lenvima, halaven and fycompa. eisai will also strive to improve margin by emphasizing selection and concentration for
priority projects and utilizing partnerships.
   to improve turnover, eisai will manage the cash conversion cycle (ccc) to control working capital and strive to improve
asset efficiency through steps, including selling assets encompassing investment securities and streamlining inventory.
   in using financial leverage, eisai will pursue an optimal capital structure while maintaining financial integrity.
   for maintaining a single a level credit rating, we have set the kpis of net der of 0-0.3, a ratio of equity attributable
to owners of the parent of 50%-60% and net debt/ebitda of 0-3 years. by undertaking business activities based
on financial discipline, we are steadily reducing interest-bearing debt, and we secured net cash as of the end of fiscal 2016
for the first time in approximately nine years. net der was negative 0.05, the ratio of equity attributable to owners of the
parent was 57% and net debt/ebitda was negative 0.31 years. based on the view that we have secured sufficient financial
integrity, we believe we can resume our leverage strategies. at the end of fiscal 2016, we possessed investment securities in
the amount of ¥36.3 billion and broader-based net cash, which includes investment securities, stood at ¥63.6 billion and net
der was negative 0.11.
   through the above initiatives, we will pursue sustainable roe on a medium-to-long-term (10-year average) basis rather
than focus on short-termism.
   this cfo policy of roe management is based on the corporate philosophy (hhc) and enlightened value maximization
theory (michael c. jansen, 2001).



● vcic (value-creative investment criteria)
investments will become even more important for companies to achieve growth. for this reason, eisai has determined value-
creative investment criteria (vcic) to ensure its strategic investments create shareholder value. when making investments,
we use net present value (npv) and the internal rate of return (irr) spread using a risk-adjusted hurdle rate as kpis. in
principle, we naturally select only those investments with a positive npv and set a certain spread for irr to assure value
creation. in setting hurdle rates, we factor in all risk elements, such as the particular investment project, the investee country
and liquidity. we have approximately 200 types of hurdle rates and apply the risk-adjusted hurdle rate appropriate for each
respective investment project.



               formula of risk-adjusted hurdle rate
               risk-adjusted hurdle rate = risk free rate + β × risk premium (+ liquidity premium)
                  - risk free rate: 10 year average yield of 10 year government bond
                  - β: defined by investment categories (risk profile)




● dividend policy
eisai returns profits to all shareholders in a stable and sustainable manner based on factors such as a healthy
balance sheet and comprehensive consideration of consolidated financial results, dividend on equity (doe, ratio of equity
attributable to owners of the parent) and free cash flow, as well as consideration of the signaling effect. we strive for an “optimal
dividend policy based on an optimal capital structure” that depends on long-term balance sheet management, rather than
a dividend payout ratio based on short-term performance. as a kpi for dividends, from the perspective of balance sheet
management, eisai has adopted doe, which indicates the ratio of dividends to consolidated net assets.


                                                                28

in principle, eisai strives to maintain dividends within the range of free cash flow at a multi-year level. as kpis for maintaining
a healthy balance sheet, eisai has set the targets of net der of 0-0.3, equity attributable to owners of the parent of 50%-
60% and net debt/ebitda of 0-3 years. based on these policies, eisai is maintaining a healthy balance sheet under present
conditions and therefore plans to maintain dividends of 150 yen＊1 per share in fiscal 2017, which is an expectation of
numerous shareholders＊2, with an intention of protecting shareholder value. acquisition of treasury stock will be carried out
appropriately after factors such as the market environment and capital efficiency (roe) are taken into account.

● eisai’s funding policy
eisai’s funding policy is based on the pecking order theory. it defines the priority order of funding as follows; “cash on hand”
comes first, then the second is “funding by debt” and “funding by new equity” is the last option. as an efficient funding
measure, eisai adopts a global cash management system (gcms) for the effective cash utilization among group companies.
therefore, we consider cash on hand and debt come out on top and equity financing, which could damage existing
shareholder value, is the last option.

striving for sustainable corporate value creation by enhancing non-financial capital

according to the multi-capital model of the international integrated reporting council (iirc) framework (iirc, 2013),
corporate value is composed of six capitals that are broadly divided into two categories, namely non-financial capital
(intellectual capital, human capital, manufactured capital, social and relationship capital and natural capital)
and financial capital. to create sustainable corporate value, besides its financial capital, eisai also works to enhance
non-financial capital.
   how is non-financial capital linked to corporate value? here, let us examine the relevance between pbr (price book-
value ratio), a proxy variable for shareholder value, and non-financial capital.

eisai’s pbr has generally been above 2 during the past 10 years and recently has been maintained at slightly
above or below 3. this means that the assessment of eisai’s market value has significantly exceeded its net
assets (book value on accounting basis).
  based on the assumption that shareholder value equals long-term total market capitalization and also equals book
value of shareholders’ equity (bv) plus mva, eisai’s present financial capital is equivalent to bv while its non-financial
capital consisting of intellectual capital, human capital, manufactured capital, social and relationship capital, and natural
capital is related to mva (the portion that exceeds pbr of 1). these are also called “future financial capital.” non-financial
capital, which becomes mva, is sort of a “self-created goodwill” that cannot be recorded by accounting and can also
be considered as “intangibles (invisible value)” that should be created by the effort of the management. this is called
the iirc-pbr model.
  from the perspective of the latest pbr, eisai’s “self-created goodwill” is earning high acclaim centering on esg.
nonetheless, we recognize that we must further enhance this value, with efforts focused on the r&d pipeline.

value relevance between non-financial capital and equity spread

as cfo, i proposed a synchronized model regarding financial capital and non-financial capital value relevance based
on our corporate philosophy (hhc) prior to the announcement of the iirc (international integrated reporting council)
framework in consideration of medium-to-long-term capital efficiency (roe and equity spread) and sustainability
(importance of non-financial capital).

first, under the ①intrinsic value model, market value added (mva) is defined as esg/csr＊1 value (cost of capital
reduction effects), customer value, human value, and organizational value.
   in contrast to this, the aforementioned ②iirc-pbr model explains the relevance of six capitals under the iirc
framework, by positioning book value of shareholders’ equity (bv) as financial capital, and relating mva to non-financial
capital consisting of intellectual capital, human capital, manufactured capital, social and relationship capital and natural
capital, based on the assumption that shareholder value equals long-term total market capitalization and also equals
book value of shareholders’ equity (bv) plus mva.
   from the ③residual income model (rim), it is thought that mva converges in the total present value of equity spread.
therefore, it can be considered that future financial value creation based on equity spread over the long term does not
conflict with non-financial capital value such as esg and mva creation and is not mutually contradictory and can be
synchronized.
   in conjunction with the non-financial capital and equity spread value relevance model, the intrinsic value model
which relates non-financial capital to mva, the iirc-pbr model and the residual income model (rim) which implicates
the relation between mva and equity spread, are mutually complementary through the creation of mva. also, there are
many publicized academic research papers that prove the positive correlation between pbr and roe and the non-
financial capital that substantiates this model.

enhancing non-financial capital leads to corporate value creation through an improvement in roc (return on capital)

eisai inputs the six capitals that include non-financial capital and aims to create two outputs, namely the provision of
solutions and development of new drugs mainly in the neurology area and oncology area.
  in undertaking our business based on the corporate philosophy (hhc), we have strengthened initiatives toward esg,
which is non-financial value. additionally, we strive to create outcomes such as “fulfilling patient needs for prevention,
cure and care” as well as to make “contributions to local communities by providing security and safety.” we believe these
outcomes will lead to the elimination of gaps that hinder the enjoyment of high-quality medical treatment and care and
also contribute to the attainment of the sustainable development goals (sdgs) advocated by the united nations.
  enhancing non-financial capital that depends on the corporate philosophy (hhc) will lead to high-level output and the
realization of outcomes and will ultimately result in an improvement in financial and non-financial roc. furthermore,
as cfo, i believe that these activities will lead to an improvement of roe as financial capital by a deferred
effect over the long-term, which will eventually converge with an improvement of pbr, a proxy indicator for
shareholder value, and lead to the creation of sustainable corporate value.

promoting engagement that emphasizes our “premium” (total of approximately 700 dialogues per year)

as cfo, i believe that promoting an understanding of our non-financial information is essential for realizing the objectives
of our engagement, which is to have our corporate value assessed from the perspective of medium-to-long-term
corporate value creation. this non-financial information covers areas such as intellectual capital centering on our pipeline
and patents; human capital that handles our operations; our initiatives for improving access to medicines; and our
corporate governance. to attain this objective, eisai’s ir team holds a total of approximately 700 dialogues with investors
and analysts on an annual basis. among these, cfo holds approximately 200 interviews, including with overseas
investors every year. the cfo and ir team strive to reduce cost of equity and are committed to promoting engagement
based on the idea of “ir is not a cost center and contributes to corporate value creation.” regarding this point, in a
report issued by smbc nikko securities inc. senior analyst, yasuhiro nakazawa, on june 19, 2014, eisai’s per was
noted as being more than 10% above the industry average. the report referred to this as an ir premium and attributed it
to investors’ high regard of eisai’s clear capital policy and adept ir activities.
  in promoting engagement, we will hold discussions on sophisticated financial theories and capital policies such as
cost of equity and optimal capital structure. likewise, at the engagement, in addition to pipeline as non-financial capital,
we will actively emphasize the discussion point of value correlation between esg and capital productivity. as cfo, i will
pursue further synchronization model of non-financial capital and corporate value supported by experimental research
and aim for sustainable long-term shareholder value creation by repeatedly promoting engagement based on our
corporate philosophy (hhc).

    6 “ricchi” and ongoing projects in neurology area
    a diverse range of ongoing projects in the area of dementia




 ricchi 1    early and minimally-invasive diagnostics
pet (positron emission tomography) imaging and measurements using cerebrospinal fluid are utilized to detect the
accumulation of beta amyloid (aβ) for early diagnosis of dementia. as major challenges, the number of facilities with pet
imaging available is limited, and cerebrospinal fluid must be drawn by inserting a needle into the spinal cord cavity of the
hip, which places a large burden on patients. eisai is therefore undertaking various projects for developing methods for
early detection of dementia, such as by using blood biomarkers, that reduce the burden on patients.


 main ongoing project
 collaboration with sysmex corporation (blood diagnosis)
 we are utilizing sysmex corporation’s super-resolution fluorescence microscope and attempting to identify brain-
 derived soluble aβ aggregates in the blood. currently, eisai’s accumulated clinical trial samples are being used to
 examine the possibility of utilizing the measurement of uniquely structured aβ aggregates for diagnosing dementia.
 in this way, we are aiming to develop an early diagnostic method of dementia that does not place a burden on the
 patient.

 ricchi 4     neuro-inflammation and immuno-genetics
glial cells in the brain and spinal cord play an important role in maintaining                    ■neuron interference by reactive glial cells
homeostasis by regulating immune functions and replenishing nutrients in the
central nervous system. when activated in pathological conditions, they move to
the disease site and attempt to devour damaged cells and extracellular proteins
such as aβ. however, if they maintain this activated state for a long period of
time, they become reactive glial cells that release excessive inflammatory factors
which are thought to interfere with neurons. this process is thought to be one of
the causes of neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer’s disease. in fact,
genome-wide association study (gwas) on alzheimer’s disease has revealed
genetic risks reported to have mechanisms associated with neuro-inflammation.
eisai is focusing on projects related to reactive glial cells for the creation of
treatment in dementia area.


 main ongoing project
 •anti-fractalkine antibody e6011
 anti-fractalkine antibody e6011 is currently being developed for rheumatoid arthritis and
 inflammatory bowel disease, and expanding its indications to include alzheimer’s disease is
 under consideration. e6011 binds with fractalkine, a chemokine that is induced on vascular
 endothelial cells during inflammation, and by suppressing either the inflammation or the
 immune cell activity, prevents reactive glial cells from interfering with neurons.




 ricchi 5     synapse micro-environment
the tip of a neuron is called a synapse and has a swelled nodular               ■synapse micro-environment
shape. synapses do not appress adjacent neurons and this slight
gap between neurons is called a synaptic gap. in a synaptic
gap, an electric signal is changed into a chemical substance
(a neurotransmitter) that transmits information to the next
neuron. when an electric signal is transmitted to the synapse,
a neurotransmitter from the synapse vesicle is secreted in the
synaptic gap and binds with a receptor in the cell membrane
of the next neuron. an electric signal impulse then occurs and
information is transmitted to the next neuron. in dementia patients,
accumulation of abnormal proteins such as aβ and overreactions
of neuro-inflammation interfere with the synapses, which leads to
loss of synapses and death of neurons.
   eisai is working on projects to revitalize neurons by improving
the synapse micro-environment and restoring synapse function.
in this way, through the reactivation of residual functions, we are
aiming to cure alzheimer’s disease and prevent neuron death.


 main ongoing project
 •epha4 synapse modulator
 as one approach, we are investigating the development of an alzheimer's disease treatment that works by inducing stabilization of the
 synapses through enhancing cleavage of epha4, a protein which regulates maintenance and formation of synapse. it is thought that the
 severed epha4’s c-terminal fragments play an important role in maintenance of synapses. in fact, there have been reports of reduced
 epha4 cleavage observed in alzheimer's disease patients.



 ricchi 6     neuronal regeneration
the brain is composed of neurons, glial cells and blood vessels. glial cells account for the largest part of all brain cells in
humans while astrocytes account for the largest number of cells in the cerebral cortex. in the same manner as neurons,
astrocytes receive neurotransmitters in the synapses that are the points of contact between neurons and then release
various neurotransmitters, and this process is believed to regulate the efficiency of information transmission and influence
memory and learning.
  while other companies and academics are attempting to treat neurodegenerative disease through neuron transplants,
eisai has set its sights on astrocytes and is focusing on maintenance of brain durability. in this field, eisai is working on
projects to develop next generation treatment methods.

                                                                     35                                              eisai integrated report 2017

what is dementia?
dementia is a condition characterized by the occurrence of a variety of disorders and the emergence of impediments
to everyday life due to the death of brain cells and a worsening of cognitive functions resulting from various causes.
there are different types of dementia. symptoms of alzheimer’s, the most prevalent dementia, are mainly those related
to memory impairment (core symptom), while behavioral and psychological symptoms (bpsd) such as delusions and
hallucinations, violence, wandering and depression can also be observed. other types of the disease include dementia
with lewy bodies and vascular dementia, among others. all of these are characteristically progressive.


medicine creation targeting the accumulation of aggressive factors
marketed treatments for alzheimer’s disease (ad), including eisai’s aricept, are designed to delay the progression of the
disease. unmet medical needs for dementia treatment still remain high. eisai currently collaborates with biogen inc., a
pharmaceutical company focused on neurodegenerative diseases, in developing next generation agents targeting beta
amyloid (aβ) and tau, the so-called causal substances of ad.
  ad is associated with the occurrence of neuronal cell death as a result of the gradual accumulation of proteins in
the brain, called aβ from long before the onset of symptoms, such as memory impairment. the accumulation of
aβ is considered to accelerate the tau pathology and might be the cause of neuronal cell death, resulting from the
accumulation of tau. the accumulation of aggressive factors such as aβ and tau is considered to be the potential target
of ad treatment.

               accumulations of aβ begin more than 15 to 20 years prior to
               the appearance of alzheimer’s disease symptoms. various
               changes occur within the brain up to the point when
               abnormalities in clinical cognitive functions can be observed.

the development of next generation ad treatments has focused on aggressive factors, such as aβ and tau. eisai
collaborates with biogen inc. in developing bace inhibitor elenbecestat (e2609) and anti aβ protofibrils antibody
ban2401 which target aβ. eisai also has the option rights to the anti-aβ antibody aducanumab and the anti-tau
antibody biib076, which are being developed by biogen inc. furthermore, eisai is conducting a study for the in-house
anti-tau antibody. as aβ and tau accumulate in a multilayered manner, the glial cells that play a part in the phagocytosis
of aβ and tau excessively release inflammatory factors and others, causing disorder to the nerve cells by remaining active
for a long time (reactive glial cells). eisai is conducting a drug discovery study for e6011, targeted at reactive glial cells.
   in recent years, the occurrence of transformation of symptoms over time has become increasingly known: it starts
as a sleep disorder 10 to 20 years before the diagnosis of dementia, followed by behavioral disorder then cognitive
impairment, in that order. possible forms of sleep disorders, beside basic ones, include rem sleep behavior disorder (rbd)
and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (iswrd) among others. rbd and iswrd are considered to be closely related
to dementia. depression, epilepsy, anxiety, dysosmia and other forms of behavioral disorders are considered to follow
sleep disorders due to the accumulation of aβ.
   the brain has a mechanism for protection. it is a known fact that protective genes and positive environmental factors
function to maintain homeostasis. reported protective mechanisms include a function for phagocytizing and eliminating
aβ and other foreign matter that occurs within the brain, a function for healing damaged nerve cells and a function
for facilitating the regeneration of nerve cells through the differentiation of neural stem cells, among others. this brain
maintenance system may be the new target of drug discovery aimed at curing dementia.
   eisai considers that the future efforts to develop dementia treatments should focus on the process of accumulation
of aggressive factors such as aβ, tau and reactive glial cells; the transformation of symptoms over time that occurs
in the order of sleep disorder, behavioral disorder and cognitive impairment; and the brain maintenance system.

medicine creation targeting at transformation symptoms over time
it is known that sleep facilitates the excretion of aβ from the brain. a sleep disorder may also accelerate the accumulation
of aβ and potentially lead to ad. eisai is conducting clinical studies with lemborexant, an antagonist to dual orexin
receptors, which are involved in the regulation of sleep and awakening; two phase ⅲ studies on insomnia disorder and a
phase ⅱ study on irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (iswrd) associated with alzheimer’s disease dementia.
    after the sleep disorder, a behavioral disorder may occur in such forms as depression, epilepsy, anxiety and dysosmia
in relation to the accumulation of aβ and tau. inhibiting these disorders might delay the onset of dementia. eisai also
develops new drugs for epilepsy and other neurological disorders. for example, e2082 is a next generation ampa
receptor antagonist and e2730 has a novel mechanism of action. furthermore, eisai develops e2027, a pde9 inhibitor
against behavioral disorders and cognitive impairment due to dementia with lewy bodies/dementia. eisai also conducts
a study for drug discovery targeting epha4, which concerns synapse stabilization.


medicine creation targeting at brain maintenance system
it is a known fact that the brain has many protective mechanisms to maintain robustness. the brain consists of
nerve cells, glial cells and blood vessels. glial cells function to facilitate the survival of nerve cells and to maintain and
metabolically support the intracerebral environment. glial cells are said to be nearly 10 to 50 times larger than nerve cells
in quantity and occupy the largest part of cells in the human brain.
    astrocyte, the most common type of glial cell, is known to receive neurotransmitters and release different transmitters,
as nerve cells do. astrocyte is also considered to structurally support the brain and acts as a mechanism for stimulating
neural transmission and nourishment.
    microglia, a type of glial cell, is known as the cell with an immunity function in the nerve center. in a normal state, it
monitors the surrounding environment while moving the slender process. when it is activated in a pathological condition,
it moves to the disease site and plays roles such as phagocytizing damaged cells and extracellular proteins such as aβ.
    the brain maintainance system supported by these protective mechanisms can be considered an important new target
of drug discovery aimed at the curing of dementia.


eisai’s resources based on the maximum use of experience and knowledge toward
development of dementia treatments
it is considered that achieving the primary endpoint in a clinical study requires the satisfaction of four elements, such
as the right drug discovery target, right patients, right dosage, and right clinical evaluation indicators. targeting aβ is
based on strong human evidence such as pathological findings of ad postmortem brains, gene mutation of familial ad
and gene mutation to prevent the onset of ad. eisai practices unique inventions for leading developments into success,
leveraging over three decades of accumulated knowledge and know-how since the company launched its dementia
study at tsukuba research laboratories in 1983.

     eisai’s initiatives in dementia area extend beyond merely providing pharmaceuticals. eisai also
     undertakes a variety of activities for solving issues faced by patients and the community and for building
     a foundation for a society that coexists with dementia. in this section, we introduce some of those
     specific activities.

the periphery of cancer cells is surrounded by tissue called stroma. in the stroma, connective tissues including immune
cells, inflammatory cells, tumor vessels, lymphatic vessels and collagen, form a distinctive structure called the cancer
microenvironment. halaven is reported to have unique mechanisms of action in the cancer microenvironment including
an effect that inhibits cell division while promoting the epithelial state of breast cancer cells. meanwhile, lenvima is known
to demonstrate an anti-tumor effect and inhibit angiogenesis in the cancer microenvironment.

      halaven (generic name: eribulin) is a halichondrin class microtubule dynamics inhibitor with a novel mechanism of
      action. halaven is a synthetic analog of halichondrin b derived from the marine sponge halichondria okadai that shows
      an antitumor effect by arresting the cell cycle through inhibition of the growth of microtubules. it has been reported
      that recent non-clinical studies show novel mechanisms of action that include improving vascular perfusion in tumors,
      inducing cell epithelization in breast cancer cells and reducing the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells.

reviews by the eisai scientific advisory board (esab)

eisai set up esab, consisting of world-renowned scientific advisors, in 2007 with the aim of improving the quality of drug creation
activities. esab meetings are held regularly and attended by the ceo and members of the leadership team concerned with drug
creation. this enables ongoing discussions regarding subjects such as project reviews and the validity of research plans, backed
up by the very latest scientific insight.

reducing r&d expenditure per approval through targeted projects and partnerships

according to a study＊ published by tufts university in the u.s., the total                    ■r&d expenditure per approval
cost required to develop a single drug was estimated at around $2.6 billion                      (moving average for five years, including indication
                                                                                                 expansions, additional formulations, etc.)
(approximately ¥290 billion) during the period from 2000 to 2010 and has
increased at a phenomenal rate over the last decade. this is further proof that                (billions of yen)
developing pharmaceuticals is becoming increasingly difficult every year.                      40
   eisai puts creation of new drugs right at the heart of innovation and
actively invests around 20% of consolidated revenue into r&d. since                                30

recruiting human resources and developing skills for drug creation

eisai employs a diverse range of human resources, regardless of nationality, to carry out drug creation activities at its facilities
around the world.
   the most important aspect of drug creation is creating drugs that contribute to patients as quickly as possible. a key motivating
factor toward achieving that is spending time in socialization with patients. this is something that eisai is committed to putting into
practice, with the aim of motivating employees to contribute to patients and developing new drugs as quickly as possible.
   eisai also implements the following programs designed to improve the skills of human resources working on drug creation and
increase motivation.
   •international assignment program (mainly for young researchers in japan)
     this program is aimed at improving experience and knowledge of global drug creation activities. we extend overseas study
     opportunities to an additional one or two employees every year and regularly assign employees to work at overseas facilities on
     a short-term or medium- to long-term basis.
   •tsukuba hakunetsu seminars at tsukuba research laboratories (one hour a week)
     this is a series of in-house seminars that give speakers from various age groups the chance to talk passionately about a
     range of subjects, including the latest technologies, their personal experiences as a researcher and new ventures. exchanging
     knowledge between participants not only boosts motivation, but also produces concrete results, including technical
     partnerships and operational improvements.
   •cross-divisional leader training (e-gold, e-ace, etc.) ＊for details, please refer to page 20.
   •unique incentive scheme to reward innovation



ethical and transparent drug creation activities

the eisai group carries out pharmaceutical r&d while maintaining a high sense of ethics based on the hhc corporate philosophy,
complying with the spirit of the declaration of helsinki, various regulations in each country, international standards including
ich-gcp (standards for undertaking clinical trials of drugs), as well as with all relevant regulations, standards and human
rights. furthermore, eisai has internally established a research ethics review committee and institutional animal care and use
committee to give thorough consideration to morality and the well-being of animals in our research, respectively.
   especially in clinical research, eisai adheres to ich-gcp, obtains informed consent from patients and conducts clinical research
in accordance with the regulatory requirements of each country, internal standards as well as trial implementation protocols.
furthermore, when choosing contract research organizations (cro) to outsource various kinds of work relating to clinical trials,
eisai conducts audits beforehand, and according to the eisai group’s policy and standards, continuously assesses cro activities
and takes responsibility for their management. in addition, from fiscal 2015, the eisai group determined its “policy on clinical trial
data access and the disclosure of clinical trial information”, and promotes the responsible sharing of clinical trial data to facilitate
advances in medicine and chemistry.

    intellectual property strategies



protection and reinforcement of intellectual property

the legal protection and effective utilization of products and technologies we develop are essential for the sustained growth and
advancement of eisai, and for eisai to continue to provide a stable supply of pharmaceuticals to patients. therefore, we pursue a
number of strategic intellectual property activities and strategies related to our product portfolio and product creation operations.

1. intellectual property activities
the intellectual property department has stationed persons responsible for intellectual property at eisai’s r&d facilities around
the world and conducts activities globally relating to patents, trademarks, designs and copyrights while working closely with
each group of the r&d department. furthermore, the filing of patent applications, acquisition of rights and prior art searches are
carried out through close collaboration with r&d and business divisions. in addition, when eisai introduces new technologies and
promising new candidate compounds, it cooperates with relevant organizations and emphasizes the steadfast protection of patent
rights while ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

2. drug creation activities and intellectual property strategies
besides exclusivity that protects prescription pharmaceutical candidate investigational compounds, for discoveries such as active
ingredient applications, manufacturing methods, formulations and intermediates as well, the intellectual property department
cooperates closely with the r&d department to ensure that pharmaceutical products are properly protected after launch and
focuses on strategic patent applications and the acquisition of rights. we aim for optimal patent portfolio management that also
includes screening methods and biomarker measurement in drug creation activities.
   additionally, eisai places high importance on patent searches of other companies in its intellectual property strategies and also
gives sufficient consideration to respecting the rights of third parties.

3. contributions to licensing-related activities
rather than simply looking to third-party licensing fees on patents as a revenue source, we strive to create a strong patent portfolio
that will contribute to our business.
   regarding the possible use of treatments for diseases occurring specifically in areas with inconvenient access to medicines, we
plan to proactively out-license our patents. for neglected tropical diseases (ntds), in particular, we are striving to conduct the most
efficient research on drug discovery by opening up our patent portfolio externally, sharing goals and commitment with a wide range
of partner organizations and combining ideas, technologies and knowledge.

4. number of registered patents
to protect the outcome of our drug creation activities, we diligently file patent      ■number of patent applications
applications in japan and overseas. at the same time, to efficiently manage
                                                                                          fiscal 2014     fiscal 2015       fiscal 2016
resources, we carefully evaluate the strategic importance of each inventive
discovery and determine whether to file patents abroad and, if so, how many                   87              65                55
and in which country to file them.

5. trademarks
eisai develops product names for all pharmaceuticals that are protected by trademark rights, and implements brand strategies
throughout the world in collaboration with the marketing division.

   aims to secure appropriate pricing
   eisai aims to secure appropriate pricing for our products in order to deliver the medicines we create to as many patients as
   possible.
      realizing our corporate mission involves the integration of innovation in the discovery of new medicines that fulfill unmet
   medical needs with the securing of access to medicines that enable to deliver our newly developed products to more
   patients around the world. in order to ensure the sustainability of these initiatives, it is necessary that the value of innovation
   is appropriately assessed. however, in this environment of rising social welfare spending, there is a growing concern that
   the price of innovative new medicines is a contributing factor to increasing healthcare costs. as a result, there is a greater
   demand for evidence from the clinical trials that comprehensively demonstrates the appropriateness of the price of new
   medicines from various perspectives.
      at eisai, the global value & access unit (gv&a) has implemented a strategy for pricing new medicines appropriately
   from the perspectives of health economics and outcome research (heor) and health technology assessment (hta).
   under the leadership of the unit president in the u.k., the activities are deployed globally, with the u.s. unit responsible for
   evaluating the economic efficiency of new medicines and the regional and national representatives in charge of medicine
   prices and access to medicines. gv&a summarizes the value of new medicines and creates the value dossier based on
   the perspective of economic efficiency obtained from the improvement of patients’ quality of life (qol) in addition to the
   efficacy and safety obtained from clinical trials. in this way, gv&a ensures the attainment of appropriate medicine prices in
   the markets of many different countries and aims to secure patients’ access to the new medicines.

                              eisai’s general policy on product quality


“the quality of every single tablet, capsule and ampule that
     we produce is integral to the life of the patient.”
   this is eisai’s general policy on product quality, with each employee keenly aware that every medicine
   manufactured by eisai is directly linked to patients’ lives. it is this conviction that is reflected in every
   aspect of our production activities and we believe that as long as there are people around the world in
   need of medicine, there exists a mission and a responsibility to continue to assure the stable supply of
   high-quality pharmaceutical products. to achieve this, eisai consistently strives for high quality through
   the introduction of a robust management system that oversees all processes from drug substance and
   formulation research to production and distribution.



 global quality assurance activities

 eisai believes that quality must be assured until pharmaceutical products are delivered to and used by patients and
 consumers who need these products. eisai implements quality control in the manufacturing phase in accordance with
 its globally unified good manufacturing practice (gmp) standards (international regulations for production and quality
 management), while placing emphasis on maintaining product quality in the distribution phase. under this global quality
 assurance system, eisai is carrying out quality assurance activities to supply pharmaceutical products that can be used by
 patients with confidence in every country and region.
    the quality assurance departments within the eisai group strive to supply products that generate customer satisfaction by
 pursuing quality that satisfies both the apparent and latent needs of patients and customers.



 ■ initiatives to strengthen pharmaceutical quality system
 eisai is working to strengthen a pharmaceutical quality system that meets patient needs for the stable and continuous supply
 of products that have met safety and efficacy standards based on “ich q10 pharmaceutical quality system guidelines.”




 initiatives for stable supply
 — formulating a business continuity plan (bcp)

 eisai has formulated a business continuity plan (bcp) to ensure stable supply in case of risks such as natural disaster,
 accident or act of terrorism. even in the event of a large earthquake, we are committed to resuming plant operations as soon
 as possible and continuing the stable supply of products by consistently ensuring appropriate product inventory. additionally,
 we are undertaking initiatives for securing backup sites that enable alternate operations in times of emergency, primarily for
 specific products, especially products with a high degree of urgency and importance.

initiatives for sustainable development goals (sdgs)


the 17 sustainable development goals (sdgs) of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which was
adopted by the leaders of the world in september 2015 at the united nations summit, officially came into force on
january 1, 2016. toward 2030, with these goals that universally apply to all, each country will mobilize efforts to end
all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind.
   with the corporate philosophy of hhc in mind, eisai has been conducting various initiatives, not limiting to making
medicines, but expanded to improving access to medicines or providing solutions to regional healthcare systems,
and so on. the medium-term business plan ‘eway 2025’ sets out a goal for eisai to become a “medico societal
innovator”, or in other words, “a company that changes society through making medicines and providing solutions”.
in order to realize this corporate aspiration, eisai works on eliminating various gaps on treatment or care, that exist
throughout the world. and eisai believes that these initiatives lead to the achievement of the united nation’s 17
sustainable development goals (sdgs).

introduction of an example of our initiatives for sdgs
inclusive activities toward the elimination of lymphatic
filariasis (lf) at yarada village in india
in 2013, vizag plant of eisai india started production of high quality dec tablets and distribution across the globe at price
zero following an agreement with who.
   at yarada, a beautiful coastal village with the population of approximately 3,500 people, situated 30km away from vizag
plant, more than 50 people were suffering from lf at the time. poor health environment due to lack of awareness and
socioeconomic factors in the community were causing mosquito breeding leading to vector borne diseases including lf.
when eisai staff interacted with the villagers, they had learnt that not only providing medicine, but also solving the root
causes of the diseases through inclusive activities with the local people was essential. then, various initiatives had started.

approaches to infrastructure
in october 2013, eisai entered into a public-private partnership with the state government’s
health department to support their vector borne diseases control activities at yarada village.
   to improve sanitation and infrastructure, eisai staff supported the anti-larval operations
through ensuring regular spraying of the anti-larval chemicals in the water logged areas and open
drains. on the weekends, eisai staff visited the village to monitor cleaning of the areas which
were conducive to mosquito breeding, and also helped repair the old public toilets. in a measure
to prevent further mosquito breeding, mosquito repellant plants were planted near homes and              repaired pubic toilet in yarada
                                                                                                         village
open drains. awareness was created among the villagers by the staff, regarding precautions to
be taken against the vector borne diseases and proper disposal of waste.

approaches by treatment drugs
as it was important to conduct disease awareness to let the people understand the significance of the treatment by drug in
the area where taking medicine was uncommon, the disease awareness was conducted thoroughly. in january 2014, over
60 eisai staff supported mass drug administraction (mda) program in elimination of lf at yarada. eisai staff visited the village
for 3 nights before the date, making announcement of mda through “dandora”, which involves the beating of drums, to invite
as many villagers to participate. days after mda, they visited each household to ensure that all the residents had taken the
treatment drugs.

zero incidence of lf
sentinel survey was conducted in february 2017 by the state health department for screening the patients for wuchereria
bancrofti (a parasitic worm which causes lf), and no new cases of lf were identified in the village since the previous survey
in november 2013. now realizing that their children and grandchildren’s generation will no longer suffer from lf, the villagers
were feeling more positive.

beyond lf; sustainable growth through inclusive development
in october 2014, massive cyclone “hudhud” hit yarada and caused severe damage.
eisai supported the educational institution, zilla parishad school by restoring the
school building and donating drinking water tanks and a newly built laboratory.
also it classes were offered by it technician from vizag plant. restoration enabled
the students who were forced to study at school far from home, to return to their
local school. on december 2016, the local english paper the hindu, reported
eisai staff’s visit to zilla parishad school. in the article, the head master told that
the pass percentage (of secondary school certificate exam) during the last two
years had improved to 97 percent in 10th grade and several students had received memorial of reconstruction of zilla parishad
scholarships from the government.                                                       school



                                            increased motivation among employees
                                            interacting with the lf patients at yarada, i understood the
                                            severe condition that the patients were suffering from. i am
                                            really proud of eisai for helping people from contracting such
                                            a disease. every morning when i come to work i feel that i am
                                            contributing in my own way in caring for the patients and their
                                            families.
                                               we produce medicine at vizag and deliver to the patients.
                                            likewise, through the disease awareness and other activities,
                                            we saw that people gain healthy life. i expect people to
                                            overcome poverty eventually. following this success, we were          madanmohan

       corporate governance system
       our supervisory and executive functions have been clearly separated from each other for more
       than a decade in pursuit of a system that is oriented toward independence and neutrality.




eisai has pursued the best corporate governance practices and has remained committed to the improvement of this governance for
the purpose of fulfilling hhc, the company’s corporate philosophy. since june 2000, eisai has appointed directors from outside the
company, and in june 2004, eisai revised its articles of incorporation at the annual general shareholders’ meeting and adopted
the company with committees system (currently, company with a nomination committee, etc., system). at the same time, the
number of outside directors has been increased to account for the majority of the board of directors. this is intended to ensure the
fairness and transparency of our business management and, as a consequence, the management supervision function has been
strengthened.
   eisai remains committed to the sustainable improvement of its corporate governance in pursuit of increasing the benefits to
stakeholders including patients, customers, shareholders and employees.



                             ●adopted the company with committees system in 2004 and clearly separated its
                               management oversight functions from business execution functions.
                             ●since 2004, more than half of eisai’s directors are outside directors.
                             ●since 2005, the chair of the board of directors has been chosen from among the outside
                               directors. the representative corporate officer and ceo is the only director serving
                               concurrently as a corporate officer.
                             ●the members of the nomination committee and the compensation committee comprise
                               outside directors only. the majority of the members of the audit committee are outside
                               directors.
                             ●each chair of the above committees is an outside director.
                             ●the internal control system and its operation have been improved to ensure the credibility
                               of financial reporting and others.

features of eisai’s corporate governance
❶clear separation of the functions between supervision of management and the execution of business
the core aspect of eisai’s corporate governance system is the clear separation of the supervision of management and
the execution of business through which maximum benefit is obtained from eisai’s status as a company with a
nomination committee, etc., system. eisai has established that the chair of board of directors be an outside director
and that the ceo is the only director serving concurrently as a corporate officer to achieve this goal.
the board of directors is able to devote its attention to management by entrusting a large portion of decision-making authority to
corporate officers. this enables corporate officers to increase the effectiveness and flexibility of business execution and to enhance
the dynamics of management, as well as ensuring autonomy by establishing internal controls.
the corporate officers fulfill their accountability by making reports to the board of directors on the status of the execution of their
assigned activities, both quarterly and upon request. based on the reports from the corporate officers, the board of directors
keeps up-to-date on matters such as the progress of our business plans, the current status and issues of our operations, labor
management, occupational health and safety, efforts for environmental protection and the status of efforts to meet compliance
requirements such as the prevention of corrupt acts and bribery. in this way, the board supervises the execution of operations.
under this system, along with checking the status of execution of operations, the board of directors also inspects the status of
internal controls such as business execution and decision-making processes from the perspective of shareholders and society.

❷ensuring the independence and neutrality of outside directors
the presence of seven independent and neutral outside directors, who account for the majority of the members of the
board of directors, supports the effective operation of eisai’s corporate governance system. eisai’s nomination committee is
composed exclusively of outside directors. the nomination committee strictly applies the “requirements for the independence
and neutrality of outside directors”, stipulated by the committee, for the selection of candidates for outside directors.

❸diversity of outside directors
the nomination committee emphasizes composing board of directors with directors who have diverse expertise,
experience and backgrounds. the expectation is that by doing so, the board of directors will contribute to the enhancement of
corporate value by providing oversight of the efficiency, appropriateness, etc., of management from the viewpoint of a wide range

❹initiatives for the continuous enhancement of corporate governance
a) outside directors meeting
   the outside directors meeting (with only outside directors in attendance) is held on a regular basis. the meeting
   provide outside directors with valuable opportunities to interact, communicate at a more profound level, and make discussions at
   the board of directors, etc., more dynamic and productive. at outside directors meetings, participants freely discuss corporate
   governance and business-related matters. their discussions may be reported to the board of directors or the corporate officers
   as necessary.
      outside directors’ meeting reviews the effectiveness of the board of directors’ management supervision function on an annual
   basis. if any issues in the operation of the board of directors, etc., are identified, improvements are proposed to the board of
   directors.
b) corporate governance review
   the board of directors discusses the effectiveness of its management supervision function on an annual basis and
   also reviews the corporate governance guideline and rules relating to internal control. the results of the self-
   review are summarized as the corporate governance review.
      formulated by the board of directors, the corporate governance guideline is the code of conduct in terms of eisai’s
   corporate governance. eleven directors review the duties of the board of directors defined in the guideline, the performances
   of the chair of the board of directors, company directors, outside directors, the nomination committee, audit committee
   and compensation committee, outside directors’ meetings and the operations of the board of directors and committees.
   the results of the review are summarized at the outside directors’ meeting for resolutions by the board of directors.
   the outside directors, who are independent from the management and well-informed about the activities of eisai’s board of
   directors, discuss and summarize the results of the review submitted by eisai’s directors. this ensures greater accuracy and
   objectivity of the review.
      the results of the fiscal 2016 corporate governance review are stated in the notice of convocation of the 105th ordinary
   general meeting of shareholders.

compliance with the corporate governance code
eisai ensures full compliance with all 73 principles of the corporate governance code adopted by the tokyo stock exchange in
june 2015. the eleven principles that require the disclosure of information are detailed in the corporate governance report. in
addition, the corporate governance report discloses the company’s audit system, compensation for directors and corporate
officers (e.g. procedure for determining the compensation calculation method), internal control system and requirements concerning
the independence and neutrality of outside directors.
for detailed information, see the corporate governance report:▶ http://www.eisai.com/company/cgregulations.html


  performance-based compensation for corporate officers
  the directors are in a position of being independent from the execution of business duties and their compensation is set
  at a fixed amount without incorporating performance-based compensation to ensure that the content of compensation is
  appropriate for enabling the adequate deployment of management monitoring functions, which are the duty of directors.
  the compensation paid to the corporate officers is made up of base compensation, bonuses and stock-based compensation
  at a ratio of 6:3:1, and performance-based compensation accounts for 40% of total compensation.

     the stock-based compensation system, a medium-to-long-term incentive plan, was introduced in fiscal 2013. stock-based
  compensation involves providing corporate officers with stocks on an annual basis through a trust in accordance with the
  degree of achievement of company-wide performance objectives. the system motivates the corporate officers to share profit
  awareness based on the same perspective as that of the shareholders, and to remain aware of performance and stock prices
  in executing their duties from a medium-to-long-term perspective.
     the amounts of bonuses provided to corporate officers are calculated in accordance with the degree of the achievement of
  company-wide performance goal and the corporate officers’ performance objectives.
     the degree of the achievement of company-wide performance objectives is determined after reviewing consolidated
  revenue, consolidated operating profit, consolidated profit for the year (attributable to the parent company) and consolidated
  roe.

  system for corporate officers, the process of the decision on performance-based compensation and the process of decisions by the
  compensation committee on the decisions of performance-based compensation for corporate officers:

    issues?

a : eisai operates the plan-do-check-act (pdca) cycle very
effectively. i have a real sense from board meetings that
outside directors’ opinions are taken very seriously by the
executing divisions. if an outside director raise a question, the
executing division provides a detailed explanation in a sincere
manner. additional meetings can be held to provide more
detailed explanations if requested. likewise, new agendas can
be added for board meetings as a result of new issues identified
by the board. i think this is possible due to the follow up for the
executing division by the experienced members of the board of
directors’ secretariat from the perspectives of outside directors.
   the only issues i have encountered have been minor technical            (interviewer: yasukazu kanamori, executive director, investor

    compliance & risk management
    eisai defines compliance as “the observance of the highest legal and ethical standards” and
    positions it at the core of management activities.
      to contain risks within acceptable levels, eisai is carrying out various initiatives including
    establishing, developing and implementing internal control systems as well as conducting
    internal audits.




eisai designates a chief compliance officer, who is also the corporate officer responsible for internal control, to supervise
the corporate compliance and risk management department and promote compliance and risk management. eisai defines
compliance as “the observance of the highest legal and ethical standards” and positions it at the core of management activities.
eisai implements its compliance program that consists of delivering the message of top management, developing the code of
conduct and other relevant rules, conducting educational activities, establishing a training system as well as providing consultation
services.
   in risk management, eisai defines risk as “the threat or probability that an action or event, will adversely affect the achievement
of corporate and/or organizational objectives.” to contain risks within acceptable levels, eisai is carrying out various initiatives
including establishing, developing and implementing internal control systems as well as conducting internal audits.


1. compliance promotion
the corporate compliance and risk management department works with compliance departments and compliance personnel
in each region to promote compliance globally. these compliance promotion activities periodically undergo objective
reviews by a compliance committee that consists of external experts such as lawyers and consultants from japan
and overseas. furthermore, the compliance committee provides advice and recommendations to the chief compliance officer.

       stablishment of code of conduct and other relevant rules and conducting
     ❶e
      educational activities to foster compliance awareness
     eisai believes that fostering compliance awareness in all officers and employees is essential
     for ensuring that each officer and employee always engages in corporate activities based on
     compliance.
        for this reason, eisai made revisions to a compliance handbook in fiscal 2016, which
     outlines eisai network companies (enw) charter of business conduct and the code of conduct.
     the handbook is available in 17 languages, and was distributed to all officers and employees in
     the eisai group. the handbook was revised to meet social requirements, which included changes
     to items related to human rights in light of the enforcement of the uk modern slavery act.               the compliance handbook
        the eisai group has also created a compliance card that contains the contact information for
     its compliance-related consultation services and shared it with all officers and employees in eisai
     network companies in japan.
        eisai continues to conduct training through various means such as compliance workshops (including those designed for
     directors and officers), e-learning and distribution of case studies in order to foster compliance awareness.

     ❷ use of compliance counter
     the compliance counter serves as a point of contact for the whistle-blowing system in eisai network companies
     and is set up in respective companies. it is a consultation/contact resource that all officers and employees can use
     to seek assistance with interpreting legal provisions and finding answers to questions about whether their own conduct,
     or the conduct of their supervisors or co-workers conforms to the compliance policies. harassment, personal information
     protection, copyright, ethics guidelines for public servants and industry self-regulation are just some of the many topics that
     the compliance counter handles.
        in japan, the compliance counter also provides resources such as whistle-blowing system operated by
     outside lawyers and contact desk operated by the external counselors, creating an environment that serves to further
     promote the compliance.

     ❸ compliance awareness survey
     a compliance awareness survey is conducted regularly to monitor compliance awareness and the status of
     activities among all employees at eisai network companies and to ensure more effective use of the compliance
     program. given the results from the compliance awareness survey in fiscal 2015, eisai focused on activities to increase
     reliability in fiscal 2016 so that people could use the compliance counter with more peace-of-mind.




                                                                 74

❹ prevention of bribery and corruption
based on its strong determination to undertake honest business activities, eisai formulated the corporate anti-bribery
and anti-corruption (abac) policy for eisai network companies in january 2012. this policy provides common
rules for eisai network companies when dealing with external parties in line with efforts to carry out business activities without
bribery or corruption across the eisai network companies.
   as one concrete initiative, eisai introduced the abac due diligence system that uses a web-based system for
receiving responses to a globally common questionnaire on the possibility of bribery and corruption that is sent out
beforehand to companies with which we plan to newly undertake transactions. by using this system, we have already
achieved certain results in reducing risk associated with new business transactions. based on the thinking of a
risk-based approach, this system is being operated giving priority to the americas region that includes mexico, brazil and
canada; the emea region that encompasses russia and eastern europe; and china. eisai is gradually rolling out this system
in india and other asian countries.
   additionally, eisai is moving ahead with the advanced introduction of a system at overseas subsidiaries that detects
signs of potential fraud by monitoring accounting and financial data.

❺ compliance-based promotion
eisai conducts ethical promotion globally in accordance with compliance requirements. we disclose information on payments
to medical institutions and patient groups, in accordance with the japan pharmaceutical manufacturers association (jpma)
guidelines, and the regulations and guidelines of each country in order to have broad societal understanding that our
corporate activities are undertaken based on the highest ethics.

■setting forth a code of conduct in the compliance handbook
eisai has set forth a code of conduct in the compliance handbook that is distributed to all employees to ensure compliance-
based promotion. the following is an excerpt from the handbook.

 ● eisai markets and promotes its pharmaceutical products worldwide. we provide accurate and balanced scientific
    information, and promote our products only for the uses for which they have been approved by the applicable
    regulatory authorities.

 ● off-label and false or misleading promotion and promotion of pre-approved drugs are prohibited as they may raise
    legal, regulatory and product liability issues. the relevant department must approve the content of any promotional
    materials, and we must avoid improper promotional activities.

 ● if we are engaged in promotional activities, we are expected to be familiar with the rules governing promotional
    activities.


■formulation of eisai co., ltd. code of practice

code of practice” (“ifpma code”) as a code covering not only marketing activities but also interactions with healthcare

employees at eisai engage in corporate activities with the aim of earning the trust from society by ensuring high level of
transparency, ethics and corporate accountability in corporate activities involving researchers, healthcare professionals and

2. risk management promotion
in accordance with the companies act, eisai’s board of directors formulated the “rules for preparing necessary systems for
ensuring the suitability in the performance of duties by corporate officers.” these rules stipulate that all corporate officers
should identify the risks in their duties and establish, develop and implement internal control systems. in response, the
corporate officer responsible for internal control established the “enw internal control policy”, and is establishing, developing and
implementing internal control systems covering all eisai network companies as well as implementing initiatives for containing risk
within acceptable levels.

      ❷ csa (control self-assessment)
      one of the tools used by eisai for risk management is csa. csa is conducted yearly for all department managers in eisai
      network companies to identify and evaluate risk in their own structure. identified risks are dealt with through workshops and
      others. in addition, csa ensures the effectiveness of risk management by identifying critical company-wide risk
      through interviews and submitting reports to corporate officers and by following up on the implementation of
      risk response by corporate officers.

      ❸ internal audit activities based on international standards
      internal audits are voluntary audits that differ from the audits conducted by the audit committee and the
      accounting audits. the corporate internal audit department is established under the corporate officer responsible for
      internal control. while implementing internal audits globally, the department cooperates with internal audit departments
      in japan, the u.s., europe, china and asia. these internal audits independently and objectively assess whether
      the execution of duties by corporate officers is being undertaken appropriately and efficiently. the results are
      reported to the executive committee and to the audit committee.
         to assure high-quality audits that conform to global standards, the corporate internal audit department undergoes an
      assessment every year by an external assessment committee composed of outside experts in accordance with the standards
      of the institute of internal auditors (an international professional association for internal auditors based in the u.s.).


                                                                                76

respect for human rights based on international law

in placing value on united nations human rights law, the universal declaration of human rights, international treaties related to
civil and political rights as well as international treaties related to economic, social and cultural rights, eisai has formulated the
eisai network companies (enw) charter of business conduct, which encompasses global internal rules, and the compliance
handbook summarizing the charter. the compliance handbook sets forth fair treatment of all employees and the development of an
environment where employees can work with enthusiasm. based on this idea, eisai strives to follow labor-related laws in all countries
where it operates, for example, in terms of minimum wages and appropriate working hours. we respect the human rights and
individuality of each employee and ensure that our workplaces are free from unjust discrimination or other forms of unfair treatment
based on race, gender, age, physical or mental disorder, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, presence of children or
other circumstances. the same thinking is also reflected in our recruitment, human resources development and promotions.
   based on our position of respecting and protecting human rights, we explicitly stay true to the attitude of not tolerating child labor,
forced labor, human trafficking, slavery and any other such acts that may compromise the dignity or respect of an individual by any of
enw or our business partners.
   eisai has become a member of the industrial federation for human rights, tokyo, with the aims of promoting understanding
of global human rights issues and raising awareness of human rights as a company. as a member company, we proactively take
part in meetings＊1, lectures＊2, events＊3 and other initiatives to discuss global trends, problems and topics. within eisai, we have
established a human rights awareness committee that is chaired by the chief talent officer. the committee conducts a variety
of activities to enlighten employees through such means as human rights training, e-learning and human rights catch phrases
based on our policy for promoting awareness of human rights that we devised. we are aiming to fulfill our social responsibility as a
company by instilling respect for human rights as part of our corporate culture.

creating a good working environment

eisai aims to create workplaces where every employee can work toward the achievement of the hhc philosophy with a rewarding
sense of satisfaction. at eisai co., ltd., various working options are available for employees depending on their workplaces to
ensure work-life balance such as flexible work hours and discretionary working arrangements. in addition, the company provides
employees with extensive leave and short-working hours beyond the legal requirements to support their life events such as
childcare, nursing care and recovery from injuries. furthermore, volunteer and organ donor leave are offered to encourage
employees’ social contribution activities. health consultation by industrial physicians and mental health care services are also
provided to promote well being of the employees. through these endeavors, we are striving to create a workplace environment that
enables each employee to play an active role.

relationship with the labor union

since the establishment of eisai co., ltd., employees have been considered the most valuable asset. to this end, and to ensure
that employees feel at ease of devoting themselves to their daily work duties, eisai co., ltd. has been working to maintain a fair and
healthy relationship with its labor union based on mutual trust and understanding and to build a good working environment.
   in recent years, talks between labor and management led to a common understanding that the government-led reforms of working
style should be seriously considered, and that eisai co., ltd. must set about changing the awareness of workers and exploring
new plans without delay. to this end, eisai continues to improve its working environment, for instance, by correcting the practice
of long working hours and introducing a system to allow employees who have to take care of family members to have one work-
at-home day on a weekly basis. based on a healthy relationship between labor and management and by respecting each other’s
circumstances, eisai co., ltd. and its labor union work as one to achieve the common goal of ensuring the happiness of employees
and the development of the company.

occupational safety and health

eisai has established the eisai network companies (enw) safety & health policies based on the fundamental principle of undertaking
corporate activities with respect for human dignity and the highest priority placed on safety and health. the policies stipulate a code
of conduct for safety and health in seven articles, and we prepare a safety and health management plan every year in accordance
with the policies. sharing the fundamental principle among all employees, we carry out activities to secure safety and health with the
aim of realizing a workplace which will not hurt or cause sickness to anyone.
   under the industrial safety and health act, committees have been established at each of eisai’s offices in japan with 50 employees
or more. in the committees, periodic discussions on occupational safety and health are held with labor union representatives.
furthermore, environmental safety committees have been installed at every company, and in order to eliminate industrial accidents
throughout the eisai group, these environmental safety committees set annual plans to further improve the quality of activities and
carry out monitoring of the results and issues of initiatives every six months. in the case of any industrial accident, it is obligatory to
submit a report, which is then shared with all offices in order to prevent a similar accident from recurring in the future.
   similarly, major research and production facilities of the eisai group in and outside japan have established their own occupational
safety and health management systems and are undertaking relevant activities. these sites and facilities are striving to raise the level
of occupational safety and health by appropriately operating their respective management systems and by voluntarily and continually
going through the pdca＊ cycle. furthermore, risk assessments are not only carried out on new facilities and buildings, but based
on the industrial safety and health act amendment in june 2016, are also carried out on positions which involve the handling of
chemical substances. in cooperation with industrial physicians and health insurance associations, eisai also engages in efforts to help
its employees stay in good health and grow even healthier, both physically and mentally.
   in fiscal 2016, we had more industrial accidents than we did in the previous year, but we had significantly fewer accidents that
subsequently necessitated an absence from work. efforts will continue as we seek to completely eliminate industrial accidents.

level. the cdp evaluation system evaluates the status of implementation of a company’s
environmental management activities on a scale of one to eight (a, a- to d and d-) on four
different levels including leadership, management, recognition and information disclosure.
“leadership” is the highest level which only the a or a- rated companies can be classified into.
the highest rating for the japanese health care sector is a-, which only five companies achieved. also see the following links of

＊ from fiscal 2017, eisai has clarified the definition of research and development expenses in order to more accurately reflect the condition of the business, and this has resulted in a portion
of expenses relating to medical affairs activities, such as creation and provision of scientific evidence for health care providers, being apportioned to research and development expenses.
the figures for fiscal 2016 have been revised and restated to reflect this change.

    statement of income -achieved increase in profit-
    while an increase was recorded following growth of lenvima (anticancer agent, product name for renal cell carcinoma indication in
    europe: kisplyx) and fycompa (antiepileptic agent) as well as the contribution from newly added consolidated subsidiary ea pharma
    co., ltd., the group’s revenue in fiscal 2016 finished overall at ¥539,097 million (down 1.6% year on year) due in part to the impact of
    national drug price revisions in japan and foreign currency fluctuations. by segment, revenue from the group’s japan pharmaceutical
    business and asia pharmaceutical business increased. similarly, on a local currency basis, all overseas pharmaceutical businesses also
    achieved growth.
       operating profit totaled ¥59,064 million (up 13.7% year on year) owing to improved performance and efficiency in operations, as well
    as one-off income following the acquisition of ea pharma shares (gain from a bargain purchase) and receipt of milestone payments
    for progress on joint r&d projects. profit for the year came to ¥42,246 million (down 23.3% year on year), owing to the reduced tax
    expenses following a transfer of shares in a u.s. subsidiary in the previous fiscal year, while profit for the year attributable to owners of
    the parent came to ¥39,358 million (down 28.4% year on year).


    statement of financial position -secured financial integrity-
    total assets as of the end of this fiscal year amounted to ¥1,030,764 million (up ¥56,777 million from the end of the previous fiscal
    year). while assets held for sale decreased following the transfer of sannova co., ltd., this was countered by an increase in total assets
    following the acquisition of ea pharma co., ltd.
       total liabilities as of the end of this fiscal year amounted to ¥428,173 million (up ¥31,014 million from the end of the previous fiscal
    year) despite a decrease in liabilities directly related to assets held for sale following the transfer of sannova co., ltd., in part due to an
    increase in total assets following the acquisition of ea pharma co., ltd.
       total equity as of the end of this fiscal year amounted to ¥602,591 million (up ¥25,762 million from the end of the previous fiscal year)
    due to an increase in non-controlling interests and capital surplus following the acquisition of ea pharma co., ltd.
       as a result of the above, the ratio of equity attributable to owners of the parent was 56.7% (down 2.2 percentage points from the
    end of the previous fiscal year). furthermore, the net debt equity ratio (net der) as of the end of this fiscal year was improved by 0.06
    percentage points from the end of the previous fiscal year, to −0.05 (net cash position).


    statement of cash flow -secured free cash flow, exceeding annual dividend payment of ¥42,905 million-
    net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¥75,851 million (down ¥19,766 million from the previous fiscal year). net cash
    used in investing activities amounted to ¥28,596 million (outflow up by ¥21,896 million from the previous fiscal year). net cash inflows on
    acquisition and sale of subsidiaries were ¥19,346 million and ¥6,459 million, respectively. capital expenditures, etc., resulted in an inflow
    of ¥6,102 million.
       net cash used in financing activities amounted to ¥35,440 million (down ¥37,504 million from the previous fiscal year). the amount of
    dividends paid was ¥42,905 million.
       as a result, cash and cash equivalents as of the end of this fiscal year stood at ¥81,953 million (up ¥836 million from the end of the
    previous fiscal year).

   flow of r&d (drug creation research)
as the name literally suggests, drug creation research is research into producing new drugs, which can be broken down into
three stages: drug discovery research, drug development research and clinical research. during drug discovery research,
researchers employ state-of the-art technology to screen for and identify highly effective compounds and also conduct basic
research using external resources. the identified drug candidates then proceed to the drug development stage, where researchers
lay the groundwork for filing and approval around the world by evaluating the compounds’ physicochemical and biological
properties, assuring their quality and safety, and performing process chemistry research into methods of large-scale synthesis and
manufacturing. drug candidates that clear development research are then elevated to the clinical research stage. after three phases
of clinical trials (phaseⅰ, phase ⅱ, and phase ⅲ), drugs candidates that are approved by regulatory authorities can be launched on
the market.
