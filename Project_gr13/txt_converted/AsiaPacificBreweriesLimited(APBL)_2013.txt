what sustainability means to us

 to operate a successful and sustainable business, we need societies and the environment that supports them to thrive along with us. as such, we make it our
 priority to contribute to the economies where we operate by running profitable businesses lawfully and with integrity, producing high-quality products that
 consumers enjoy, provide jobs, pay taxes, create economic and social value while using scarce resources efficiently. we are also mindful that in areas like
 promoting alcohol responsibility and reducing alcohol-related harm as well as contributing to sustained social development, it is insufficient to focus only on
 our internal operations. in this regard, we believe in the efficiency of partnerships with local stakeholders so as to leverage the multiplier effect for inclusive
 growth and sustainable development.

 ** total energy is calculated by converting the electricity consumption to the primary energy used. this is done by multiplying the electricity consumption by 9 to convert to kwh
    to mj, while accounting for 40% efficiency conversion. the unit is therefore mj/hl.

complaints, accidents and fines

we did not receive any environmental complaints this year. however, there were two environmental
accidents with off-site effects. the first accident occurred in da nang where waste water was discharged
into rainwater drainage instead of the waste water treatment system. we already took remedial action at
the da nang brewery. the second accident was caused by a malfunction of the waste-water treatment plant
(wwtp) in mawathegama due to technical faults. the production line was temporarily halted for four days
to undergo investigation and remedy. brewery operation resumed after aerobic settings of the wwtp were
reconfigured. the external public health inspector was satisfied with the quality of the waste water after the
technical faults were resolved and no further actions were taken.
