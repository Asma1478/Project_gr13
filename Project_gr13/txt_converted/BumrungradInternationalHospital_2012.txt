                                    he past year provided many opportunities

                                 the floods that struck thailand late last year
                            were the most extraordinary example. bumrungrad

                            financial support for affected staff, and missions of
                            medical help and supplies to stricken neighborhoods.

          he company continues to grow consistently
          despite a succession of challenging external
          events. the latest challenge was a flood of
historic proportions that induced a 4th quarter
dip in gdp and reduced domestic and international
patient volumes for several weeks at hospitals
across the thai capital. despite this, bumrungrad
increased operating revenue 12.4% to reach
another record high. the hospital’s resilience to
these events is testament to a strong brand that
attracts patients from across thailand and all
over the world.
      this organic growth is both the beginning and
the result of a virtuous cycle. patient demand

serving a large, diverse population allows our           capable mid-market player, the kasemrad hospital
doctors to focus on their subspecialty interest          group. in 2012 we will seek additional capacity
thereby increasing the sophistication of the services    both on and outside of our existing campus to
provided at bumrungrad international hospital.           serve patient communities at home and abroad.
      the company’s strong financial position allows
it to pursue the big ideas that set it apart and
make it resilient. the big idea now is a fundamental
one: serve more patients, both thai and international,
with doctors and facilities in thailand. nowhere
else can we leverage the core strengths of our
physicians, staff and service expertise so well. our
continued success depends on how well we                 mr. dennis brown

serving the community

t   he thai word bumrungrad means “caring for
    the community.” since bumrungrad first opened
over 30 years ago, this meaning has served as our
guiding principle and a constant reminder of our
responsibilities to those we live with and serve.
  the pages that follow highlight some of the year’s
important events and the many ways the company
and its employees care for the diverse communities
we serve.

a comforting resource
for new neighbors

t   hailand’s success at attracting international companies
    is evident in the large and vibrant community of
expatriates who live and work here. in 2011, bumrungrad
served 120,000 expatriate patients. they represent 169
nationalities, from swiss to ethiopian; bhutanese to
brazilian; canadian to indonesian. meeting the health
needs of this diverse community is like being a house
doctor at the united nations.
   pre-natal education for japanese mothers-to-be is one
example of how we serve expatriates. sessions are taught
by our doctor ayumi shibano, an ob/gyn from japan
who herself gave birth to her first child at bumrungrad
two years ago. we also offer programs for japanese
moms and their newborns – an opportunity to meet other
young mothers from their home country and take part in
discussions on health topics with our japanese doctors.

music to soothe the
soul . . . and heal hearts

m     usic can be a powerful force to help the
      neediest members of a community. in 2011,
music helped heal young hearts through rak jai thai,
a charity program co-organized by the bumrungrad
hospital foundation that provides free heart surgeries
for thais who lack access to these much-needed
treatments.
  the all-volunteer group of bumrungrad physicians
and the foundation’s chairman, mr. chai sophonpanich,
recorded a cd and organized a unique charity
event. “when doctors sing to help 500 hearts”
featured songs from a choir of 26 doctors, plus
a special performance by some of the children
who had received free heart surgeries. since the
program’s inception, our specialists have donated
their time to perform nearly 400 such operations.

help in high water

l   ast year’s epic flood affected millions of people
    across thailand. while the area around
bumrungrad was spared, people and businesses
throughout the region – including residential
communities that are home to many bumrungrad
staff and their families – suffered for months.
   the flood posed a significant health risk for many
people. supplies of critical medications were cut off
and thousands in need of medical attention were
left stranded.
   anticipating the flood’s potential dangers, a
mobile medical service went into action. bumrungrad
physicians and staff brought medical care, financial
aid and supplies of food and medicine to remote
communities inundated by the flood. the team
of volunteers visited more than 20 areas around
bangkok and surrounding provinces. they provided
medical care to over 1,200 people and distributed
more than 1,500 flood survival supply packs.

caring for a world
of patients

e   very year more people are crossing borders for
    healthcare. with over 345,000 patients from
outside of thailand, bumrungrad is among the most
popular destinations.
  traveling far from home for medical treatment
requires courage and trust. one way we serve
patients from abroad is with referral offices in other
countries. over a dozen such offices, in cities such
as addis ababa, muscat, dhaka, yangon, ulan bator
and melbourne, offer patients a local point of contact
with a friendly face to answer their questions.
   together with the hospital’s award-winning
website, these referral offices highlight our facilities,
help patients select and make appointments
with appropriate specialists, estimate costs and
plan their trip. most importantly, they initiate the
communication and coordination with doctors and
staff at the hospital. thus the care that is delivered
at bumrungrad begins with caring close to home.

sharing expertise with
the medical community

b    umrungrad physicians are actively engaged in
     the medical community. they take part in
important medical research initiatives, medical
symposia and conferences, both in thailand and
overseas. many bumrungrad doctors spend part
of their time teaching their specialty at one of the
country’s top medical schools.
   a recent example of the way we share our
knowledge is the training program conducted by
the hospital’s spine institute. in cooperation with
st. anna hospital in germany, the institute trains
doctors from thailand, hong kong, malaysia,
korea and india in full-endoscopic spine surgery.
bumrungrad surgeons pioneered this advanced
technique in asia, and are sharing their expertise
so that more patients can enjoy the benefits.

                                                from baht 9,794 million in 2010. the revenue growth was driven by strong revenues from hospital operations during the first
                                                9-months before the impact of the flood situation in 4q11. patient volume increased from 2010, primarily from the international

                                                in 2011, an increase from baht 119 million in 2010 as the result of an increase in interest income and gain on exchange rate.
                                                total revenues in 2011 were baht 11,306 million, compared to baht 10,056 million in 2010, a 12.4% increase year over year.
                                             		 in 2011, the company reported cost of hospital operations of baht 6,599 million, an 11.6% increase year over year from
                                                baht 5,912 million in 2010, in line with the growth in revenues from hospital operations. as a result, gross profit was baht 4,416
                                                million in 2011, a 13.8% increase year over year from baht 3,882 million in 2010. consequently, gross profit margin was 40.1%
                                                in 2011, higher than 39.6% in 2010.

                                                spending for the campus master plan. the company reported share of income from investments in joint venture and associated
                                                companies of baht 83 million in 2011, compared to share of loss of baht 35 million in 2010. the results for both periods were
                                                impacted by extraordinary items, as further explained in the extraordinary items section of this document. the share of income from
                                                kasemrad hospital group was baht 129 million for 2011.
                                             		 finance cost increased to baht 189 million in 2011 compared to baht 68 million in 2010, primarily as a result of baht 111
                                                million in interest expense related to the debt financing for the purchase of common shares of bangkok chain hospital pcl, doing
                                                business as kasemrad hospital group on 18 march 2011.
                                             		 corporate income tax in 2011 was baht 506 million, compared to baht 507 million in 2010, or at the effective tax rate of
                                                25.2% in 2011 and 28.2% in 2010. the lower effective tax rate in 2011 was a result of the sale of a partial interest in the
                                                investment 	in bumrungrad medical center ltd. in 4q11, resulting in a tax loss of baht 106 million. this was offset with income tax
                                                of baht 25 million on a stock dividend from bangkok chain hospital pcl, due to a holding period of less than 3 months prior to
                                                the declaration date.

2. balance sheet
		 as at 31 december 2011, the company reported total current assets of baht 2,704 million, an increase from baht 1,855
   million as at 31 december 2010, primarily due to an increase of baht 633 million in cash and cash equivalents. trade accounts
   receivable was baht 1,110 million as at 31 december 2011, an increase from baht 946 million as at 31 december 2010, as a
   result of higher revenue from middle east corporate accounts. the collection period was 37.2 days as at 31 december 2011
   compared to 33.5 days as at 31 december 2010. total non-current assets increased to baht 10,768 million as at 31 december
   2011 compared to baht 7,297 million as at 31 december 2010 because of the increase in investment in associated companies
   from the purchase of common shares of kasemrad hospital group and capital expenditures associated with the campus
   expansion. as a result, total assets increased to baht 13,473 million as at 31 december 2011 from baht 9,152 million as at
   31 december 2010.
		 total liabilities were baht 6,739 million as at 31 december 2011, an increase from baht 3,082 million as at 31 december
   2010, primarily from an increase of baht 3,570 million to finance the purchase of common shares of kasemrad hospital group,
   and an increase in provision for long-term employee benefits of baht 278 million due to a change in accounting policy.
   in december 2011, existing short-term and long-term loans were refinanced with the issuance of new debentures with 5, 7 and
   10 year maturity dates, in amounts of baht 1,500 million, baht 1,000 million, and baht 2,500 million, with interest rates of 4.13%,
   4.59%, and 4.97%, respectively and a weighted average interest rate of 4.64%. tris rating affirmed the company rating of “a”
   with “stable” outlook, and assigned the rating of “a” to these debentures. the proceeds from this debenture issue were directed to
   repayment of the aforementioned loans, and did not materially change the total outstanding debt balance of the company. the
   increase of baht 3,425 million compared to the interest-bearing debt of baht 1,530 million as at 31 december 2010, was
   primarily due to the financing of the purchase of common shares of kasemrad hospital group. with a higher debt position, net
   debt to equity increased to 0.6x as at 31 december 2011 from 0.2x as at 31 december 2010. the company’s interest coverage
   ratio was 14.9x in 2011 compared to 35.9x in 2010. the decrease in interest coverage ratio was due to higher interest expense.
		 an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of the company held on 8 december 2011 approved amendments to
   terms and conditions of the convertible bonds including the cancellation of the condition that prohibited the company from
   creating any liabilities and indebtedness without prior written consent of the holders of the convertible bonds, the extension of the
   tenor of the convertible bonds for an additional 5 years resulting in maturities on 23 august 2017, and the release of certain
   security interests of the holders of the convertible bonds as of 23 august 2012.
		 total shareholders’ equity increased to baht 6,734 million as at 31 december 2011 from baht 6,069 million as at
   31 december 2010. this increase was primarily as a result of the company’s 2011 net profit of baht 1,588 million, netted off
   with baht 276 million from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting policy for employee benefits and baht 694 million from
   dividend payments. average return on assets (roa) in 2011 was 14.0% while average return on equity (roe) was 24.8%
   in 2011.

         the company and bumrungrad international limited (bil) have pursued a realignment of corporate structure pursuant to the
   renewed strategic focus of the company, which emphasizes growth opportunities within thailand and a more selective review of
   international expansion initiatives. this realignment includes decisions by bil to sell its interests in asian hospital, inc., to not renew
   its contract for the management of mafraq hospital in abu dhabi, and to pursue a further capital reduction process as bil
   becomes operationally inactive during 2012. additionally as part of this realignment, the company decided to sell a partial
   interest in its investment in bumrungrad medical center limited.

  bumrungrad international limited
		 extraordinary items occurred in 2q10 in the amount of baht 63 million and in 2q11 in the amount of baht 50 million.
  during 2010, bumrungrad international limited (bil) completed the sale of its investment in asia renal care limited (arc), a 100%
  indirectly owned subsidiary. this sale resulted in a share loss of baht 59 million to the company in 2q10, which was due to baht
  63 million loss from translation adjustment. also as a result of the sale of arc, bil’s cash balances exceeded its cash
  requirements, resulting in a decision to reduce bil capital. the decision reflects the exercise of prudent financial management and
  corporate governance.   
		 excess cash was held by bil’s 100% owned subsidiary, bumrungrad international holdings (hong kong) limited (bihl),
  which had previously held shares in arc. as part of the strategy to complete the capital reduction by bil, bihl repurchased its
  own shares from bil. the share repurchase transaction resulted in a share of loss to the company from a translation adjustment that
  was partially offset by a foreign exchange gain on the repayment of an intercompany loan between bil and bihl. the resulting
  net share of loss from the share repurchase transaction alone was baht 50 million, and was the primary cause for the company’s
  total share of loss from bil of baht 45 million for 2q11.
		 the above transactions were completed in relation to the capital reduction strategy of bil. on 14 march 2011, the share
  capital of bil was reduced, by way of a reduction of the number of shares, from baht 3,199,336,700 to baht 1,176,000,000.
  after elimination of bil’s retained deficit, the resulting cash distributed by bil to shareholders on 19 april 2011 was baht 1,945
  million. the cash distribution to the company was baht 613 million.
		 extraordinary items occurred in 4q11 in the amount of baht 24 million, as bil completed the sale of its investment in asian
  hospital inc. (ahi), a 56.5% subsidiary in december 2011. the sale resulted in a share loss to the company at the above amount
  due to a loss from translation adjustment of baht 40 million. the sale of the interests in ahi provided bil with excess cash,
  prompting the board of bil to pursue a further capital reduction process.
  bumrungrad medical center limited
		 an extraordinary item of baht 106 million in corporate income tax occurred in 4q11, as the company completed the sale of
  a partial interest in its investment in bumrungrad medical center limited (bmc) in december 2011, resulting in a loss on
  investment. bmc temporarily ceased operations in march 2010 after it had sold its final core asset to the company.

report of independent auditor
to the shareholders of bumrungrad hospital public company limited

       i have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of bumrungrad hospital public company limited
and its subsidiaries as at 31 december 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in
shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and have also audited the separate financial statements of bumrungrad
hospital public company limited for the same period. these financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the
company and its subsidiaries as to their correctness and the completeness of the presentation. my responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on my audit. i did not audit the financial statements of an associated company which were included
in these consolidated financial statements. the carrying amount based on equity method of investment in the associated company
constitutes 26.98% of the consolidated total assets as at 31 december 2011 and share of profit from investment in the associated
company constitutes 8.11% of the consolidated profit for the year ended 31 december 2011. the financial statements of the associated
company were audited by other auditor whose report has been furnished to me, and my opinion, in so far as it relates to the amounts
included for the associated company in the consolidated financial statements, is based solely on that auditor’s report. the consolidated
financial statements of bumrungrad hospital public company limited and its subsidiaries and the separate financial statements of
bumrungrad hospital public company limited for the year ended 31 december 2010 were audited by another auditor of
our firm who expressed an unqualified opinion under her report dated 23 february 2011.
       i conducted my audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. those standards require that i plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. i believe that my audit and the report of other auditor, as referred to in the first paragraph, provide a reasonable basis for
my opinion.
       in my opinion, based on my audit and the report of other auditor, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of bumrungrad hospital public company limited and its subsidiaries and of bumrungrad hospital
public company limited as at 31 december 2011, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the year then ended,
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
       without qualifying my opinion on the aforementioned financial statements, i draw attention to note 3 to the financial statements.
during the current year, the company adopted a number of revised and new accounting standards as issued by the federation of
accounting professions, and applied them in the preparation and presentation of its financial statements.

  tas 23 (revised 2009) borrowing costs
		 this accounting standard requires entities to capitalise borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition,
  construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. previously, the company and its subsidiaries
  elected to expense such borrowing costs when incurred. the company and its subsidiaries apply the new accounting policy to
  borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 january 2011.

4. new accounting standards issued during the years not yet effective
		 the federation of accounting professions issued the following new/revised accounting standards that are effective for fiscal
   years beginning on or after 1 january 2013.
		 accounting standards:
			 tas 12				                                   income taxes
			 tas 20 (revised 2009)		                      accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance
			 tas 21 (revised 2009)		                      the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates
		 accounting standard interpretations:
			 sic 10				                                   government assistance - no specific relation to operating activities
			 sic 21				                                   income taxes - recovery of revalued non-depreciable assets
			 sic 25				                                   income taxes - changes in the tax status of an entity or its shareholders
		 the company’s management believes that these accounting standards will not have any significant impact on the financial
   statements for the year when they are initially applied, except for the following accounting standard.
   tas 12 income taxes
		 this accounting standard requires an entity to identify temporary differences, which are differences between the carrying
   amount of an asset or liability in the accounting records and its tax base, and to recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities under
   the stipulated guidelines.
		 at present, the management is evaluating the impact on the financial statements in the year when this standard is adopted.

                                             		 be impaired. an impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the asset’s
                                             		 fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than the carrying amount.
                                             			 an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

		 recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s
		 recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. the increased carrying amount of the asset attributable to
		 a reversal of an impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment
		 loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. such reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
  5.14 employee benefits
		 short-term employee benefits
			 salaries, wages, bonuses, paid annual leave and contributions to the social security fund are recognised as expenses
		 when incurred.
		 post-employment benefits and other long-term employee benefits
			 defined contribution plans
				 the company, its subsidiaries and its employees have jointly established a provident fund. the fund is monthly
			 contributed by employees and by the company and its subsidiaries. the fund’s assets are held in a separate trust fund
			 and the company and its subsidiaries’ contributions are recognised as expenses when incurred.
			 defined benefit plans and other long-term employee benefits
				 the company and its subsidiaries have obligations in respect of the severance payments they must make to
			 employees upon retirement under labor law and other employee benefit plans. the company and its subsidiaries treat
			 these severance payment obligations as a defined benefit plan. in addition, the company and its subsidiaries provide
			 other long-term employee benefit plan, namely long service awards.
				 the obligation under the defined benefit plan and other long-term employee benefit plans is determined by a
			 professionally qualified independent actuary based on actuarial techniques, using the projected unit credit method.
				 actuarial gains and losses arising from post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits are recognised
			 immediately in profit or loss.
				 for the first-time adoption of tas 19 employee benefits, the company and its subsidiaries elected to recognise
			 the transitional liability, which exceeds the liability that would have been recognised at the same date under the
			 previous accounting policy, through an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the current year.
  5.15 provisions
			 provisions are recognised when the company and its subsidiaries have a present obligation as a result of a past event,
		 it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a
		 reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
  5.16 income tax
			 income tax is provided in the accounts at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities, based on taxable
		 profits determined in accordance with tax legislation.
6. significant accounting judgments and estimates
		 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles at times requires management
   to make subjective judgments and estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. these judgments and estimates affect
   reported amounts and disclosures; and actual results could differ from these estimates. significant judgments and estimates are as follows:
		 leases
			 in determining whether a lease is to be classified as an operating lease or finance lease, the management is required
		 to use judgment regarding whether significant risk and rewards of ownership of the leased asset has been transferred, taking
		 into consideration terms and conditions of the arrangement.
		 allowance for doubtful accounts
			 in determining an allowance for doubtful accounts, the management needs to make judgment and estimates based
		 upon, among other things, past collection history, aging profile of outstanding debts and the prevailing economic condition.
		 property, plant and equipment/depreciation
			 in determining depreciation of plant and equipment, the management is required to make estimates of the useful lives
		 and residual values of the company and its subsidiaries’ plant and equipment and to review estimate useful lives and
		 residual values when there are any changes.
			 in addition, the management is required to review property, plant and equipment for impairment on a periodical basis
		 and record impairment losses when it is determined that their recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. this
		 requires judgments regarding forecast of future revenues and expenses relating to the assets subject to the review.
		 post-employment benefits under defined benefit plans and other long-term employee benefits
			 the obligation under the defined benefit plan and other long-term employee benefit plans is determined based on
		 actuarial techniques. such determination is made based on various assumptions, including discount rate, future salary increase
		 rate, mortality rate and staff turnover rate.

		 registered and paid-up share capital from baht 3,199.3 million (31,993,367 ordinary shares at par value of baht 100.00
		 each) to baht 1,176.0 million (11,760,000 ordinary shares at par value of baht 100.00 each). the associate’s share capital
		 reduction was made in accordance with a resolution of the extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders held on 14
		 march 2011. the company received a return of share capital in proportion to its 31.5% shareholding in the associate on

		 international ltd. is still an associate of the company.
			 using the cost method, the share capital reduction of the associate resulted in a loss of baht 24.7 million presented in
		 the separate profit or loss for the year ended 31 december 2011, as the investment acquisition cost (baht 100.00 per share)
		 is higher than the amount per share returned to the shareholders (baht 96.12 per share).

                                             			 the company and subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk primarily with respect to trade accounts receivable and other
                                             		 receivables. the company and subsidiaries manage the risk by adopting appropriate credit control policies and procedures
                                             		 and therefore do not expect to incur material financial losses. in addition, the company and subsidiaries have a large

                                             		 parties in an arm’s-length transaction. the fair value is determined by reference to the market price of the financial instruments
                                             		 or by using an appropriate valuation technique, depending on the nature of the instrument.

			 the methods and assumptions used by the company and its subsidiaries in estimating the fair value of financial
		 instruments are as follows:
		 a) for financial assets and liabilities which have short-term maturities, including cash and cash equivalents, trade and other
			 receivables, trade and other payables and accrued physicians’ fees, the carrying amounts at the statement of financial
			 position approximate fair value.
		 b) for long-term debentures, fair value is derived from quoted market prices of the thai bond market association at the
			 close of the business on the reporting date.
			 the majorities of the company and subsidiaries’ financial instruments are short-term in nature or bear floating interest
		 rates; their fair value is not expected to be materially different from the amounts presented in statement of financial position.
		 the long-term debentures with fixed interest rates carrying amount as at 31 december 2011 amounting to baht 4,954.9
		 million, their fair value is amounting to baht 4,979.8 million.

33. capital management
		 the primary objective of the company’s capital management is to ensure that it has appropriate capital structure in order to
    support its business and maximise shareholder value. as at 31 december 2011, the group’s debt-to-equity ratio was 1.00:1
    (2010: 0.51:1) and the company’s was 1.03:1 (2010: 0.53:1).

34. events after the reporting period

    general meeting of shareholders to be held in april 2012 to adopt a resolution to pay a dividend of baht 1.10 per share, or a
    total of baht 803.1 million, to the shareholders in respect of the 2011 profit. the company already paid an interim dividend of
    baht 0.45 per share, or a total of baht 328.5 million on 9 september 2011. the remaining dividend of baht 0.65 per share, or a
    total of baht 474.6 million will be paid and recorded after it is approved by the annual general meeting of the company’s

      the bangkok facility:
      at present, the hospital’s services are offered in three buildings: 
      1. bumrungrad international clinic building is a 22-storey outpatient facility, with the first ten floors being used as parking 
           spaces and the top 12 floors as outpatient clinics and ancillary services. the building offers outpatient services only. 
            currently, five clinic floors are open for service, including the health screening (check-up), heart, medical/surgical clinics, 
            infectious disease, kidney, neurology, pulmonology, rheumatology, urology, and men’s centers together with two non-
            clinic floors for patient services and restaurant. the bumrungrad international clinic building has five floors of outpatient 
           clinics remaining unopened. the company plans to gradually occupy the five remaining floors of this building, operating 
           four as outpatient clinic floors and one as a new conference and educational center floor.
      2. bumrungrad international hospital building offers a combination of inpatient and outpatient services. the licensed 
           capacity for 538 inpatient beds resides within bumrungrad international hospital building, while outpatient services 
           offered in this building include services such as the cancer, dental, digestive disease, children’s and women’s centers. 
           major renovations in bumrungrad international hospital building of both the outpatient clinics, including the women’s 
            center, the digestive disease center, and inpatient rooms were completed on plan by mid-2010. the renovations have 
            taken into consideration patient safety and the needs of patients, doctors and nurses. 
      3. bh tower, reacquired in 2008, allows flexibility in the use of space on the bangkok campus, permitting the shifting
           of office functions out of the hospital building and into bh tower to allow expansion of clinical activities as needed.
           bh tower houses the hospital’s skin center, hospital support services, the vitallife clinic, and offices. it also houses the 
           bh residence serviced apartments, retail shops and restaurants, and 7 floors of parking spaces.  

      bumrungrad international limited 
            bumrungrad international limited (bil) has served as the company’s international investment arm. bil has focused on 
      hospital ownership and management. during 2011, bil divested its last core asset, comprising direct and indirect interests in 
      asian hospital, inc. in the philippines. bil’s contract to operate mafraq hospital in abu dhabi expired on december 31, 
      2011, and bil did not renew given the current focus of the company on expanding primarily in thailand.  
      industry and competition
            in general, the demand for healthcare correlates with the growth of gdp and the aging of the population. from time to 
      time, issues such as domestic political unrest and global as well as domestic economic downturns can affect the growth in 
      consumption of private healthcare. the company believes that with the supply of private healthcare facilities in thailand in 
      exceess of domestic demand, the competition for thai patients remains intense.
            while the global medical tourism industry is expected to see continued growth, the company believes that most 
      international demand will arise from patients living within an 8 hour flight of bangkok. thailand’s regional competitors are 
      hospitals in countries such as singapore, malaysia and india. private hospitals in thailand have a competitive advantage 
      compared to many other countries, as thailand has a unique combination of high quality healthcare, accessibility and 



                                                                                                                                    67

                                                4.1  political, macroeconomic and natural disaster-related factors
                                                            external factors impact the healthcare industry in thailand and the company, from time to time, including global and 
                                                     domestic economic downturns and contractions in activity caused by incidents such as political unrest, flu pandemics or 
                                                     natural weather-related events. in the past year, parts of thailand and certain areas of metropolitan bangkok have faced 
                                                     severe weather-related flooding. while the company’s facilities were not flooded, routine activities for many of the 
                                                     company’s employees and members of the patient community, including international travelers, were adversely affected.  
                                                     although medical tourism is not as easily affected as the typical tourism industry as there is often an established relationship 
                                                     between patients and the hospital and physicians, these events could cause a postponement or a reduction in the number of 
                                                     patients traveling to thailand, and could in turn affect the company’s revenues. 
                                                            in order to minimize the risk, the company maintains a balanced portfolio of international and thai patients so that the 
                                                     company does not rely excessively on revenue from international patients. the company continues to focus on marketing 
                                                     activities related to the domestic market while continuing to work to attract international patients. moreover, the hospital is 
                                                     covered by insurance for property damage and business interruption in case of flood and natural disaster factors.
                                                4.2  intensified competition in the premium healthcare sector
                                                            as private hospitals in thailand and the region continue to develop, competition in the private healthcare sector 
                                                     continues to intensify the risk of losing clients to competitors. 
                                                            in order to maintain its leading position in thailand and asia and to mitigate risk, the company has focused on 
                                                     continuing to recruit doctors of the highest caliber, invested in up-to-date equipment and information technology, upgraded 
                                                     and expanded both inpatient and outpatient facilities as well as continuously improved its quality of care. the company’s 
                                                     hospital was the first hospital in asia to receive us standard accreditation from joint commission international accreditation 
                                                     (jcia). the hospital has also received jci’s clinical care program certification (ccpc) for specialty programs, including the 
                                                     primary stroke program, acute myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus type i and ii, and chronic kidney disease stage i
                                                     to iv. the hospital was also the first private hospital in thailand to receive thai hospital accreditation (ha) and awarded 
                                                     “thailand quality class” from thailand productivity institute. in addition, the company has a strong client base of referral 
                                                     patients both from within thailand and internationally.
                                                4.3 shortage of professional staff
                                                            the hospital business requires personnel including nurses, pharmacists and various technicians, with specific technical 
                                                     expertise and knowledge. a shortage of these professionals is partially due to the increasing demand from both the private 
                                                     and public sectors. given the importance of its international client base, the company also requires multi-lingual professionals.   
                                                            in order to minimize the risk, the company offers competitive compensation and benefits for its staff. the company also 
                                                     provides education and training, recreation, staff engagement projects and staff welfare activities to all staff members. 
                                                     through a decentralized management structure, the company also offers excellent career paths to various categories of staff. 
                                                     in 2011, the company received the “best practice workplace award on labor relations and labor welfare award 2011” 
                                                     from the ministry of labor for the third consecutive year.
                                                4.4  legal disputes
                                                            the hospital business is subject to litigation risk related to the provision of healthcare services by hospital staff and physicians. 
                                                            therefore, in order to minimize the risk, the company has implemented a healthcare risk management system to ensure 
                                                     that the risk of mistakes by the company’s personnel is minimized and corrected. in addition, the company has various 
                                                     insurance policies in place against possible legal lawsuits.

           directors and members of committees whose terms have expired or for any other reasons, including to consider candidates 
           proposed by shareholders, and to propose to the board of directors to approve or to recommend to shareholders’ meetings 
           of such appointment. the nomination and remuneration committee is responsible for considering qualifications of 
           candidates, taking into account their knowledge, abilities, experience which will be beneficial to the company, their 
           leadership skills, visions, ethical values, and their independence in making professional decisions and for ensuring that the 
           candidates possess the qualifications as stipulated in the board of directors’ charter.

                 2. the election of directors may be either by voting for each individual director, or by voting for a group of directors, 
                       whichever way the shareholders’ meeting deems appropriate. for each resolution, each shareholder must exercise 
                       all of his/her votes for one individual director or for one group of directors. votes by each shareholder may not 
                       be split between any directors or any groups of directors.
                 3. the election passes with the majority of the votes. if the number of votes is equal, the chairperson of the meeting 
                       has the final vote.

             the company has entered into related parties transactions to support the normal business of the company. for 
       example, having bangkok bank public company limited as one of the company’s corporate contracts helps the company to 
       expand its client base, as bangkok bank’s employees use the hospital services.

             the company may enter into related parties’ transactions as part of its normal course of business, with normal trading 
       terms and conditions, and within reasonable practice and process, using market price policy, as if doing arms-length 
       transactions, in order to prevent conflict of interest between the company and related persons.

       the company realizes the importance of good corporate governance, and is committed to follow the principles of good 
governance guidelines in order to manage its business with transparency, to build confidence for all stakeholders and to compete 
efficiently at the international level. the company therefore would like to report the following:

1. the rights of shareholders
         the company acknowledges the importance of all shareholders’ rights, including major and minority shareholders. 
   shareholders’ rights include basic rights as investors and as owners of the company, such as rights to buy, sell, transfer their 
   shares; rights to receive dividends from the company; rights in shareholders’ meetings; rights to receive comprehensive, sufficient 
   and timely news and information through easily accessible channels; rights to express their opinions; rights to participate in making 
   decisions on important issues, such as election of directors, approval of important transactions that affect the direction of the 
   business and operation of the company, amendment of memorandum of association and articles of association of the company.
         in 2011, the company has implemented the following to encourage and facilitate the exercise of shareholders’ rights in the 
   annual general meeting of shareholders:
   1. the company gives shareholders the right to propose important and appropriate issues for incorporation as an agenda in the 
         company’s annual general meeting of shareholders and to nominate candidates with appropriate knowledge, abilities and 
         qualifications to be considered for the position of the company’s director in advance before the annual general meeting of 
         shareholders. shareholders can find details of the criteria and guidelines on the company’s website.
   2. the company sends invitation letters to shareholders in advance to inform them of the meeting agendas which include
         opinion of the board of directors on each agenda item, together with supporting documents and information sufficient to 
         facilitate shareholders in making their decisions. in addition, the invitation letter package includes details of required documents 
         in order to protect shareholders’ rights to attend the shareholders’ meeting, together with their rights to vote. moreover, the 
         invitation letter to the shareholders’ meeting is disclosed on the company’s website. for annual general meeting of 
         shareholders, the invitation letter is posted on the website 30 days prior to the meeting date.
   3. for those shareholders unable to attend the meeting, these shareholders have the right to authorize a person or an 
         independent director as their proxy to attend the meeting and vote on their behalf, using one of the proxy forms sent with the 
         invitation letter.  moreover, shareholders can download the proxy form from the company’s website.
   4. the company implements the barcode system for registration and the voting process, including the use of voting cards. this 
         helps accelerate and ensure the accuracy of the registration and vote counting process. in addition, shareholders are able
         to register after the meeting has started to exercise their rights to vote on agendas that have not been voted. upon completion 
         of the meeting, shareholders are able to verify the details. 
   5. before going into each agenda, the chairman of the board of directors, who acts as chairman of the meeting, assigns the 
         company secretary to inform the meeting of the voting process for each agenda. during the meeting, the chairman of the 
         meeting gives all shareholders the opportunity to comment, ask questions or give opinions and suggestions on any agenda 
         item. the chairman and management see the importance of every question and give precise and clear answers. 
   6. the company secretary records minutes of the shareholders’ meetings which are correct and complete, with details on voting 
         results of each agenda. in addition, the minutes are sent to the stock exchange of thailand and posted on the company’s 
         website within 14 days after the meeting date, so that shareholders are promptly informed and are able to verify.

2. the equitable treatment of shareholders
        the company is strongly committed to equitable treatment of every shareholder, whether they are major or minority 
   shareholders, institutional investors or foreign shareholders, and has created various mechanisms, such as:
   1. the company provides a channel for minority shareholders to propose issues deemed important and appropriate to include in 
        the agenda of the company’s annual general meeting of shareholders and to nominate candidates with appropriate
        knowledge, abilities and qualifications to be considered for the position of the company’s director. the announcement has 
        been made through the stock exchange of thailand and the company’s website. independent directors will consider and 
        propose the matter to the board of directors to be included in the meeting agenda as appropriate. 
   2. for shareholders who are unable to attend the shareholders’ meeting, the company provides proxy forms which allow 
        shareholders to specify their vote on each agenda. the proxy forms, which are in accordance with the format provided by the 
        ministry of commerce, are sent with the invitation letter. as an alternative for shareholders, the company also proposes one 
        independent director as the proxy.
   3. the shareholders’ meetings proceed according to the order of the agenda, without adding new and uninformed agenda, in 
        order to give the opportunity to shareholders to study the information on the given agenda before making decision.
        moreover, there are no changes to the important information in the shareholders’ meeting.



                                                                                                                                      89

                                              3. independent directors: four independent directors who possess the qualifications as stipulated by the securities and

                                                    mrs. aruni kettratad.
                                                    at present, the four independent directors account for 36% of total board of directors and more than one-third of the board

                                                    segregation of duties:
                                                    the company clearly separates duties and responsibilities of the board of directors and management. the board of directors 
                                              is responsible for endorsing strategies and supervising management’s operations at the policy level, whereas management is 
                                              responsible for managing the business as per such strategies. therefore, the chairman of the board of directors is not the same

                                                    directorship positions in other listed companies: 
                                                    the company realizes the value of experience that directors receive from being directors in other companies. the company 
                                              therefore has the policy that directors may hold board positions in not more than eight companies listed on the stock exchange of 
                                              thailand, in order for the directors to be able to allocate sufficient time for each company. with regards to the management, other

                                              three other companies. in addition, such positions must be approved by the board of directors.
                                                    company secretary:
                                                    the board of directors appointed mr. banphot kittikinglert as the company secretary to be responsible for

                                              reports, and for safekeeping documents as required by rules and regulations. in addition, the company secretary is responsible for 
                                              advising the board of directors and management regarding rules and regulations related to listed companies and corporate 
                                              governance policies.
