    askey spares no eﬀort in the ﬁeld of research and development. in 2013 we invested in an r&d fund amounting to
    nt$15.1 billion, which accounted for 4.3% of the operating revenue. compared to nt$13.9 billion in 2012, the
    amount was increased. our suzhou plant continuously beneﬁts from the “deductible tax for investments in
    technology development”, a tax incentive from the local government.
    the overall revenue in 2013 increased by about 20% of 2012, with after tax proﬁts increased by nt$47 million. this
    suggests that the company is growing steadily after the strategic re-adjustments of products and organization.

    business risk and management
    global warming is one of the most concerning environmental issues in recent years. anomalies due to annual
    temperature rises result in glaciers melting, rainstorms and droughts which impact upon water resources and the
    environment and even threaten human lives. in 2010 the grand ﬂood of the century in southern china caused severe
    casualties and economic damage to local areas, even transportation was interrupted. an unexpected crisis can bankrupt
    enterprises or cause tremendous damage to them. should enterprises need to quickly ﬁnd an alternative production
    location, the impact on the entire supply chain of the industry can be minimized. for this reason, to ensure business
    continuity by protecting key operating processes against the impact of disasters, we implemented business continuity
    management (bcm) to combine prevention with recovery and control measures. in addition to reducing business
    discontinuation due to major failures, accidents or disasters to an acceptable level, bcm endures employee safety and
    business continuity. lastly, by identifying potential impacts threatening the organization and establishing a ﬂexible
    responsive framework, we not only enhance business continuity capability and competiveness, but also protect the
    beneﬁts of customers, shareholders and the company. based on the emergency events inside and outside of the plant,
    such as ﬁres, explosions, earthquakes, ﬂoods and communicable diseases, we organize at least one emergency
    response exercise each year to improve the emergency response ability of personnel and enable them to get familiar

        materiality analysis
         the csr committee gather relevant departments to discuss the topics of stakeholder concern and develop the “csr
         questionnaire” distributed to stakeholders to collect feedback from stakeholders and the topics they are concerned
         about. after collecting the questionnaires, we calculate the weighting of each item and its impact on business
         operation. finally, after obtaining the weighted mean, we sort the priority of the topics. based on the analysis results,
         topics are placed in the materiality matrix. topics located near the upper right corner are prioritized for handling and
         response. with materiality analysis, we hope to understand the way stakeholders think and their needs, so as to
         respond to their needs in business operation and meet social expectations for sustainable operations.
         major topics identiﬁed are reported in diﬀerent sections of the report to address the needs of stakeholders.

    discuss related labor issues, with 100% workplace consultation having been achieved. although no labor union has

    company to ensure the overall compensation system is competitive in the recruitment market. the company provides
    employees with releases of diﬀerent kinds of bonuses based on local customs, a performance bonus based on
    operational status, and a patent bonus and recommendation bonus. besides wages, we have planned diﬀerent beneﬁts

    besides planning employee insurance and beneﬁts in accordance with the local laws of taiwan and mainland china,
    askey speciﬁcally speciﬁes in the “disaster and illness compensation and relief” clause in the “newcomer manual and
    work rules”. employees who are killed in the line of duty (including deaths as a result of occupational diseases) will be
    given a funeral/burial allowance at a multiple of their average wage, and their dependents will be given death
    compensation. in addition to helping the family to claim insurance, the company will release a death relief fund to the
    family of employees who die not in the line of duty. the company will also plan a fund for the death relief fund in the
    annual budget.

    health and safety
    to provide employees with a safe and comfortable work environment, we have implemented respectively the
    iso14001 environmental management system and the ohsas18001 occupational health and safety management
    system. we have also formed the ohs committee. at askey taiwan, there are seven members in the committee,
    including the chairman as the committee chief and three members are elected by employees, commanding 43% of
    total members. at askey suzhou, employee representatives share 53% of the committee members. the committee
    holds a committee meeting every three months for employees to eﬀectively participate in workplace health and
    safety.

    occupational accident
    in 2013 occupational injuries occurred to ﬁve employees in taiwan; all occurred due to traﬃc accidents. two
    employees were unable to go to work in the following day. one female employee was absent for 24 hours and one
    male employee was absent for 30 hours. the disabling injury severity rate (sr) reduced compared to 2012, as the
    company reinforced the publicity of traﬃc safety, which reduced the number of severe car accidents.
    the company’s production center, askey suzhou has more industrial safety events compared to askey taiwan. in 2013
    there were ten industrial safety events, and no traﬃc accident was reported. after each industrial safety event,
    management investigated the cause and took immediate corrective and preventative action at the same time, to
    correct the situation and eliminate the causes to prevent recurrence. a number of industrial safety event types were
    categorised from all industrial safety events that occurred in the year, in order for management to reinforce worker
    education, so as to prevent their recurrence.

    askey taiwan headquarters in zhonghe built a production line in 2012, the waste needed recycling in 2013 thus
    increased by 20% (mostly production-related waste) compared to 2012. therefore, a temporary waste storage area
    was built in the plant. besides declaring related outputs and storage conditions in accordance with environmental laws
    and regulations, we inspect the hygiene of the storage area every month. after depositing waste to a certain level, we
    immediately ask a contracted legally registered class a waste disposal service provider to clean up the waste, and so as
    to ensure the optimal recycling of said waste.

    electricity consumption of askey taiwan
    askey taiwan headquarters in zhonghe built a production line on the 7th ﬂoor in middle of 2012. electricity
    consumption of air-conditioning or lighting due to the increase in equipment, capability and personnel afterwards has
    since been increasing. there was not signiﬁcant change in the annual electricity consumption of askey taiwan before
    2012. based on the electricity consumption of 2011, electricity consumption in 2013 increased by 447.6mwh,
    equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of the entire 7th ﬂoor. askey taiwan thus implemented a series of
    energy saving measures. in 2013 a total of 66.817mwh was saved. these energy-saving measures will be evaluated

    product responsibility policy and goal
    to ensure product quality and service, we provide customers with related product inspection reports and shipping
    information after shipping, for customers to understand the quality standard and shipping situation of products.
    when product defects are reported from the market after delivery and during warranty is valid, we are responsible
    for the rma (return material authorization) to repair the defects and re-ship products. we also provide customers
    with a repair report. in addition, we analyze major rma defects every week and feed back to the production line to
    make improvement of the subsequent lots in accordance with the following process.

    to ensure product quality and service, right at the design phase we take into account the safety regulations and
    requirements of diﬀerent countries, such as the ul/fcc of the usa, the ce mark of the eu, and the 3c certiﬁcation
    of mainland china. most importantly, all products must meet relevant requirements and past related certiﬁcations
    before mass production. therefore, no ﬁne for violation of laws and regulations related to product/service
    provision and use in 2013.




                                                                                                                         42

    protect the interests of customers
    after receiving customer feedback or complaints, we must respond to customers within 24 hours for product quality
    issues. the actual time of release of the oﬃcial report will depend on the cause analysis. based on the problems
    raised by customers, we will discuss with customers to take corrective action to make improvements to products that
    have been delivered to customers or products waiting to be shipped.

    we have also tightened the scoring policy of the customer satisfaction survey by adding two variables to the original
    questionnaire: number of customer complaints and customer scorecard. two customer satisfaction surveys were
    conducted in 2013 on customers within the top 80% sales bracket of the company. after each survey, we discussed
    items with a lower score and the suggestion of customers and reported the improvement plan to customers.
    customer satisfaction in surveys conducted in the ﬁrst and second half of 2013 was 80.3% and 80.7% respectively,

    supply chain management
    when opening a new supplier ﬁle, we will attach the commitment to integrity of supplier and ask this supplier to sign
    the commitment before starting trade with this supplier. most parts and components are supplied by world-leading
    suppliers. most shells and packaging materials are supplied by local suppliers, accounting for about 6% of the
    procurement amount.
    according to the u.s. securities and exchange commission, all companies publicly oﬀered in the usa must disclose
    information regarding the use of conﬂict minerals in their products. the enterprise’s supervisory responsibility of
    their upstream supply chain is raised to investigate conﬂict minerals with reference to customer requirements. the
    eicc/gesi conﬂict minerals reporting template drafted by two private organizations: electronic industry citizenship
    coalition (eicc) and global e-sustainability initiative (gesi) is applied for manufacturers to validate if suppliers use
    tantalum (ta), tin (sn), wolfram (w), and gold (au) in their parts and if these elements come from the mines in
    democratic republic of the congo or nearby conﬂict regions.

    csr information disclosure guidance for suppliers
    in 2013 askey was selected by the industrial development bureau of the ministry of economic aﬀairs to participate
    in the central satellite system guidance for csr information disclosures. foundation of the taiwan industry
    service provided onsite guidance to help askey to ﬁnish its ﬁrst csr report. during the production period, seven
    suppliers were invited to join our csr report production until the completion of the supplier csr basic report. with
    the csr report, operation transparency is enhanced, the expectations of customers and stakeholders are
    addressed, and the csr concept in suppliers is strengthened.

    “a gift that saves lives” is the greatest expectation of those who donate blood.
    at askey we regularly donate blood every three months. in practice, we invite the taipei blood center to send a
    bloodmobile to askey taiwan for employees to donate blood. this activity provides employees with a channel to
    make a social contribution more easily. employees can donate their blood during a break from work. in addition
    to condensing the fraternity of employees, this demonstrates the philanthropy of askey.

    charity sale
    education is the foundation of a nation. in our society there are still many elementary school students from
    underprivileged families who do not have a good environment to study in, or who cannot aﬀord food or school.
    as a corporate citizen of society, we hope to donate the income (after deducting necessary cost) from the charity
    sale of couplets for the spring festival directly to these underprivileged families, in the company’s name, through
    the savings platform of the ministry of education (https://www.edusave.edu.tw/news.aspx), so as to contribute
    to society. in 2013 we raised a sum of nt$52,699 from the charity sale. the receipts from diﬀerent schools have
    been received recently.
    activity content:
    ．we invited calligraphers mr. chen-hua lin and mr. shi-bo luo to write the couplets for the spring festival on site
      (the price of each couplet started from nt$500).
    ．the couplets for spring festival by the calligraphy class were displayed and auctioned on site (the price of each
      couplet started from nt$100).
