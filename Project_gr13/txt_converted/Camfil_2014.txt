                                  than 50 years ago. from the very beginning, our business
                                  model has been to provide clean air with the most effective
                                  and most energy-efficient filtration solutions on the market.
                                  people, processes and the environment benefit from our
                                  technology. our air filtration solutions contribute daily to

                                  fore a natural extension of our fundamental belief in being
                                  the most eco-friendly air filter manufacturer on the market.
                                  for years we have been constantly greening our technology
                                  and products for customers and end-users, helping them to

                                  leaner and greener to reduce their environmental impact.
                                       with sustainability embedded in our product portfolio for

that can be made by replacing existing air filters with low energy air
filters. as a result of the energy management steps that camfil has
taken, significant reductions in energy usage and improvements in
energy efficiency have been achieved. these improvements resulted in
camfil saving over gbp 200,000 on energy bills through minimal cost,

                                  introduced a new and tougher energy efficiency classification system
                                  for air filters in 2015.
                                       the new eurovent classification places much higher demands on air

across the globe
during one week every year for six years, the whole camfil group has
celebrated and manifested its will to contribute to a more sustainable
world. we call this internal event “camfilcairing week”. for five days,
we carry out various sustainability and corporate social responsibility
activities at camfil facilities around the globe. these activities, which
vary from company to company, range from donating blood to planting
trees and collecting clothes and food for the needy. here are a few
recent examples:
