identifying sustainability issues (g4-20, g4-21)

the evaluation of relevant aspects for aquafil was carried out by establish-
ing an internal interdisciplinary technical committee, which conducted an
analysis on the aspects proposed in the g4 sustainability reporting guidelines
regarding current and future business prospects.                                                        identification of the relevant aspects
the evaluation was based on internal sources, such as the previous sustaina-                                  in terms of sustainability
bility reports, policies and company mission, and external standards and opin-                              (aquafil technical committee)
ions from all involved parties.

this approach enabled us to single out 29 relevant aspects from the 45 pro-
posed by the guidelines.

assigning priority to the identified issues

the interest of business activities, actively involving a panel of stakeholders in                            involvement of stakeholders

stakeholders involvement began when a questionnaire was distributed asking
for feedback on how aqualfil’s management directly affects their own interests
and business decisions.                                                                                   analysis of the questionnaire and
priority assignment and the involvement of stakeholders allowed for the                                          matrix elaboration

           he involvement of the stakeholders in the materiality analysis has led to the identification of

formance indicators; for this reason, in 2013 aquafil designed an online platform (web tool) for
the reporting and analysis of these aspects. in 2014, this tool became an integral part of aquafil’s                  0        20,000       40,000     60,000      80,000     100,000     120,000

the web tool for environmental reporting

the web tool is an online tool for gathering information concerning the environment and for
calculating performance indicators.

in 2014, the web tool became fully operational in the company dynamics. each plant accesses
the tool on a monthly basis and inputs data related to a range of environmental issues such as ener-
gy and water consumption, emissions into bodies of water and waste.

the tool is used for calculating real-time performance indicators and compares them with the
expected value for that indicator. in this way, each plant is able to undertake preventative meas-
ures regarding its progress.
the expected value is evaluated annually by aquafil and is the reference value for the environ-
mental aspect under study.

the reliability of the information entered is ensured by double-checking data and indicators
carried out by the managers of each plant and the platform administrator.




in this section of the report, each environmental aspect was quantified by selecting the most repre-
sented indicator of the group among those recommended by the gri.

the methodology used and the analyses of variations in the indicators over time are reported for each
environmental aspect. many of them refer to the group’s net production in 2014, intended as the
amount of product sold.

one of the most keenly felt aspects for the group is good energy management as it produces
positive effects not only from an environmental perspective (by reducing the consumption of
non-renewable resources) but also from an economic point of view.                                                                                                                                                    18.5%
in order to achieve efficient energy management, aquafil focuses on increasing the efficiency of                                                                                                                     steam purchased

the plants are able to monitor their consumption over time in order to determine whether there are
anomalies in order to implement improvement strategies.

          aquafil’s contribution to the territory


          aquafil helps to create wealth in the community through the salaries they
          pay to their employees, taxes paid to the governments in operational territo-
          ries and money generated by its commercial activities.

          in 2014, which was not a prosperous moment for world economy, aquafil made
          the courageous decision to expand its personnel thus creating wealth and
          prosperity in the communities in which it operates. it distributed €84 mil-
          lion to its employees: the second amount distributed in terms of magnitude
          (17% of the economic value distributed in 2014).

          this amount can be divided between values directly distributed, i.e. the wealth
          given to employees in the form of salaries, and indirectly distributed, i.e. the
          taxes aquafil pays on salaries and social security to the government. the ter-
          ritory benefits from the wealth generated in both cases: salaries allow for
          further economic gain, consumption and well-being, while the tax deducted
          from the employees’ salaries used to finance the goverments and the amount
          allocated for contributions and charges is used for providing welfare services
          and social security to the population.

          in 2014, aquafil paid over € 30 million to the public administration in taxes
          and social contributions, equal to approximately 6% of the group’s turno-
          ver.

          the value deriving from taxes on salaries and social contributions is given to
          the communities in magnitude and composition depending on the country in
          which the group is operating:

           >> in italy, the amount owed to the public administration for expenses and
              contributions is approximately €18 million, equal to 16% of the turnover
              in this country;

           >> throughout the rest of europe (germany, slovenia and croatia) near-
              ly €9 million was paid to the public administration, equal to 16% of the
              group’s turnover in these countries;

           >> in the united states, €2.7 million were allocated to welfare and social se-
              curity which is equal to 3% of the turnover generated in this country;

           >> lastly, the amount allocated in taxes to communities in china and thai-
              land was approximately €318 thousand, equal to 1%.
