    managing sustainability 



as businesses face increasingly more reserved stakeholders as a result
of the economic crisis and the consequent lack of trust in large
enterprises, the need for transparency has become all the more vital.
vodafone greece has worked hard to rise to this challenge and to put
in place suitable management systems certified by recognised bodies.
we recognise that maintaining and building trust, which is of vital
importance, requires unwavering dedication and constant alertness.
to that end, our systems continue to develop as we come face to face
with new issues. we cannot avoid all ethical business issues we might
have to face, but our business principles are designed so as to ensure
that our stakeholders know that vodafone greece always endeavors
to make responsible choices.

objectives we also take into account the impact of our operations
on society as a whole and take suitable steps in that regard with
measurable results. depending on the extent of its activities -
without this necessarily translating into financial outlays- the
company is obliged to reduce the potential negative impact and
bolster the positive impact on the world around it.

       responsible behavior




‘speak up’
since 2006-2007, we have developed and
launched the ‘speak up’ program, a whistle-
blowing mechanism that encourages suppliers
and vodafone greece employees to point out
any inappropriate conduct or practice by the
company or its suppliers. suppliers and vodafone
greece employees have the ability to raise any
concerns they have about the correctness of pro-
cedures and practices implemented by vodafone
greece in the procurement sector by sending
them to a specific email address or by calling to
a specific number. at the same time, vodafone
greece undertakes to complete a timely inves-
tigation, follow-up and resolution of all issues re-
ported. it is also possible to file an anonymous
report about behavior that is not compatible with
the code of conduct, or company policies and
procedures. for more information on the specific
