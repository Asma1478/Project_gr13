           based on the goal of being a “quality first company”

■ considering the entire society as customers
contributing to society by improving technology and quality
jtekt products are widely and deeply involved in industry and society. for example,
jtekt supplies about 50% of the electric power steering systems installed in vehicles
                                                                                                                         'jhvsf  

these products make use of technology that not only contributes to the environment                                    customers’ opinions and proposals
but also plays a key role in quality, and any defect therein will have a negative impact
                                                                                                                                          product pre-planning

human resource development for office & engineering staff
the jtekt training system is composed of three pillars. in rank-based training, the
required knowledge and skills and the responsibilities to be fulfilled by employees at
each rank are clarified and practical training given. in function-based training, employ-
ees are taught advanced knowledge and skills from internal and external instructors
who are skilled in special fields. in workplace-based training, employees are system-
atically taught specific skills related to their job. in addition, we support self-study
efforts by employees to obtain various qualifications.

    respect for human rights,
■   equal opportunity and diversity
utilization of diverse human resources
included in jtekt’s corporate activities standards is the following: “respect the
individuality of employees, create workplaces that motivate employees and enable
them to fulfill their potential, and strive to provide each with abundant living
circumstances.” measures adopted in order to utilize diverse human resources include
hiring foreign employees; assisting female employees’ career development; changing
fixed-term employees to permanent employees; employing handicapped persons;
providing assistance for those engaged in child-care or nursing-care; and providing
post-retirement employment opportunities. regarding fixed-term employees, even with
the harsh management environment in fy2008 we carried out measures such as job
transfers and work sharing to strive to maintain employment. in the handling of
fixed-term employees, we follow compliance and do not cancel contracts or dismiss any
employees unilaterally.

           together with local communities
           recognizing its responsibility as a member of local communities,
           jtekt actively seeks to communicate with local residents to gain their understanding and trust.
           we also encourage employees to participate in community
           cleanup and traffic safety activities as a means of contributing to society.




■ promotion framework
one of the six specialized subcommittees under jtekt’s companywide global environ-
ment conservation committee is the community environment subcommittee. through
fy2008, this subcommittee promoted activities to make jtekt a company loved by
local residents and trusted by government agencies, but in april 2009, the responsibility
for communication with local communities was transferred to the social contribution
working group under the csr promotion committee, and this wg currently promotes
these activities.



■ communication
holding community discussions
we periodically invite local residents to participate in community discussions at each
plant. at these meetings, we report the results of environmental conservation activities,
exchange opinions with local residents, and provide plant tours. we build good
relationships with local communities through such activities. a total of 153 residents
attended such discussions at plants in fy2008.                      related article in page 37   community discussion (tadomisaki plant)




communication through “view a manufacturing site” events
jtekt holds “view a manufacturing site” events to allow local residents to understand
plant workplaces better and exchange information. seven toyota group companies
have been holding such events since 2000. in fy2008, jtekt held such an event on
november 3 at its kariya plant and explained the manufacture of machine tools to 38
visitors. comments from visitors included, “i was surprised to learn how precise machine
tools are,” and “i learned how the plant thinks about the environment.” there have been
requests for such an event at an electric power steering plant, and jtekt is currently
making plans to hold one.
                                                                                                 “view a manufacturing site” event (kariya plant)



deepening friendships through plant festivals
in order to deepen friendships between employees, their families and local residents,
many jtekt plants hold festivals every year. in fy2008, nine plants held festivals that
were attended by a total of 8,557 persons. at the festivals there were stage shows,
games, booths to sell goods, and various other activities. the nara plant gave a plant
tour with product explanations to employees’ children. employees of the higashikariya
plant put on a fireworks display. visitors at each plant’s festival were able to enjoy
a wide variety of activities.

                                                                                                 plant festival (higashikariya plant)

community beautification activities and cleanup activities around plants. this also
serves to raise the environmental awareness of employees. in fy2008, a total of 1,357
employees participated in local cleanup activities.
                                                                                                           kariya zero garbage activity

■ reduction of local community environmental risks
jtekt strives to minimize environmental risk to local communities such as the risk of
environmental accidents or environmental law violation by formulating preventive
measures. we review cases that had the potential to lead to an accident or violation,
identify causes, implement countermeasures, and communicate these throughout
the company so that no such accident or violation will actually occur. we also carry
out training for responding to environmental emergencies once a year.

situation regarding legal compliance
with environmental laws and regulations
in fy2008, jtekt did not receive any fines or penalties and was not the subject of any
lawsuits related to environmental matters.

environmental complaints and accidents
jtekt has established internal standards (*1) regarding amounts of plant wastewater                  *1 internal standards

amounts and strives to prevent environmental accidents and complaints. while jtekt
had no accidents and received no complaints regarding environmental matters in
fy2008, there were four cases in which plant wastewater discharge cod (tadomisaki
plant) and nitrogen content (hanazono plant) exceeded internal standards and that
potentially could have resulted in problems. we thoroughly investigated the causes and
took corrective measures for each of these cases, and expanded these measures to all
of our plants. we will continue to promote preventive activities on a continual basis.

internal audits
although the 2008 internal audit revealed that certain log content was insufficient and
the action plan was partly unclear, no deficiencies were recorded. also, workshops
were held for employees qualified to carry out internal environment audits in order to
confirm their auditing capability and raise their skills. based on such activities, we will
continue efforts to improve our pool of employees capable of conducting these audits.

■ environmental education and training
environmental education
jtekt carries out various types of environmental education such as environmental
awareness education and internal environmental auditor education in order to raise the
environmental awareness and skills of employees. also, in the companywide education
curriculum including classes for new employees, new managers, management-track
employees, and production staff, content is taught on environmental conservation.

01 | environmental awareness education
jtekt carries out environmental awareness education for employees as part of its
“environment month” every june. the slogan for the fy2008 awareness education was
“let’s each think of activities we can do to conserve energy and prevent environmental
problems!” meetings were held at each workplace to discuss and decide environmental
conservation activities in areas such as reduction of co2 emissions and elimination of                               environmental awareness education
environmental complaints and abnormalities.                                                                          (attended by 591 employees)


02 | internal auditor education
jtekt carries out education on internal auditing skills for employees of jtekt and
                                                                                                                        v o i c e

    improvement of fuel efficiency by environmentally
    friendly designs
efforts to achieve environmental designs were focused on such themes as reducing
steering system size, weight and torque loss, which resulted in the reduction of mass,
torque loss and energy consumption of more steering systems than in fy2007. this contrib-
uted to the creation of systems with improved environmental efficiency and fuel efficiency.

transport means from boat to railways and also began shipping products directly from

■ reduction of materials usage
jtekt, mainly through its energy saving subcommittee, one of several specialized
environmental committees, strives to reduce the amounts of primary materials such as
raw materials and secondary materials such as cutting tools and grinding wheels that it
uses. by improving material types, machining methods, etc., we have steadily reduced
usage amounts.
