the iino group’s history dates all the way back to 1899, when forerunner iino shokai was
established at maizuru port (kyoto) to transport coal by barge. during its 111 years in business,
the company has developed a thriving marine shipping business, alongside which its real estate
operations have developed into a second core business.
iino’s shipping business operates a fleet of more than 100 vessels, including oil tankers,
chemical tankers, gas tankers, and bulk carriers, engaged in worldwide transport of a variety of
cargoes that are essential to modern life and economic activity.
iino’s real estate business provides comfortable office environments to tenants of its six office
buildings in central tokyo. our properties include the iino building, which is under
reconstruction toward completion at the end of june 2011.

editorial policy
from fiscal 2009, the iino group combined its annual report, aimed at investors, and its safety and environmental report, aimed at a
broader range of stakeholders, into the iino report, a comprehensive csr and annual report.
the iino report is designed to provide a well-balanced view of the iino group’s activities that will be readily understandable to all
stakeholders. accordingly, the report is divided into four sections: operating review, safety and environmental report, social report,
and financial review.
in this report, the terms “iino group” or the “group” refer to the entire corporate group of 62 companies; “iino kaiun kaisha, ltd.” or
“iino lines” refer to the parent company alone. the report was prepared with reference to the global reporting initiative’s
sustainability reporting guidelines, version 3.0 (2006).

the iino report contains various of the iino group’s future plans, strategies, and earnings forecasts. such content constitutes forward-looking statements
and is based on information available at the time of preparation. actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements

special feature 1




designing a building admired
for the next century and beyond
the iino group is currently rebuilding the iino building in tokyo’s uchisaiwaicho, with completion scheduled for the end of
june 2011. the new building will be a large-scale structure with 27 aboveground and 4 basement floors housing offices, a
commercial zone, and a multipurpose hall. the new building will replace the old iino building completed in 1960. iino group
employees involved in the rebuilding project have shared a common aspiration, that of creating a new building that will be as
admired as the old iino building for the next century and beyond. this section looks at the subject of those aspirations, the
new iino building.

                 an urban oasis linked to hibiya park
connecting people in the heart of tokyo

uchisaiwaicho, where the iino building stands, is an important
district of central tokyo near public-sector offices in adjacent
kasumigaseki and major office districts in adjacent marunouchi
and otemachi. the old iino building thrived together with the
uchisaiwaicho district for nearly half a century until being
closed in 2008. we hope to enjoy the ongoing admiration of
people and the community at large. to achieve that goal, the
iino group focused on “connections” as the rebuilding project’s
fundamental design theme.
the iino building is located near five train stations, making it
accessible via twelve railway lines. harnessing this
convenience will make it possible to connect people with each
other. we are also carrying on the old iino building’s legacy of

connecting people and nature with
greenery

people today place more importance on harmony with
nature than in times past. in planning the new building,
we devised ways of connecting people and nature. the
site faces hibiya park across kokkai-dori street. our
design integrates the building site with the park and its
many trees. visitors approaching the building entrance
from the park will encounter iino forest, a garden with
several dozen planted trees, a verdant oasis in the heart
of the capital. the building exterior will be clad in
rockville white american granite, a white granite with
black graining that imparts warmth and a pristine look.
beyond the forest, visitors arrive at the expansive
entrance lobby, enveloped in white marble. the lobby
connects to the offices, iino hall, and commercial
facilities.
the interior also will convey a natural feel. iino hall on
the fourth floor will feature a large entrance foyer as well
as a foyer and rooftop garden terrace facing hibiya
park. from the rooftop garden, people will have close
views of the park and iino forest and feel as though
they are enveloped by nature. lush greenery will imbue
the local surrounds with a relaxed, tranquil atmosphere
and serve as an emergency response base in the event
of a disaster.
through this approach, the iino group hopes to create
a building admired by the local community.

protecting marine ecosystems
the iino group’s initiatives related to ballast water

                                                     over its 111-year history, the iino group has endeavored to support
                                                     modern life and cultivated close relationships with society. the global
                                                     marine transport industry’s attention is currently focused on the ballast
                                                     water problem. ballast water is seawater taken into a ship’s ballast tanks
                                                     to adjust center of gravity. it can negatively impact marine ecosystems
                                                     because it transports organisms from one part of the ocean to another.
                                                     this special feature explains the iino group’s stance on the issue in light
                                                     of stakeholder opinions from an academic and a non-profit organization.

japan, the debate about protecting biodiversity has not
progressed as far as in european countries. and interest in
protecting marine ecosystems is lower than for land-based
ecosystems. shipping companies coexist with the ocean,
so they must be proactive in protecting oceanic
biodiversity.

the operation of ships impacts the environment in various
ways. the iino group’s shipping business endeavors to
protect the environment by setting and pursuing
environmental objectives and targets in four categories:
(1) marine pollution prevention: prevent oil spills and liquid
chemical product leaks (vessels)
(2) waste reduction: reduce and properly process waste
(vessels and offices)
(3) reduction of natural resource consumption: reduce
electricity and paper use (offices)
(4) air pollution prevention: use fuel efficiently, reduce gas
emissions (vessels).

safety and environmental management in the real estate business




safety, quality, and environmental management initiatives

in our real estate business, we place priority on maintaining safety and amenity within buildings and engage in quality
management to ensure customer satisfaction. we also engage in environmental management to reduce buildings’
environmental footprints. specific measures include those to reduce natural resource consumption and waste emissions at
our buildings.
group company iino building technology is engaged firsthand in building management. the table below summarizes iino
building technology’s attainment level for its safety and environmental management program targets for 2009 alongside
targets for 2010.
two of the iino group’s real estate business companies have obtained combined iso 9001/14001 certification: iino lines
(for its real estate business) and iino building technology.

                                             ● fusing real estate with artwork


                                             the iino group incorporates the power of art into real estate.
                                             we install artworks in our buildings to create appealing
                                             environments and provide artists with venues for creative
                                             expression. through these efforts, we hope to build good
                                             relationships between real estate, tenants, visitors, and more
                                             broadly, society at large.

                                             cosmic flight, a work by mr. akio hamatani, has been
                                             installed in the four-story atrium of the shiodome shiba-rikyu
                                             building (in tokyo’s minato ward). this enormous objet d’art
                                             is 14 meters long and made from a single shiny white thread
                                             suspended in midair. among viewers, it may evoke images
                                             of waves, clouds, a white dragon, wings, and other dynamic
                                             shapes. mr. hamatani described his artistic intention as
                                             follows: “i hope that the piece breathes fresh air into the
                                             atrium as a place of human interaction and inspires tranquil,
                                             hope-filled thoughts.”
                                             the iino group will continue to create buildings and
                                             communities that tap into the power of art. in spring 2010, we
                                             will begin selecting artworks for installation at six key
                                             locations in the iino building, which is currently under
                                             reconstruction.




                                                                                                                         social report
                                             in the words of mr. akio hamatani
                                             artwork and architecture can interact to mutually enhance
                                             each other’s appeal. efforts in this vein are not as
                                             widespread in japan as in the west, so it’s wonderful that
                                             iino lines is pioneering efforts to fuse art and architecture
                                             here. by consulting with iino lines on this project, i was able
                                             to create a work of grand scale that takes full advantage of
                                             available space. its appearance changes depending on
                                             what height and angle you view it from. i hope that it
                                             fascinates viewers and evokes various images in their minds.

notes to consolidated financial statements


iino kaiun kaisha, ltd. (iino lines) and its consolidated subsidiaries

notes to consolidated financial statements

1. basis of presentation of the consolidated financial statements
       the accompanying consolidated financial statements of iino kaiun kaisha, ltd. (the “company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries
       (collectively, the “companies” ) are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in japan. the application and disclosure
       requirements under the aforementioned accounting principles differ from international financial reporting standards in some respects. the
       accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared by the company as required under the financial instrument exchange law of japan.
       certain items presented in the consolidated financial statements submitted to the director of the kanto finance bureau in japan have been
       reclassified for the convenience of readers outside of japan.




2.      summary of significant accounting policies
       a. basis of consolidation
             the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its 45 significant subsidiaries in 2010 (47 in 2009).
             the other subsidiaries are excluded from consolidation since, in aggregate, the combined total assets, net sales, net income, and retained earnings of
             these subsidiaries do not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the companies.
             for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, all significant intercompany transactions, account balances, and unrealized
             profits among the companies have been eliminated.

       b. equity method
             investments in significant affiliates are accounted for under the equity method as of march 31, 2010 and 2009.
             investments in the remaining 13 non-consolidated subsidiaries and 2 affiliates of the company are stated at cost on march 31, 2010 (13
             non-consolidated subsidiaries and 2 affiliates on march 31, 2009) since the company’s equity in their net income (loss), on aggregate, does not
             have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

       c. fiscal periods of consolidated subsidiaries
             the accounts of the consolidated subsidiaries, except for taranaki shipping s.a. and 7 other subsidiaries whose fiscal year ends are december 31, are
             prepared as of the same date as the consolidated financial statements. the aforementioned 8 subsidiaries with differing financial years are included in
             the consolidated financial statements based on their accounts as of december 31 (their fiscal year ends), and necessary adjustments for significant
             transactions during the period between their fiscal year ends and the consolidated balance sheet date are reflected in the consolidated financial
             statements.

       d. foreign currency translation
             all monetary assets and liabilities of the company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
             japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet dates. the foreign exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the
             statements of income to the extent that they are not hedged by forward exchange contracts. revenues and expenses are translated using the average
             exchange rates of the respective periods.
             foreign currency translation of foreign subsidiaries follows the accounting policy of the company and its domestic subsidiaries as permitted under
             japanese generally accepted accounting principles for foreign subsidiaries located in tax-haven jurisdictions.

       e. vessel operating revenues and related costs
             vessel operating revenues and related costs are recognised using the percentage-of-completion method.

       f. income taxes
             the provision for income taxes is computed based on “income before corporate income taxes” in the consolidated statements of operations. the
             asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
             between the carrying amounts and the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded for tax purposes.

       g. net income and dividends per share
             net income per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year,
             appropriately adjusted for stock splits during the year.
             cash dividends per common share shown for each year in the accompanying statements of operations represent dividends approved as applicable to
             the respective year.
             net income is adjusted by deducting bonuses paid to directors as well as the payment of dividends to shareholders of preferred stocks to be
             recognized as an appropriation of retained earnings, and the calculation of net income per share is made on that adjusted net income basis.

h. cash and cash equivalents
   cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows are comprised of cash in hand, bank deposits able to be withdrawn on
   demand, and marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less and which represent a minor risk of fluctuation in value.

i. marketable securities and investment securities
   equity securities classified as “other securities” (available-for-sale securities) for which market quotations are available, are stated at fair market
   value. net unrealized gains or losses on these securities are reported as a separate item in “net assets” at a net-of-tax amount. equity and debt
   securities classified as “other securities” (available -for-sale-securities) for which market quotations are not available, are stated at amortized cost or
   acquisition cost calculated using the weighted average method.

j. derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
   in accordance with the “accounting standard for financial instruments” and the “guidelines for accounting for financial instruments”, gains or
   losses arising from changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements, forward exchange contracts and currency swap contracts designated as
   “hedging instruments” are carried until the profits and losses on the hedged items or transactions are recognized.
   in addition, net cash flows from interest rate swap agreements which meet certain criteria under the accounting standard, are offset against or added
   to the interest arising from the hedged interest-bearing debt.
   in addition, designation (“furiate-shori”) is applied to forward exchange contracts and currency swap contracts designated as hedging
   instruments under certain criteria.
   derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to market, and the unrealized gains or losses on the derivative instruments
   are charged or credited to current earnings.

k. allowance for doubtful accounts
   an allowance for doubtful accounts is generally provided at an amount calculated using the bad debt loss ratio, primarily based on past experience,
   plus the estimated uncollectible amount of specific receivables.

l. inventories
   real estates held for sale are stated at cost, determined using the specific cost method and the real estate held for sale with lower profitability are
   written down for the purpose of reporting on the balance sheet. other inventories are stated at cost, determined using the first-in first-out method
   and other inventories with lower profitability are written down for the purpose of reporting on the balance sheet

m. depreciation and amortization
   tangible fixed assets (excluding lease assets):
   vessels, property and equipment, including significant capital expenditures and additions, are stated at cost. maintenance and repairs are charged to
   income as incurred.
   depreciation of vessels is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as designated by the japanese income
   tax laws. depreciation of buildings (except for those acquired on or after april 1, 1998; excluding building fixtures) and other equipment is
   computed using the declining-balance method. depreciation of buildings acquired on or after april 1, 1998 is computed using the straight-line
   method in accordance with the revision of the japanese income tax law in 1998.
   intangible fixed assets (excluding lease assets):
   amortization of intangible assets is primarily computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as designated by
   the japanese income tax laws. software for internal use are depreciated using the straight-line method over the period of estimated use (5 years).
                                                                                                                                                                         financial review




   lease assets:
   finance lease transactions that transfer the ownership are capitalized and accounted for as ordinary sales transactions.
   finance lease transactions that do not transfer the ownership are capitalized and depreciated by using the straight-line method over the lease term of
   the assets with no residual value.
   finance lease transactions that do not transfer the ownership, which commenced prior to april 1, 2008, are accounted for as ordinary lease
   transactions.

n. accrued employees’ pension and severance costs
   accrued employees’ pension and severance costs under the defined benefit plans of the companies are determined based on the actuarial present
   value of projected benefit obligations at year end, calculated by applying the plan’s benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date, and
   the fair value of plan assets at year end.




                                                                                                                                            i i n o r e p o r t 2 0 10

    o. reserve for retirement benefits to directors and statutory auditors
          a reserve for retirement benefits to directors and statutory auditors is provided for at the amount which would have been paid based on the
           companies’ internal policies, if all eligible directors and statutory auditors had retired at the balance sheet date.
          effective from the shareholders' meeting of the company, held on june 28, 2006, the company abolished the retirement benefit plan for directors
          and statutory auditors. accordingly, the company recognized the liabilities for retirement benefit for directors and statutory auditors until the
          shareholders’ meeting on june 28, 2006, which would be paid up on their retirement, as other non-current liabilities.

    p. reserve for periodic overhaul of vessels
          under japanese law, the vessels of the companies are subject to periodic overhaul. japanese law requires that vessels be overhauled every five years.
          the companies provide for the estimated cost of the future periodic overhaul of vessels.

    q. appropriation of retained earnings
          the corporation law of japan provides that an amount equal to 10% of distribution of surplus (aggregate of capital surplus and retained earnings)
          must be appropriated as a legal reserve or as additional paid-in capital depending on which surplus is distributed, until the total of such reserve and
          additional paid-in capital equals 25% of common stock.



3. cash and cash equivalents
    cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows as of march 31, 2010 and 2009 were comprised of the following:


                                                                                                                      millions of yen

    the book values of cash and time deposits, notes and accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings are deemed as their fair
    values since there should not be significant amounts of differences between the book values and fair values. available-for-sale securities are measured at
    fair value based on the market quotations. the fair value of long-term borrowings is based on the discounted cash flow of its interests and
    principals by incremental borrowing rate.

6. derivative financial instruments
    in the normal course of business, the companies employ forward exchange contracts to manage their exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign
    exchange rates in respect of receivables and payables. in addition, the companies use interest rate swap agreements to limit their exposure to loss in
    relation to underlying debt resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. the companies do not use derivatives for speculative or trading
    purposes.
    there are no derivative instruments outstanding to which hedge accounting is not applied.

message from the former president



the iino group has always viewed safety as an               continue to work as one to meet your expectations, and
important management issue. to us, the word “safety”        we look forward to your continued support.
implies two ideals.
one is the desire to avoid ever being the cause of a        in conclusion, i would like to express my gratitude to
major accident. for example, if crude oil carried by our    everyone from outside the iino group who contributed
oil tankers or hazardous materials transported by our       to this report and to all of its readers.
chemical tankers were to leak into the ocean, it would
dramatically impact the natural environment.
the second is the desire to avoid being caught up in
dangerous situations. the iino group’s vessels still risk
encountering piracy on the waters they travel.
moreover, some of our vessels may encounter
unavoidable situations even if the most careful
precautions are taken. they could be nudged, or worse,
by another vessel while anchored, for example. we
must always exercise caution and never forget to
prepare for danger. nevertheless, some situations are
unpredictable and unavoidable even with such
precautions. i pray that our entire fleet never
encounters such situations and always enjoys safe
voyages.
looking back, my life in the shipping business began
with a small company immediately after the
consolidation of japan’s shipping industry, and i grew
in step with the company’s subsequent growth. in
retrospect, shipping industry consolidation also brought
home the importance of standing on your own two feet
and widespread concern for safety, which combined to
give rise to a corporate culture that values long-term
stability and independence. perhaps this background is
why iino has long been regarded as having sound
management.
our culture is also manifest in our unique corporate
strategy, comprising a tenacious investment strategy
focused on long-term results and investment in the real
estate business as a source of stable earnings. one
pertinent example is our chemical tanker division,
which was launched in 1979 and is currently one of our
mainstay areas. after more than twenty difficult years,
the division finally began yielding tangible earnings
upon the turn of the millennium. this kind of
entrepreneurial spirit within the company has been
handed down through the years, culminating in the iino
                                                                                 executive adviser
group as it exists today. looking ahead, we hope to
