in this section, president kudo discusses progress towards curbing fluctuation risk and generating stable earnings—
key tasks of the medium-term management plan.


1. curbing fluctuation risk
the nyk group’s measures to curb fluctuation risk were successful
and improved profitability dramatically.

2. generating stable earnings
through the effective use of such assets as personnel and vessels,
the nyk group steadily accumulated long-term contracts.

legislative measures or social expectations for environmental
preservation, including the prevention of global warming,
atmospheric pollution, and the preservation of biodiversity, as
well as safety and security, could affect the operating perfor-
mance and financial condition of the nyk group. in the event
that compliance with legislation or other regulations in certain
regions becomes problematic, this situation could limit the
nyk group’s operations in that region, which could impact the
group’s operating performance.

management’s report on internal control over
financial reporting


1. matters relating to the basic framework of internal control over financial reporting
yasumi kudo, president, president corporate officer, and kenji mizushima, representative director, senior managing corporate
officer, are responsible for designing and operating effective internal control over financial reporting of the company and have
designed and operated internal control over financial reporting of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
basic framework for internal control set forth in “on the setting of the standards and practice standards for management
assessment and audit concerning internal control over financial reporting (council opinions)” published by the business
accounting council.
   the internal control is designed to achieve its objectives to the extent reasonable through the effective function and combination
of its basic elements. therefore, there is a possibility that material misstatements may not be completely prevented or detected by
internal control over financial reporting.


2. matters relating to the scope of assessment, the basis date of assessment and the assessment procedures
the assessment of internal control over financial reporting was performed as of march 31, 2013, which is the end of this fiscal year.
the assessment was performed in accordance with assessment standards for internal control over financial reporting generally
accepted in japan.
   in conducting this assessment, we evaluated internal controls which may have a material effect on our entire financial reporting
on a consolidated basis (“company-level controls”) and based on the results of this assessment, we selected business processes
to be tested. we analyzed these selected business processes, identified key controls that may have a material impact on the
reliability of the company’s financial reporting, and assessed the design and operation of these key controls. these procedures
have allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of the internal controls of the company.
   we determined the required scope of assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the company, as well as its
consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliated companies, from the perspective of the materiality that may affect the reli-
ability of their financial reporting. the materiality that may affect the reliability of the financial reporting is determined taking into
account the materiality of quantitative and qualitative impacts on financial reporting. in light of the results of assessment of compa-
ny-level controls conducted for the company and consolidated subsidiaries, we reasonably determined the scope of assessment of
process-level controls. regarding the consolidated subsidiaries and the equity-method affiliated companies that do not have a
material effect on financial reporting, we did not include them in the scope of assessment of company-level controls.
   regarding the scope of assessment of process-level controls, we selected locations and business units to be tested in de-
scending order of revenues, and the companies whose combined revenues reaches two thirds of revenues on a consolidated basis
were selected as “significant locations and/or business units”. we included in the scope of assessment, at the selected significant
locations and/or business units, business processes leading to revenues, costs and expenses, accounts receivable-trade, and fixed
assets as significant accounts that may have a material impact on the business objectives of the company. further, in addition to
selected significant locations and/or business units, we also selected for testing the business processes having greater materiality,

                                                                                                                                                   facts and figures
taking into account their impact on the financial reporting.


3. matters relating to the results of the assessment
as a result of the assessment described above, as of the end of this fiscal year, we concluded that the company’s internal control
over financial reporting of the consolidated financial statements was effectively maintained.

                    independent auditor’s report

                    to the board of directors of nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha:

                    report on the consolidated financial statements
                    we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha and its consolidated subsidiaries
                    as of march 31, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash
                    flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, all expressed in
                    japanese yen.
                    management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
                    management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with
                    accounting principles generally accepted in japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable
                    the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
                    auditor’s responsibility
                    our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. we conducted our audit in
                    accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in japan. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
                    reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
                    an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
                    statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstate-
                    ment of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
                    internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit
                    procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
                    entity’s internal control. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
                    accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
                    we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
                    opinion
                    in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
                    position of nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha and its consolidated subsidiaries as of march 31, 2013, and the consolidated results of
                    their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in japan.
                    convenience translation
                    our audit also comprehended the translation of japanese yen amounts into u.s. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation
                    has been made in accordance with the basis stated in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. such u.s. dollar amounts are
                    presented solely for the convenience of readers outside japan.
                    report on internal control
                    we have audited management’s report on internal control over financial reporting of the consolidated financial statements of nippon
                    yusen kabushiki kaisha as of march 31, 2013.
                    management’s responsibility for report on internal control
                    management is responsible for designing and operating effective internal control over financial reporting and for the preparation and
                    fair presentation of its report on internal control in accordance with assessment standards for internal control over financial reporting
                    generally accepted in japan. there is a possibility that misstatements may not be completely prevented or detected by internal control
                    over financial reporting.

                    control audit in accordance with auditing standards for internal control over financial reporting generally accepted in japan. those

                    control is free from material misstatement.
                    an internal control audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the results of the assessment of internal control
                    over financial reporting in management’s report on internal control. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
                    including the significance of effects on reliability of financial reporting. an internal control audit includes examining representations on
                    the scope, procedures and results of the assessment of internal control over financial reporting made by management, as well as
                    evaluating the overall presentation of management’s report on internal control.
                    we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

environmental accounting



the basic concept behind our environmental accounting is to correctly capture the expenses required for the protection
of the environment and repeatedly review our findings so that we can engage in appropriate environmental conservation
as a part of our business activities.

    fiscal 2012 overview
as in fiscal 2011, the group focused efforts on developing innovative new technologies and advancing environmental protection activities. however,
costs decreased year on year because fewer vessels went into service in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 and installation costs for environmental
technologies that help prevent global warming and air pollution were lower.
