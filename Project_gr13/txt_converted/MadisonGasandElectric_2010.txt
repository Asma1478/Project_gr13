bility to aggressively prevent pollution, minimize waste and
improve the environment. along with that charge comes the
need to balance affordable, reliable energy for customers
and maintain financial strength for investors.

as an industry leader and your community energy company, we
are well-positioned to take on this challenge. our careful plan-
ning and decision-making, innovative approaches and respon-

    taking a proactive environmental approach
    mge is dedicated to the area and its people—and that means
    doing our part to ensure a sustainable future. each day, we
    strive to go above and beyond in our efforts to balance cus-
    tomers’ needs for reliable, affordable energy with our
    commitment to be responsible environmental stewards.

    our environmental management system (ems) helps guide our
    efforts. we voluntarily implemented this framework, updated
    it in 2004 and continue to use it to enhance our environmental
    performance. our ems builds environmental accountability
    into our daily operations by establishing annual goals and
    measuring performance with audits reviewed by senior
    management.

    meeting energy 2015 goals early
    energy 2015 is mge’s strategic, multiyear plan to ensure a
    balanced and reliable energy supply and to reduce emissions.
    under energy 2015, mge’s carbon dioxide (co2) impacts are
    projected to decline—a 21% decrease for total co2 emis-
    sions and a 17% decrease for co2 rates from 2005 to 2015
    (see page 10).

    mge is meeting the environmental goals set in the energy
    2015 plan—meeting many goals earlier than planned. mge
    committed to:
         discontinue burning coal at blount generating station       for the second consecutive year, mge’s

                                  a switch to new equipment powered by natural gas increased the efficiency
                                  by about 50%. for even greater performance, mge recommended a con-

                                  director at university research park.

                                  “mge staffers bring an unbiased third-party perspective when it comes
                                  to analysis and recommendations. they have the technical expertise to
                                  guide you through the process and help you understand exactly what your
                                  choices are and the benefits of different options,” hyer said. “it’s been a
                                  great partnership.”

    improving the performance of our generation fleet
    over the last decade, mge has steadily modernized its generation
    fleet to increase efficiencies and reduce air emissions. this has
    included state-of-the-art, new coal-fired generating units, switching
    some generation from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas and bring-
    ing more renewable energy online (see page 8).

    in 2010, we began receiving energy from the new cleaner coal
    generating facility at elm road in oak creek. unit 1 came online in
    february, and unit 2 is due online this fall. electricity from this efficient,
    world-class plant will allow mge to stop burning coal at its much older,         in 2005, we brought the west campus

road plant was constructed with state-of-the-art mercury controls—
providing a mercury-removal rate greater than 90%.

at the columbia plant, which has two coal-fired 500-megawatt (mw)

and began operating on one of the units in january of this year. data
shows mercury reduction of at least 70% from the new equipment.

    growing renewable energy
    mge continues to be an industry leader taking new steps with
    renewable energy. we exceed our current renewable portfolio
    standard requirements and already surpass the 2015 require-
    ment set by the state of wisconsin.

    in 2009, mge delivered more than 375,800 megawatt-hours
    of renewable energy to customers. this includes energy pro-
    duced from solar, methane gas and wind.

    solar
    mge works to develop solar installations in the community by:

            installing our own systems. mge owns, operates,
            maintains or helps maintain more than 20 photovol-
            taic (pv) systems, including 10 systems on area high
            schools.
            using an innovative program to encourage customer
            participation.

    mge expanded its clean power partners program to encour-            mge is nationally recognized for its wind
                                                                        energy efforts. the company receives
    age homeowners and businesses to install solar pv systems
                                                                        more than 10% of its energy from

    increased the amount of solar generation in the program
    more than three times—from 300 kilowatts to 1 megawatt (mw)
    in 2009. the solar energy is part of mge’s overall green pricing
    program.

    pv systems are expensive to purchase and install. clean power
    partners helps address that expense and make it more feasible
    for businesses and residents to invest in solar energy. since the
    program began in 2008, customers have installed more than
    100 solar units.

    as a result of these efforts, mge recently was ranked #4 in the
    central u.s. region for annual total solar watts per customer by
    the solar electric power association.

    methane gas
    landfills produce methane gas, which is a greenhouse gas that
    is 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide (co2). methane
    would typically be burned off into the atmosphere, but it can
    be captured and used as fuel. since 2001, we have purchased         mge owns and operates solar systems to

wind energy
mge currently owns two wind farms and purchases wind power                     mge wind capacity
from independent projects. we have grown our wind capacity
from an 11-mw wind farm that we built in 1999 to our present
wind capacity of 137 mw. part of this wind energy is mandated                                  137 mw
by state law and goes into our overall electric mix for customers.
the remaining wind energy is above and beyond that mandated
amount and supplies our green power tomorrow program.

green power tomorrow
mge challenges customers to increase their commitment to
conservation with its green pricing program. we expanded
green power tomorrow in 2008, and by the end of 2009, the
number of customers in the program increased 160%.

green power tomorrow gives customers the option to purchase
clean energy by paying a little extra on their monthly electric
bills. in 2009, green power participants saved more than                           11 mw
172,000 tons of co2 and other air emissions.

green power tomorrow received the 2009 utility green power pro-                    1999          2009
gram of the year award from the u.s. department of energy and the
environmental protection agency. it recognizes mge for expanding
its wind power program.


  customers value renewable energy opportunities

  more than 200 business customers participate in green power
  tomorrow and are featured on mge.com/marketplace. they find
  value in green energy:

      “being green is what it’s all about. we want to feel better
      about what we do and set an example for the industry. using
      green energy is a key piece of the puzzle—it costs a bit more,
      but the positive impact it can have makes it worthwhile.”
      --ole olson, isthmus engineering & manufacturing cooperative

      “the green power tomorrow program shows our dedication to our community and is a simple way for
      consumers to support renewable energy just by doing everyday shopping. it’s a way for us to lead by
      example and to show that every bit of green power can make a difference.” --tim metcalfe, metcalfe’s market

      “we are pleased to be part of mge’s green power tomorrow program. protecting the earth is a value we want
      the children to grow up with, and supporting renewable energy is a great way to help teach that lesson.”

     federal regulations
     the environmental protection agency (epa) has begun issuing
     regulations to reduce ghgs. the epa decided that the main ghgs
     are covered under the clean air act. as a result, the epa intends to
     include ghgs under environmental permitting guidelines in 2011.
     the epa rules cover:
             carbon dioxide.             hydrofluorocarbons.                         2005           2015

vehicle idling policy
mge implemented a new vehicle idling policy that directs
employees to turn off company vehicles and equipment when
not in use. this practice helps:
    reduce air emissions. idling vehicles release nitrogen
    oxides, volatile organics and greenhouse gases.
    burn less fuel. national studies show diesel- and
    gasoline-powered vehicles can use fuel at the rate of
    up to one gallon per hour when idling.
     minimize wear and tear on engines.

prairie restoration
mge participates in a prairie restoration effort with the city
of madison and wisconsin & southern railroad. the project
includes establishing prairie plantings along the capital city      a team of mge employees developed the
trail and railroad tracks from south blair street to south          vehicle idling policy, which is tailored to
                                                                    mge’s operations. it limits idling to no

then reseeding those areas. a controlled prairie burn and
additional seeding took place this year.

prairie restoration increases plant diversity, which attracts
native, beneficial insects and other wildlife. increased plant
diversity provides more nutrients to the soil than monoculture
plantings such as turf grass.

in addition, prairie grasses have deeper root systems, which
aid in water infiltration and retention. they also cut down on
surface water runoff and erosion, which can be a problem in
urban areas. pollutants that run off into prairie plantings are
removed before water enters groundwater or lakes and streams.
prairie grasses also eliminate or reduce reliance on mowing,
which decreases fossil fuel use and associated air pollution.

adopt-a-highway
mge participates in wisconsin’s adopt-a-highway program.
                       volunteers pick up litter along a two-mile
                       stretch of state highway. this annual
                       project is part of mge’s commitment
                       to the environment.

     enhancing operations
     mge continues to green up its operations with environmentally
     friendly improvements to its facilities and transportation fleet.

     facility improvements
     a major energy efficiency/sustainability project that began in 2009
     is yielding significant results. mge has been upgrading lighting
     and equipment—ranging from its offices to its fleet garage.

     improvements at mge’s general office facility already have
     saved 50,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. this includes upgrad-
     ing the building automation and lighting systems. lighting
     upgrades included retrofitting numerous lights and controls,
     removing unneeded units and installing occupancy sensors.

     projects at other company buildings have cut energy use by
     up to 26%. these efforts include lighting upgrades and occu-
     pancy sensor installations. additional projects are under way         mge uses 100% renewable energy for its

     hybrid utility trucks: mge added two hybrid line-and-pole trucks
     to its fleet this year. typical bucket trucks require power from an
     idling engine to operate an aerial lift. with mge’s new trucks, a
     hybrid component operates the aerial lift bucket. a vehicle that
     can operate its bucket mechanism without idling wastes no fuel
     and emits no pollutants.

     mge is testing the feasibility of these vehicles for daily use in
     the field. studies suggest commercial hybrid vehicles could
     improve fuel economy by 20% in addition to reducing green-
     house gas emissions and smog-forming pollutants.

     electric facilities vehicle: mge’s facilities department uses a
     small but rugged electric vehicle that has a half-ton hauling
     capacity and can travel 30 to 40 miles between charges.

     passenger-vehicle hybrids: mge’s hybrid fleet includes more
     than 20 passenger vehicles:
             18 ford escape hybrids.
             one ford escape plug-in hybrid.
             one toyota prius plug-in hybrid.
             one chevrolet silverado hybrid truck.                         when properly charged, a hybrid bucket

     testing technology
     mge has a solid track record of developing technology demon-
     stration projects to learn about renewable energy sources and
     ways to help our environment.

     solar projects
     state capitol: mge purchased and installed 48 solar photovol-
     taic panels on the west wing roof of the state capitol. the
     10-kilowatt system is about twice the size of a typical resi-
     dential solar system. the power generated feeds into mge’s
     electric grid. this demonstration project prevents 12 tons of
     carbon dioxide emissions annually.

     madison children’s museum: mge recently installed a solar
     demonstration project on the rooftop garden of the new madison
     children’s museum (mcm). it includes 14 flexible laminate pan-
     els that are applied directly to the roof. this solar system will
     produce about 1,600 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually.

                                             museum visitors can check

     led/solar lighting demonstration: mge recently provided solar-
     powered lights along a pathway in madison’s thut park. the
     system features 2-foot by 3.5-foot solar panels that sit atop
     five light poles. four of the lights are located along the path
     and a fifth sits at the edge of the park to help light a dark area
     of the neighborhood.

     during the day, the solar units take sunlight, convert it to electric-
     ity and store it in a battery. at night, that electricity is used to turn
     on the new, energy-efficient led (light-emitting diode) lights. the

sixteen neighborhoods across mge’s service territory participated in the green power challenge. these neighborhoods
include 22,000 residential households and 2,200 businesses.


engaging neighborhoods
mge held a green power challenge for madison neighborhood
associations. the goal was for each association to encourage
residents and businesses in their neighborhood to go beyond
current levels of green power participation. the two neighbor-
hoods with the greatest increase in green power participation
over the nine-month contest period received cash prizes.

this challenge created an opportunity to reach many people
and encourage them to make smart choices about energy. it
also allowed mge to strengthen relationships with the 16 par-
ticipating neighborhoods. several neighborhood associations
took a proactive approach by distributing green power materi-
als at community events, signing up people at community
meetings and making plans to go door to door to encourage
participation.

earth day education
mge took part in several events this spring to help celebrate the
40th anniversary of earth day and teach community members
about reducing their environmental footprint. mge set up
displays, made presentations and sponsored an educational
newspaper insert.

we also launched a web site section: earth day every day at
mge.com/earthday. this resource features learning activities for             mge discussed renewable energy with
