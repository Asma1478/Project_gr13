key performance indicators (kpis)
in order to realise its strategic aims, paypoint has identified areas of strategic focus and has put in place a number of kpis to measure
progress against them. whilst these kpis are helpful in measuring the group’s performance, they are not exhaustive and the group
uses many other measures to monitor progress.

3. collect+ revenue and net revenue is included in developing business stream’s revenue and net revenue, but as collect+ is reported in the consolidated income
   statement on a profit before tax only basis, revenue and net revenue needs to be eliminated to reconcile to reported revenue and net revenue.
4. net revenue is revenue less the cost of mobile top-ups and sim cards where paypoint is principal and costs incurred by paypoint which are recharged to clients and
   merchants. these costs include retail agent commission, merchant service charges levied by card scheme sponsors and costs for the provision of call centres for
   paybyphone clients.

1. in ireland and romania, paypoint is principal in the sale of mobile top-ups and, accordingly, the face value of the top-up is included in sales and the corresponding
   costs in cost of sales.
2. net revenue is revenue less the cost of mobile top-ups and sim cards where paypoint is principal and costs incurred by paypoint which are recharged to clients and
   merchants. these costs include retail agent commission, merchant service charges levied by card scheme sponsors and costs for the provision of call centres for
   paybyphone clients.
3. operating margin is calculated as operating profit, including our share of collect+ losses, as a percentage of net revenue.

details of the company’s strategy are included in the chief
executive’s review on page 3. the company’s approach to
corporate social responsibility and an analysis of risks facing
the company is set out in separate statements on pages 12
and 15 respectively.

economic climate
the company’s bill and general payments sector, which accounts
for 41% (2010: 43%) of our net revenue, has continued to
be resilient, as consumers’ discretion in expenditure is limited
for essential services and our service continues to be popular.
utility providers in the uk continue to install new prepay gas
and electricity meters, which will have a beneficial impact on our
transaction volumes. the internet payment market continues
to grow substantially. there has been an adverse impact on
our mobile top-ups as mobile operators continue to offer more
airtime at lower cost in the uk and to promote prepay less than
contract. paybyphone is able to offer parking authorities a more
cost effective collection system for parking compared to pay and
display machines. this has led to an increase in the number
of tenders being issued as parking authorities try to reduce
their costs.

probability and seriousness of the risk, it may not be possible to avoid the crystallisation of some or all of such risks. the group’s risk

short and long-term incentives are structured so as to align
directors’ interests with those of shareholders by rewarding
them for enhancing shareholder value. it should be noted
that the real value received by the executive directors under
the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the
degree to which the associated performance conditions have
been satisfied at the end of the three year performance period
and the share price of the company at this time. this ensures
that substantial rewards are only received when value has been
created in the business.

50           paypoint plc annual report 2011

                    notes to the notice of annual general meeting
1.   a form of proxy is enclosed with this notice for use by shareholders. to be valid, a proxy must be received by the company’s
     registrars, capita registrars, pxs, 34 beckenham road, beckenham, kent br3 4tu not less than 48 hours before the time of the
     annual general meeting. appointment of a proxy does not preclude a shareholder from attending the annual general meeting
     and voting in person.

2.   a member entitled to attend, speak and vote at the annual general meeting may appoint one or more proxies (who need not be
     a member of the company) to attend and, on a poll, to vote on his or her behalf. in order to be valid, an appointment of proxy
     must be returned by one of the following methods:

     •   in hard copy form by post, by courier or by hand to the company’s registrars, capita registrars, pxs, 34 beckenham road,
         beckenham, kent br3 4tu; or
     • in the case of crest members, by utilising the crest electronic proxy appointment service in accordance with the
         procedures set out below,
     and in each case must be received by the company not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.

3.   any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the companies act 2006 to enjoy
     information rights (a “nominated person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she
     was nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the annual general meeting.
     if a nominated person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such
     agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.

4.   the statement of the rights of shareholders to appoint a proxy in paragraphs one and two above does not apply to nominated
     persons. the rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by shareholders of the company.

5.   crest members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the crest electronic proxy appointment service may do so
     for the annual general meeting and any adjournment thereof by using the procedures described in the crest manual. crest
     personal members or other crest sponsored members, and those crest members who have appointed a voting service
     provider(s) should refer to their crest sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action
     on their behalf. in order for a proxy appointment, or instruction, made by means of crest to be valid, the appropriate crest
     message (a crest proxy instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with euroclear uk & ireland limited’s (eui)
     specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the crest manual. the message,
     regardless of whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously
     appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (id ra10) by the latest
     time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of annual general meeting. for this purpose, the time of receipt
     will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the crest applications host) from
     which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to crest in the manner prescribed by crest. the company
     may treat as invalid a crest proxy instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation 35(5) of the uncertificated securities
     regulations 2001. crest members and, where applicable, their crest sponsors or voting service providers should note that
     eui does not make available special procedure in crest for any particular messages. normal system timings and limitations
     will therefore apply in relation to the input of crest proxy instructions. it is therefore the responsibility of the crest member
     concerned to take (or, if the crest member is a crest personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting
     service provider(s), to procure that his/her crest sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to
     ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the crest system by any particular time. in this connection, crest members
     and, where applicable, their crest sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the crest
     manual concerning practical limitations of the crest system and timings.

6.   to be entitled to attend and vote at the annual general meeting or any adjournment thereof (and also for the purpose of
     calculating how many votes a person may cast), a person must have his/her name entered on the register of members of the
     company by 6 pm on 13 july 2011 (or 6 pm on the date being two days before any adjourned meeting). changes to entries on
     the register of members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at
     the meeting.

7.   biographical details of the directors of the company are shown on page 19 of the 2011 annual report.

8.   each member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting
     which, in accordance with section 319a of the companies act 2006 and subject to some exceptions, the company must cause
     to be answered. however, no such answer need be given if:

     (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the
          disclosure of confidential information;
     (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question;
          or
     (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.




                                                                                                paypoint plc annual report 2011               51

9.   information relating to the meeting which the company is required by the companies act 2006 to publish on a website in
     advance of the meeting may be viewed at www.paypoint.com. a member may not use any electronic address provided by the
     company in this document or with any proxy appointment form or in any website for communicating with the company for any
     purpose in relation to the meeting other than as expressly stated in it.

10. it is possible that, pursuant to members’ requests made in accordance with section 527 of the companies act 2006, the

recommendation and voting intentions

with respect to resolutions 4 to 12 (inclusive), the board has considered the retiring directors’ performance and recommends
that each director be proposed for re-election. this opinion is based on an assessment of each director’s relevant knowledge and
experience and the conclusion that, in each case, their informed opinions are of significant value and contribute greatly to board
discussions. the directors’ biographies can be found on page 19 of the 2011 annual report.

the directors consider that all the resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the company and its shareholders
as a whole and most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of those shareholders. those directors who are
shareholders will be voting in favour of the resolutions and unanimously recommend that you do so as well.

                       explanatory notes to certain of the resolutions to be
                            proposed at the annual general meeting
resolution 15: directors’ authority to allot shares

by virtue of section 551 of the companies act 2006 (the act), the directors require the authority of shareholders of the company
to allot shares or other relevant securities. the resolution numbered 15 authorises the directors to make allotments of up to an
additional 25,585,993 ordinary shares (representing approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the company (excluding
treasury shares) as at the date of this document). this amount is in line with abi guidelines. if approved at the forthcoming annual
general meeting, the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which the resolution is passed or on the
conclusion of the annual general meeting of the company to be held in 2012, whichever is the sooner. the directors have no present
intention of exercising the authority proposed to be conferred pursuant to resolution 15.

resolution 16: authority for disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights

by virtue of section 561 of the act, any issue by the company of equity capital for cash made otherwise than to existing shareholders
on a proportional basis requires the consent of shareholders of the company unless the company has obtained their authority under
section 570 of the act. the resolution numbered 16 is for that purpose. it authorises the directors to allot shares by way of rights
issue or pursuant to an open offer or otherwise than strictly pro rata when the directors consider that it is expedient to do so and
also allows them to issue for cash up to 3,387,899 ordinary shares (representing approximately five per cent) of the issued share
capital of the company (excluding treasury shares) as at the date of this document other than on a pre-emptive basis. if approved at
the forthcoming annual general meeting, the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which the resolution is
passed or on the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the company to be held in 2012, whichever is the sooner.

resolution 17: authority to make market purchases of ordinary shares.

by virtue of section 701 of the act, the company may make market purchases of its own ordinary shares if authorised to do so by
shareholders. under resolution 17, the directors seek to renew an annual authority to make market purchases of shares: each year
the directors will seek to further renew this authority at the company’s annual general meeting. any ordinary shares purchased under
this authority would either be:

(i)     cancelled immediately on completion of the purchase and the number of ordinary shares in issue reduced accordingly;
(ii)    held, sold, transferred or otherwise dealt with as treasury shares in accordance with the provisions of the act; or
(iii)   transferred to an employee benefit trust for the satisfaction of awards under the company’s existing share schemes.

the maximum number of ordinary shares which could be purchased pursuant to this authority is 10,156,921, being 14.99 per
cent of the issued share capital of the company (excluding treasury shares) as at the date of this document. any repurchase of
ordinary shares carried out by the company would be at a maximum price per ordinary share of 105 per cent of the average middle
market price of such a share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase, the price equal to the last
independent trade or the highest current independent bid and at a minimum price equal to the nominal value. the authority to
repurchase ordinary shares will, if approved by shareholders, only be exercised after careful consideration by the directors and if
such exercise would result in an increase in earnings per share and be in the best interests of shareholders generally. if approved at
the forthcoming annual general meeting, the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which the resolution is
passed, or on the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the company to be held in 2012, whichever is the sooner.

resolution 18: authority to allow any general meeting of the company that is not an annual general meeting to be called on not less
than 14 clear days’ notice.

further to the implementation of the shareholder rights regulations, the directors seek authority to hold general meetings, other
than annual general meetings, on 14 rather than 21 days notice. if approved at the forthcoming annual general meeting, the
authority will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which the resolution is passed, or on the conclusion of the annual
general meeting of the company to be held in 2012, whichever is the sooner.

explanatory notes
1. every holder has the right to appoint some other person(s) of their choice, who need not be a shareholder as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights, to attend, speak and
   vote on their behalf at the meeting. if you wish to appoint a person other than the chairman, please insert the name of your chosen proxy holder in the space provided (see
   below). if the proxy is being appointed in relation to less than your full voting entitlement, please enter in the space beneath the proxy holder’s name (see above) the number
   of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy. if left blank, your proxy will be deemed to be authorised in respect of your full voting entitlement (or if this
   proxy form has been issued in respect of a designated account for a shareholder, the full voting entitlement for that designated account).
2. to appoint more than one proxy, you may photocopy this form. please indicate the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to
   act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you). please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being
   given. all forms must be signed and should be returned together in the same envelope.
3. the right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have been nominated to receive communication from
   the company in accordance with section 146 of the companies act 2006 (nominated persons). nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered
   shareholder who holds shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. alternatively, if nominated persons do not have such a right, or
   do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
4. the vote withheld option above is provided to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution. however, it should be noted that a vote withheld is not a vote in law and will
   not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of the votes for and against a resolution.
5. entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting and the number of votes which may be cast thereat will be determined by reference to the register of members of the company
   at 6pm on the day which is two days before the day of the meeting or adjourned meeting. changes to entries on the register of members after that time shall be disregarded
   in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
6. to appoint one or more proxies or to give an instruction to a proxy (whether previously appointed or otherwise) via the crest system, crest messages must be received by
   the issuer’s agent (id number ra10) not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting. for this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time
   (as determined by the timestamp generated by the crest system) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message. the company may treat as invalid a proxy
   appointment sent by crest in the circumstances set out in regulation 35(5)(a) of the uncertificated securities regulations 2001.
7. the completion and return of this form will not preclude a member from attending the meeting and voting in person. if you attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointment
   will automatically be terminated.
8. to be effective, all votes must be lodged not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting at the office of the company’s registrars at: capita registrars, pxs, 34 beckenham
   road, beckenham, kent, br3 4tu.

   account holders; or (ii) uniquely designated accounts. the company and capita registrars accept no liability for any instruction that does not comply with these conditions.
