a message from aetna’s chairman
building a healthier world: it’s a mission aetna proudly pursues every day. in doing so, we keep our priorities
straight — people, planet, then profit — to ensure that our work benefits people and preserves the environment,
which ultimately drives long-term business success and profitability.


aetna’s efforts to build a healthier world encompass how we treat our employees, improve the lives of customers,
and effect positive change in community health. the highlights of this work are captured in this report, which i’m
proud to share with you on behalf of aetna’s nearly 50,000 employees.


                                               our employees make our company successful, and developing and
                                               rewarding them remains a key focus. to help employees manage college
                                               debt, we launched a program that matches their student loan payments
                                               up to $10,000 for a lifetime. this program builds on earlier initiatives of our
                                               “social compact” — increasing our minimum base wage and lowering health
                                               care expenses for eligible employees – as well as our long-standing wellness
                                               programs, which emphasize mindfulness and a holistic view of health.

    improve the lives of                       opportunity through the healthiest cities & counties challenge, which
    customers and effect                       we created with the american public health association and the national
                                               association of counties. the challenge is poised to award $1.5 million
    positive change for people of
                                               in prizes to communities that show improvements in healthy behaviors,
    all kinds.
                                               community safety, built environment and other factors.


to get a better understanding of communities across the country, we also collaborated with u.s. news & world
report to develop the inaugural healthiest communities rankings. this new platform evaluates communities
across 10 categories — from education and population health to infrastructure and economy — to assess which
communities offer their citizens the greatest opportunity to live a productive, healthy life. our goal in creating
these rankings is not just to recognize communities that are already making significant progress toward building
healthy communities, but also to inspire change in the way communities think about and pursue improvements in
public health. while no two communities are the same, all communities can learn about best practices in their own
backyard and across the country, then apply these lessons to improve the health of their residents.


when communities are in crisis, aetna and its people also take concerted action. we responded to 2017’s
unprecedented series of natural disasters with financial donations and employee volunteers. similarly, in response
to the opioid crisis, we developed collaborations with hard-hit states to fund vital prevention and treatment
programs. this is in addition to our ongoing efforts to build healthier communities.


aetna is proud to partner with our communities, members and customers, and employees to create a healthier
world, one person at a time.

we also are committed to helping communities stay healthy through corporate philanthropy. at the core of this
work is the aetna foundation, dedicated to promoting wellness, health and access to high-quality health care for
everyone. the aetna foundation partners with community-based leaders and organizations that are working on
solutions that address the social determinants of health — the factors that impact wellness outside of the doctor’s
office.

      corporate social responsibility

     as aetna pursues its goal of building healthier communities,
      we view social responsibility as a critical driver of success
         and an integral part of how we conduct our business.
one example of this integrated approach to corporate responsibility is our social compact with employees, which
launched in january 2015. this initiative increased our u.s. minimum base wage to $16 per hour, which at the time
of the announcement represented an 11 percent increase, on average, and benefited about 5,700 employees.
along with this wage increase, we announced an enhanced medical benefits program (which went into effect in
2016) to help lower out-of-pocket health care expenses for some of our u.s. employees.


in 2017, we expanded on this social compact by responding to the issue of rising student debt among our
employees. our student loan repayment program provides some financial relief for employees who graduated
since december 1, 2013. aetna now matches u.s.-based employees’ student loan payments up to $2,000 per year
for a lifetime maximum of up to $10,000 for qualifying loans.


increasing the financial security of employees helps us attract and retain strong talent.


we also believe that a happier, healthier and more productive workforce is better able to provide differentiating
value to our plan members and, by extension, contribute to building healthier communities across the nation.

an important element of aetna’s mission is to help improve the health of communities across the nation. this
is why the aetna foundation, in partnership with the american public health association and the national
association of counties, launched the healthiest cities & counties challenge in 2016. this national competition
is encouraging innovations in communities that can improve the social determinants of health, including
healthy behaviors, community safety and environmental exposures. as a result of involvement in the challenge,
participants have:



                    received recognition and acknowledgement by policymakers and community leaders


                    identified new partners and attracted stronger engagement


                    played more meaningful roles in change efforts


                    activated dormant community efforts


                    leveraged additional resources




in 2017, 10 awards and 5 honorable mentions were given to finalists recognizing emerging best practices for
community health improvement (see additional information on page 47).

                   aetna’s corporate social
                   responsibility statement

as a leading health care company, aetna strives to help people stay healthy by providing guidance, information
and tools they need to achieve their personal health goals. as we pursue our business strategy, we promote
socially responsible practices nationally and internationally to further contribute to the good health of our
members and employees, and the communities where we do business.


we are committed to limiting our own environmental impact by reducing our consumption of energy and other
environmental resources, and applying sustainability principles across our real estate and business management
processes wherever possible. meanwhile, working with health care professionals across the nation, we strive to
address the waste that threatens long-term sustainability of our health care system. we have also lent our support
to larger efforts to increase the availability of high-quality health care.


through these efforts and others, aetna is helping to cultivate a healthier population and express its commitment
to nurturing a healthy environment.

                       our people, our culture

            aetna’s diverse, engaged people deliver deep insights
           into those we serve and help create better strategies to
                      improve and sustain their health.
aetna’s people — how they collaborate and innovate — are helping move our company closer to the goal of
building a healthier world, community by community. our combined strength as an organization will help us
achieve our goals faster and deliver greater value to all our stakeholders.

aetna strives to attract, engage and retain high-performing people who are passionate about improving the health
care system. this focus on talent encompasses traditionally under-represented groups such as women; people of
color; veterans; individuals with disabilities; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (lgbtq) people. we
also strive to meet the needs of a multigenerational workforce.

we’re proud that three quarters of aetna employees are women, a third are people of color, 11 percent
self-identify as lgbt and nearly 5 percent self-identify as having a disability.

additionally, millennials comprise 31 percent of aetna’s employees, which was a key driver of our new program to
provide up to $10,000 to qualified recent college graduates to help them repay education loans.

across all employee demographics, aetna provides innovative programs to achieve better health, develop
professional skills and pursue opportunities company-wide for which they’re qualified. their appreciation for these
efforts are reflected in the 75 percent engagement levels we’ve measured through both our 2016 and 2017
employee surveys, which exceed the industry norm.

       workforce diversity offers us deeper insights into those we
       serve, which helps us develop new and better strategies to
                   improve and sustain their health.
with emphasis on diversity and inclusion, we take steps to:


              build a diverse, nimble, and agile workforce by focusing on recruitment, development,
              mobility and retention across the company

              create an inclusive environment that encourages people to bring their full selves to work, to
              realize their personal potential and help the company achieve its potential

              administer aetna-wide and department-specific learning



commitment to equal opportunity
aetna’s equal employment opportunity and affirmative action policy
assures that applicants and employees are treated fairly and have
equal opportunities in all aspects of employment regardless of personal
characteristics or status.


the policy covers and complies with state and local laws that prohibit
discrimination or harassment. the policy spells out employee
responsibilities, including a requirement that employees report any
incidents of discrimination, harassment or retaliation. a process for
reporting violations is part of the policy, including the availability of a
confidential hotline to report concerns anonymously.

        in recent years, aetna has strengthened its social compact with employees by raising the minimum
        base hourly wage for its u.s. employees to $16 an hour and launching an enhanced medical
        benefits program to help lower out-of-pocket health care expenses for some of its u.s. employees.
        we believe that these steps directly benefit aetna’s members as a result of increased employee
        engagement and reduced turnover.

        in 2017, we expanded on these significant workforce investments by launching a new student loan
        repayment program to help recent college graduates reduce their education loan debt and build
        their financial stability. through the program, aetna will match employees’ u.s.-based student loan
        payments up to a lifetime maximum of $10,000 for qualifying loans.

thrive and succeed. this chart shows survey results from 2017 and 2016, with select industry norms for comparison.

through aetna’s integrated talent management approach, we provide practical tools — the talent profile and
development plan — via our integrated learning management systems (lms) to help employees manage their
professional development.


aetna is striving to become a consumer-oriented company whose mission is to build a healthier world. our
comprehensive talent development approach lets aetna’s learning professionals influence the company’s strategic
direction at all levels of the company.


we use scorecards to align individual and organizational performance goals. business and leadership scorecards
support the company’s strategic goals, each business unit’s operating goals, and each employee’s performance
goals. business objectives are shared through an enterprise-wide scorecard, segment or business unit scorecard
and individual employee scorecards. in 2017, 49,792 scorecards were created at aetna to align and track our
progress.

                      leading the way to deliver more healthy days
                       for people while ensuring our health system
                                  delivers greater value.

aetna’s dedication to building a healthier world is rooted in our day-to-day effort to improve health outcomes
among our millions of members. drawing on our core values, which place people at the center of everything we
do, we strive to maximize healthy days for our members through hard work and a collaborative culture.

our work encompasses a broad range of activities, which start with programs for millions of plan members to
empower them to improve everyday health, achieve a stronger mind-body connection, navigate the complex
health system, and manage chronic health conditions. in tandem with these programs, we aim to reshape how
health care services in the u.s. are delivered and achieve a greater focus on value and outcomes rather than visits
and procedures.

more broadly, aetna is an industry leader furthering wellness and disease prevention among large populations of
people. we draw on our long-standing insights into the needs of diverse populations of patients to create tailored
programs that help reduce inequities in health care access and outcomes across the country. often, aetna’s work
is complemented by aetna foundation initiatives that combine grants, partnerships and thought leadership to
develop long-lasting solutions for society’s most urgent health care challenges.

improving the health system by focusing on value-based care
we are a driving force behind the transition across america to emphasizing value in the delivery of health care
services. we partner with providers to build value-based models of care, which can deliver more healthy days for
people while also lowering overall costs — today and tomorrow. a focus on value also can help address persistent
cost and quality problems in the health care industry, leading to a more sustainable system.

with the value-based health care model, doctors and hospitals are paid for helping to keep people healthy — and
for improving the health of those who have chronic conditions. they achieve these goals using methods that are
evidence-based and cost-effective.

taking a more holistic look at people’s health
aetna has been a leader in championing an approach that goes beyond a simple focus on individual health care
challenges to a consideration of the whole person and how he or she interacts with the surrounding environment.


with this approach, health care professionals from an individual’s health plan — doctors, nurses, caregivers,
pharmacists and others — engage with the person in his or her community. for example, rather than deliver
medical care solely in clinical settings, the model might combine home visits from care professionals with telephone
consultations, as well as traditional office visits. this multi-disciplinary, holistic approach ensures that members are
connected with the right services in the most convenient and efficient ways.



                                       “whether that means you are being cared for by a pharmacist, primary care doctor,
                                       caregiver or some other local resource, we need to surround people with teams that
                                       can help keep them healthy, happy and at home.”

advancing health through mindfulness

aetna continually explores new ways to help make our communities healthier. such innovation is demonstrated
by our mindfulness-based wellness programs, which have been shown to reduce stress, and improve health and
productivity among participants.


mindfulness is paying attention or noting whatever is
happening in the moment with a gentle and open mind.
when people practice mindfulness at work they are better
able to respond in the moment rather than react. instead of
multitasking, they commit to doing one task at a time, making
them more effective. they can also improve the quality of their
interactions, communication and relationships, which builds
trust.


aetna has long been a pioneer in creating mindfulness-based
wellness programs that can assist in people’s personal and
professional lives. in february 2016, aetna hired its chief
mindfulness officer and formed a team to broaden the
impact of this approach. in mid-2017, aetna opened its first
mindfulness center in its hartford headquarters, a facility designed to help aetna associates learn and engage with
mindfulness and aim to change workplace culture.


since 2011, more than 13,000 aetna employees have participated in a mindfulness-based wellness program. we
have found that employees taking part in the program self-reported a reduction in stress levels by 28 percent and
gained 62 minutes of productivity per week.


as of 2017, more than 20 employer customers have embraced aetna’s mindfulness-based wellness programs to
cultivate better health among their workforces.

integrated information improves health
aetna brings together previously dispersed and disconnected medical information to help health care professionals
and patients make informed decisions that can deliver better health outcomes.

leveraging the potential of these connections, we are helping to address health issues while lowering total effective
costs through solutions such as evidence-based applications and clinical decision-support tools, which detect
potential gaps in care and help to eliminate redundancy and waste. in 2017, nearly 4.8 million “care considerations”
or clinical alerts were shared with physicians and patients, reducing medical errors and improving quality.


healthy moms, healthy children
the journey to motherhood

women who are pregnant or planning to start a family often encounter
diverse opinions and conflicting information about the right ways to go
about preparing for maternity and childbirth.


in response, aetna has stepped forward to give prospective moms
practical resources and proactive guidance. aetna’s beginning right
maternity management program provides services to members through
the spectrum of pregnancy — from the time a member starts planning a
family, through pregnancy and well after their baby is born.


we provide:

                        educational materials (in english and spanish) on prenatal care, labor and delivery, newborn
                        care and more



                        a pregnancy risk survey to help determine whether a risk for certain complications exists



                        a preterm labor program to support high-risk women



                        access to specially trained nurses for high-risk mothers-to-be

                                   in the spotlight

           activehealth outreach saves a life
           every day at aetna, thousands of employees speak with members about ways they might achieve
           their best health. but it’s not every day that we hear that our efforts saved someone’s life. case
           in point: bobby mckeehan, a member in alabama who averted a potentially catastrophic medical
           condition thanks to aetna’s multifaceted outreach efforts .


          mckeehan drives a school bus for the state of alabama. as a member of the public education
          employees’ health insurance plan (peehip), he’s been part of activehealth’s “team up for health”
          wellness plan since 2015. during a routine outreach campaign to peehip members, health coach
          logan robinson offered to help mckeehan schedule his first call with a wellness coach — and was
          pleasantly surprised to hear him explain the impact aetna’s program already had on his life.


           mckeehan said he’d received a “care consideration” letter generated
           by activehealth’s careengine® based on an analysis of key data. the
                                                                                          “i have six
           letter noted that current or former male smokers are in general at high        grandchildren,
           risk for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and then went on             and i want to
           to recommend that mckeehan, who had been a heavy smoker for 40                 see them grow
           years, be screened for the condition. activehealth also sent this letter       up,” he said.
           to mckeehan’s primary care doctor, who asked him to come in to be
           evaluated.

           after an ultrasound showed an enlarged area in his abdomen, mckeehan was referred to a vascular
           surgeon who found a 7.3 cm aortic aneurysm that demanded immediate surgery. the surgeon was
           amazed at mckeehan’s story.


           “i can’t believe you got a letter from your wellness plan telling you to get this checked out,” the
           surgeon said, noting that most often such aneurysms are only discovered after the patient has died
           due to a rupture.


           mckeehan’s surgery and recovery went well, and he remains very grateful for the activehealth
           outreach, which helped him avoid a potentially catastrophic outcome. “i have six grandchildren, and i
           want to see them grow up,” he said.


             activehealth “care considerations” are highly personalized communications generated by the
             patented careengine system, which compiles member data from a variety of sources such as
             medical and pharmacy claims, lab results and member-provided information. the careengine
             analyzes this information against evidence-based medicine to identify potential gaps in care,
             quality issues and opportunities to improve health.

aetna collaborates with the march of dimes, the leapfrog group and others on infant safety programs that
encourage women, doctors and hospitals to wait until at least 39 weeks of pregnancy before pursuing electively
scheduled deliveries. deliveries scheduled before 39 weeks remain common in some locations, even though
experts agree it should be limited to situations involving medical need.

care management: a holistic solution
at aetna, care management is defined as caring for people at every
stage of health. for those who are healthy, we help them prevent
disease; for those managing health conditions, we help them care         for a homeless member,
for themselves more effectively; and for those who are sick, we help     one call changed
them get the right care. we also strive to inspire members to commit     everything
to enhancing their own well-being.

                     treatment.


underpinning these professional programs is aetna’s comprehensive suite of easy-to-use tools and resources,
which are available to members and their families.

improving holistic care through integrated behavioral health
long-term illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease can be complicated and costly to treat — especially if they
also involve behavioral health factors. when behavioral health issues go undetected and untreated, they can inter-
fere with a person’s overall health as well as their ability to follow a treatment plan.


         many of the illnesses doctors encounter have an emotional
         or stress-related component. that’s why we are committed
             to improving our members’ total health experience.
clinical teams across aetna have been trained to recognize and assess behavioral health issues that often develop
alongside medical conditions, such as anxiety and depression. our clinicians speak with members using motiva-
tional interviewing techniques, which help to uncover information that members would not necessarily think was
relevant or important to share.


behavioral health condition management

many behavioral health conditions don’t fit neatly into single categories and can overlap each other. this is one
reason why aetna behavioral health plans introduced a new condition management program in 2016. this
comprehensive program aims to engage our members and their families who are struggling with acute, costly and
chronic behavioral health conditions.


the behavioral health condition management program offers:


     •    early identification of potential issues through sophisticated analytics
     •    direct engagement through intensive outreach strategies
     •    health advocacy for members to coordinate and work through co-existing medical and behavioral
          health conditions
     •    a unified approach that can help members access the right treatment, services and resources

compassionate care for difficult times
the aetna compassionate care program helps members and their families through trying times, such as when they
are facing the advanced stages of an illness. our nurse case managers understand the physical, emotional, spiritual
and cultural needs of individuals dealing with a critical illness. they are available by phone to offer support and
information and are skilled in talking about concerns and difficult questions .


nurses can:


                 make it easier to plan for advanced care

                 promote coordination among doctors

                 help members manage their benefits

                 connect you to resources in your community

                 provide support to you and your family, and any of your loved one’s caregivers, including
                 hospice if that becomes necessary




         “my aetna nurse case manager would call periodically and we’d review dad’s doctor appointments, tests, lab
         work and how he was feeling. she would ask me when would be convenient to follow up with a call. little did
         she know how much her calls meant to me. she became my life line. when i was overwhelmed with everything,
         she helped me understand. she was there to see me through it and to guide me through the little things. well,
         they seemed little to her, but they were big to me. things like visiting nurses, physical therapy, wheelchairs,
         walkers and precertification … i will always be grateful to her for being there.”

working to create universal access to aetna’s services
aetna has made significant investments in recent years to help ensure that our web, mobile, online documents,
and other digital experiences are universally accessible to the people we serve. we continually improve our
digital products to conform with digital accessibility standards and have adopted web content accessibility
guidelines (wcag) version 2.0 aa as our company standard.


the cross-disciplinary team in our digital accessibility center promotes and supports enterprise digital
accessibility by:


     •    supporting teams that develop websites, mobile applications and more

     •    coordinating accessibility assessments

     •    managing vendor relationships and software purchasing

     •    ensuring policy and governance for digital accessibility

     •    providing training and education

     •    conducting testing with participants with disabilities



steve famiglietti, blind services vocational manager for new england assistive technology, along with individuals
with low vision and blindness, took part in usability testing for our aetna navigator website in december 2017.



            “i highly commend the staff at aetna for taking the time to do this testing because there are many websites
            out there that are not accessible to people who use screen readers. many times, a screen reader user will
            contact a website author to have specific issues fixed but, in this case, aetna is asking people to do this to
            help them identify such issues and report back to their web authors to fix the problems.”

educating employees, engaging top expertise
acting on our belief that digital accessibility education and training is essential for our employees, we have provided
them with many accessibility training opportunities, such as:


     •    providing all aetna employees with non-discrimination training, which includes accessibility

     •    establishing and promoting standards and best practices for various types of digital products

     •    conducting 29 training events and five technology-based training sessions within our internal learning
          center on digital accessibility, with 6,000 participating employees

     •    creating 10 job-based curricula that focus on development and enhancement of accessibility skills



we continually improve accessibility and user experience by working with those who understand accessibility
needs. these activities include:


     •    collaborating with visually and hearing-impaired analysts to evaluate aetna’s websites, mobile apps,
          and documentation

     •    translating information into braille

     •    providing accessibility support to our internal teams through a dedicated help desk and email account

     •    implementing language translation services across our enterprise, which has involved translating
          more than 15,000 documents and 3,000 digital assets



beyond adhering to compliance guidelines and corporate standards, aetna has committed to increasing
accessibility because it’s the right thing to do for the people we serve.

avoiding medical errors
an unfortunate reality: twice as many people die from medical mistakes and errors than from breast cancer.
we’re trying to make health care safer. for example, our pharmacists, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists and
specialists collectively engage through our health systems to help people avoid unnecessary access to habit-forming
medications.


our efforts include:



     •    monitoring our members’ claims to help them avoid mistakes and errors. we step in thousands of
          times a year to alert patients, doctors and health care facilities of potential safety issues.

     •    removing preauthorization requirements on all buprenorphine products in march 2017. since the
          removal, aetna has observed a nearly 23 percent increase in access to medication-assisted treatment
          among members with an opioid-use disorder.

     •    improving access to multi-modal treatment for aetna members who have chronic pain. during the
          first half of 2017, accessing these treatments increased 50 percent.



each year, our rx check program faxes or mails more than 100,000 letters to medical providers for drug-to-drug
interactions to increase awareness of harmful combinations. meanwhile, aetna’s activehealth management
organization sends tens of millions of “care considerations” (alerts that illustrate missed opportunities for best
practices in medicine or potentially dangerous drug interactions) to providers and patients.

consumer-directed health plans
federal employees and retirees

federal employees and retirees come from all walks of life and have unique health needs. with dozens of plan
choices in the federal employees health benefit program (fehbp), it can be difficult for individuals to find the best
one. aetna has a history of offering innovative products to the federal population, and has plans under the federal
program for all stages of life, from newly hired to retired.


to specifically address the retiree market, we launched aetna direct in 2015. this plan offers low premiums and
waives some out-of-pocket costs. it also has a fund to help pay for medicare part b premium or prescription costs to

medicare stars

the centers for medicare and medicaid services’ (cms)
medicare star ratings are calculated using a scale of one to
five stars (five is best), and may change from year to year,
depending on a plan’s performance. medicare health plans
are rated on how well they perform on five categories:
members staying healthy; managing chronic conditions
of members; member experience with the health plan;
member complaints; and health plan customer service.


aetna once again achieved high medicare star quality
ratings for its medicare advantage plans for 2016 and
2017. in the most recent 2017 star ratings from the cms,
aetna medicare advantage part c plans achieved an overall
enrollment weighted average rating of 4.0 stars. aetna has
increased the number of members enrolled in plans with
a star rating of 4.0 or higher to 91 percent, representing a
four-percentage-point increase from 2016.


in 2017, aetna had the highest percentage of medicare members enrolled in plans rated 4.0 overall stars among
publicly traded companies with over 250,000 medicare advantage enrollees.


privacy breaches

aetna has a comprehensive incident response plan. we follow a rigorous process to immediately halt any ongoing
breach we identify and mitigate the impact to our customers. this includes notifying members as required under
hipaa and other applicable state and federal laws, reporting to the department of health and human services
and applicable state regulators, and taking other steps such as offering free credit monitoring when a member’s
financial information may have been disclosed. we also address the root cause of a breach to strengthen controls,
where necessary, to prevent a reoccurrence.


in 2017, privacy and security activity results included, but were not limited to:


        •    blocking 400k+ malicious phishing emails and enhancing endpoint protection/fraud management


        •    reducing the number of successful emails containing ssns by 26.42 percent


        •    reducing high-severity vulnerabilities by 50 percent, which increases asset resiliency against known
             vulnerabilities

          aetna mobilizes in response to 2017’s natural disasters

          hurricanes harvey, irma and maria devastated
          america’s gulf coast states as well as puerto
          rico in late 2017, while california continued to
          fight against a particularly deadly wildfire season.
          in response to this unprecedented series of
          natural disasters, aetna, its employees and the
          aetna foundation mobilized to provide relief and
          funding support for many impacted communities.


          the aetna foundation provided significant
          funding to nonprofit organizations involved in relief activities in the wake of harvey, irma, maria
          and the california wildfires. the foundation gave more than $1 million in grants, matching grants,
          challenge grants and other funding to communities impacted by these disasters.

strengthening local communities through dynamic partnerships

the aetna foundation is focused on building healthy communities through locally
based programs, dynamic collaborations and proven models that can help accelerate
progress everywhere. helping people live healthier lives and achieve their health goals
is at the heart of the foundation’s mission.


in the united states, research shows that a person’s zip code matters more than their genetic code when it comes
to their health. over the past several years, the aetna foundation has awarded various grants and launched
innovative programs to tackle the social determinants of health — factors that impact a person’s life expectancy
outside of the doctor’s office.


from cultivating healthy communities grantees to healthiest cities & counties challenge participants, the aetna
foundation is providing support to organizations that are addressing local health issues with local solutions.




                                         “we want to see the conversation about health not be just about blood
                                         pressure and whether someone had a stroke, but include the kinds of things in
                                         a community that can help address these kinds of issues. twenty years from
                                         now, we hope to see more linkage between social determinants of health and
                                         healthier communities.”

showcasing excellence: aetna foundation collaboration with
u.s. news & world report

the aetna foundation has teamed up with u.s. news & world report to
evaluate which communities across america are doing the best job of
improving the health of their citizens. the new multi-year u.s. news/aetna
foundation healthiest communities project, launched in march 2018, features
in-depth reporting, analysis and research highlighting exemplary communities.


the ranking is drawn from evaluating over 3,000 counties in 10 categories:
community vitality, equity, economy, education, environment, food and
agriculture, health care, housing, public safety and infrastructure.


the healthiest communities rankings will allow the aetna foundation to go beyond the community
organizations that it supports to showcase communities across america that are doing the best job of
improving their citizens’ health through strategic partnerships, expanded public health assessments and
various education programs. the new program will allow communities to learn from each other, improve their
efforts and help every community develop its own unique “healthy community” agenda.

      better understand opportunities for improvement, as well as inspire ideas for change by showcasing
      the best practices of communities across the country.”

seeking innovation: illuminating sound strategies for community health

our healthiest communities collaboration with u.s. news & world report builds on the momentum of the
healthiest cities & counties challenge, which the aetna foundation launched in 2016 in concert with the american
public health association and national association of counties. the challenge is a competition designed to inspire
communities across the u.s. to create localized solutions to their local problems — and thereby improve the health
of their own residents and community.


open to small and mid-size cities and counties, the challenge requires community
leaders at diﬀerent levels to help solve a problem that aﬀects all members of their
community. in 2017, 50 cities and counties across the u.s. were chosen as ﬁnalists,
and they are competing for part of $1.5 million in prizes for those that show
measurable improvements in health indicators and social determinants of health.


the 50 cities in the challenge are making a difference in their communities, and in
january 2018, we recognized 10 “spotlight award” winners that have demonstrated
progress around key social determinants of health.



        the vision for the challenge is to:


        •    support communities in their collaborative efforts to become healthier places to live, work, learn,
             play and pray;

        •    recognize cities, counties and tribes that achieve a measurable impact in efforts to make
             communities a healthier place to live; and

        •    identify models of eﬀective collaboration that can be sustained and replicated throughout the u.s.

grants to nonproﬁt organizations

the aetna foundation awarded more than $2 million in grants across the u.s. in
2016 to encourage healthy lifestyles. the foundation gave grants to 23 nonprofit
organizations as part of its cultivating healthy communities initiative.


this initiative is designed to promote healthy eating and active living, strengthen
health equity and advance innovations that make it possible for people to experience
more healthy days. the projects will benefit communities by improving health
indicators such as access to healthy foods, increased physical activity, reduced
incidences of bullying, increased spaces for walking and biking safely and more.


what’s most exciting is that these grants put the power to stay healthy in the hands
of community residents—creating sustainable change that can improve health
outcomes nationwide.

in 2016 and 2017, the aetna foundation’s efforts to advance community health have included grants to
organizations that support our mission of building healthy communities. examples include:



                                 ambassadors for christ (afc) youth ministries
                                 building a foundation for healthy living for houston kids
                                 afc youth ministries takes a holistic approach to helping houston kids achieve greater
                                 overall wellness by combining classroom activities, digital learning, physical fitness,
                                 artistic performance camps, and field trips to grocery stores and restaurants. when
                                 hurricane harvey struck houston in august 2017, water flooded the group’s activity
                                 center. in response, the aetna foundation provided a disaster relief grant, which is
                                 helping afc get the vital hub up and running again.


                                 2nd mile ministries
                                 tackling the issue of food deserts in jacksonville
                                 tens of thousands of people in northern florida struggle with food insecurity while
                                 living in “food deserts” that have very limited access to fresh, nutritious food options.
                                 2nd mile ministries is addressing this issue in jacksonville, funded in part by a grant
                                 from the aetna foundation. among the group’s activities is their management of a
                                 community garden, which helps to meet basic food needs for residents of the city’s
                                 brentwood neighborhood. there, many people have access solely to convenience
                                 stores or local corner shops that offer little produce or other fresh foods.

                                 clean air council
                                 providing tools for a healthier environment in philadelphia
                                 air quality in the philadelphia’s kensington neighborhood has long been hindered
                                 by local industrial activity, fumes and ash emissions from scrapyards, and pollution
                                 generated by construction work and traﬃc congestion. however, area residents now
                                 have the ability to record the scope and severity of the unhealthy air due to a new
                                 air-monitoring program run by the clean air council (cac), and funded by an aetna
                                 foundation grant. using a small monitor in concert with a smartphone, residents
                                 can capture a range of real-time data from their environment, including levels of
                                 dangerous pollutants in the air. the information is designed to prompt greater
                                 recognition of kensington’s air-quality challenges — and to spur corrective action.


                                 jack & jill children’s center
                                 focusing on the family to address social determinants of health in fort lauderdale
                                 improving community health is a diﬃcult challenge in fort lauderdale, which has
                                 florida’s highest incidences of physical and mental abuse, accidental death, neglect
                                 and long-term poverty. this is why the jack & jill children’s center created a program
                                 that aims to strengthen the health of families in a number of diﬀerent ways. with
                                 funding from the aetna foundation, the children’s center is launching a financial
                                 literacy and family health program to teach families gardening, healthy eating, and
                                 stress management skills. a special training series will also teach parents about ways
                                 to make more ﬁnancially sound decisions and budget for a healthy lifestyle.

tackling inequities in health care access and quality
inequities in health care access and quality affect communities and individuals across the nation. working with
national partners, the aetna foundation strives to reduce inequities in health treatment and outcomes through
research, experimentation and education. we also seek to cultivate a more diverse generation of medical
professionals who are equipped to reduce the massive toll that chronic diseases take on underserved communities
nationwide.


these are just a few of our partnerships nationally that aim to improve health care access and quality:

                                mobile insulin titration intervention (miti) is a text message-based program that helps
                                alleviate logistical barriers to care for type 2 diabetic patients needing insulin titration.
                                implemented at two new york city safety-net hospitals, the program has improved
                                health in terms of access, care delivery design, and social determinants of health (sdoh)
                                that pose barriers to in-person care. now, to better impact overall health, nyu is using
                                an aetna foundation grant to explore a broader array of the sdoh. to do this, the
                                university has interviewed patients about the barriers to care they experience, and is
                                developing a program model by which patient-centered information can be shared by
                                care teams in real-time with existing local resource programs.

                                the rate of emergency room visits is 50 percent higher than the u.s. national average.
                                with support from the aetna foundation, the dc connect project is attempting to
                                address these challenges by creating a virtual network of providers. this virtual network
                                will help address clinical needs while also providing person-centered care to help solve
                                complex needs such as food insecurity, housing, transportation and even loneliness.

                                through both health care resources and links to social services. this multidimensional,
                                patient-centered approach has proven to reduce hospital emergency department

            fighting the opioid epidemic
             leading the industry in creating effective, multifaceted
           responses through new programs, vital policy changes and
                           community partnerships.
the opioid epidemic is the leading public health issue facing our nation, negatively impacting the lives of
thousands of american families. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has estimated that in 2016,
64,000 americans died of drug overdoses — three times the rate in 1999 and up 21 percent from 2015.
furthermore, america’s addiction crisis has led to a two-year consecutive decline in our country’s life expectancy,
an alarming demographic trend we haven’t witnessed since the 1960s.1

aetna understands the importance of fighting the opioid epidemic. our goal is to help our members who are
struggling with addiction return to a productive life free of opioids. aetna’s various business segments are working
to support this goal and to prevent future opioid dependency, while aligning with the evolving legal and regulatory
guidance surrounding the opioid epidemic. we also are committed to working with state and federal officials to
advocate for legislative and regulatory solutions to enable greater public-private partnerships in addressing this
epidemic.


additionally, the aetna foundation aims to do its part to combat the epidemic with a new, multimillion-dollar
funding commitment. the aetna foundation opioid response initiative will provide $6 million in grants to states
hit hardest by the crisis, funding state and local projects that can potentially make a real difference in addressing
opioid-related challenges. this commitment is part of the foundation’s mission to build healthier communities by
supporting locally based programs, dynamic partnerships, and proven models.

                                   in the spotlight

          our multifaceted approach to a complex challenge
          america’s opioid epidemic is a health problem with no single solution. addressing it requires multiple
          approaches, including promoting appropriate prescribing, preventing harm from overdose, and
          supporting individuals with opioid-use disorder to initiate and sustain recovery. accordingly, aetna’s
          response to help members with substance-related disorders involves different areas of expertise
          and different integrated initiatives.


          in early 2016, aetna’s health & clinical services group launched the company’s enterprise-wide
          opioid taskforce (ewot). the task force comprises representatives from various business areas,
          such as health & clinical services, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health, and is chaired by aetna’s
          chief medical officer, harold l. paz, m.d., m.s.


          the group has been instrumental in thinking through aetna’s comprehensive strategy to combat the
          opioid epidemic and developing five-year goals to help prevent misuse, abuse and addiction. aetna
          is committed to three goals, which are the benchmarks against which all of our opioid efforts will be
          measured. by 2022, we are committed to:




                         increasing the percentage of members with chronic pain treated by non-opioid
                         treatment alternatives by 50 percent (e.g., physical therapy or occupational
                         therapy, chiropractic, acupuncture, psychotherapy, biofeedback and non-opioid
                         medications, such as anti-inflammatories).


                         reducing the percentage of inappropriate opioid prescribing for our members by
                         50 percent.


                         increasing the percentage of members with opioid-use disorder treated with
                         medication-assisted treatment (mat) and other evidence-based treatments by
                         50 percent.



          in pursuing these goals, aetna is executing a comprehensive strategy that involves preventing misuse
          and abuse, intervening when we identify at-risk behavior and supporting patients with access to
          evidence-based treatments.

partnerships: supporting states’ eﬀorts to fight the opioid crisis
the aetna foundation in early 2018 launched a new opioid-response funding program that provides $6 million
in total funding to grantees in six states hard-hit by the epidemic. the grants will provide important resources to
empower local communities to address the unique characteristics of the opioid-related problems they are facing.


the first such grant was given to the north carolina harm reduction coalition, which is receiving $1 million for its
“rural opioid overdose prevention project.” the funding will help provide community-level risk education in five of
the state’s rural counties; distribute naloxone kits to rural, high-risk opioid users; and increase adoption of best-
practice policies on overdose prevention.

        there is no “one size ﬁts all” solution to ﬁghting this epidemic. the time is now to

        project will curb addiction by:




           increasing residents ability to              increasing law enforcement            creating best practices

prevention: reducing the rate of opioid prescribing
advancing pain-management alternatives

aetna is focused on helping its members avoid unnecessary opioid use and effectively manage opioid use when
needed. in doing so, we’re striving—where possible and appropriate—to increase the use of alternative therapies
for members’ pain relief, such as physical therapy, chiropractic/osteopathic manipulative treatment, massage (in
conjunction with physical therapy), cognitive behavioral therapy, and other effective alternative modalities.

for members who are dealing with chronic pain, aetna supports a multi-disciplinary treatment approach, including
both outpatient and inpatient treatment programs that consider physical, social, and behavioral factors.

reducing the flow of prescription opioids

in 2016, to promote prescriber education and prevent potential overprescribing, aetna sent letters to the top 1
percent of opioid prescribers within their respective specialties to make them aware of their outlier prescribing
patterns. these approximately 1,000 opioid “super-prescribers” were also provided the 2016 cdc guidelines for the
use of opioids for the management of chronic pain. in 2017, aetna also sent 480 individualized letters to “super-
prescriber” dentists and, in collaboration with the american association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, sent 249
letters to “super-prescriber” oral surgeons.

aetna now limits initial opioid prescriptions for acute pain to a seven-day supply, as well as a limit of 90 milligrams
of morphine equivalency per day, which helps to reduce the potential for abuse and risk of addiction. we also
require prior authorization for all opioids for acute pain beyond the seven-day initial fill, and also require prior
authorization for all opioids used for the treatment of chronic pain.

we seek to support our members who are recovering from opioid dependency and/or are at risk of an opioid
overdose. to that end, aetna has removed prior authorization requirements on generic drugs that treat opioid
addiction, including oral buprenorphine/naloxone and generic dosages of suboxone and subutex.

aetna helps to improve health care outcomes for medicaid plan members through coordinated, individualized

medicaid patients often face unique medical, financial and geographic challenges, so we make it a priority to
innovate and adapt our solutions to deliver real results. we partner with nonprofits to deliver vital care to those
in rural areas who have little access to health services. we try novel approaches: providing supportive
employment to members with severe mental illnesses, which has dramatically decreased their rate of inpatient
medical hospitalizations; and embedding population-health specialists in the offices of providers, who have seen
a 75 percent reduction in patients’ emergency room visits.

           partnering to bring health care to people in rural communities

          in mid-2017, thousands of disabled, ill and economically disadvantaged americans converged on a
          temporary medical facility in rural western virginia to wait patiently in line for health care services
          that for many were long overdue. the vital care was delivered by a renowned nonprofit, remote
          area medical® (ram), with significant financial support from aetna.


           ram operates mobile medical clinics that deliver free, high-quality vision, dental and medical
           services to people who do not have access to a doctor or cannot afford to visit one. in 2017, aetna
           became the first health care company to partner with ram and provide a substantial donation to
           the organization to support their work. we also are expanding our relationship with ram in other
           areas of the country so that aetna members in rural areas — particularly those with gaps in care
           and unmet health and social determinants needs — can visit these mobile clinics to receive care.


           ram’s four-day clinic in wise, virginia, serves between 1,500 and 2,500 medically underserved
           individuals at a cost of about $100,000. in both 2016 and 2017, the aetna foundation provided
           significant grants to support ram’s health wagon medical services. aetna’s virginia medicaid unit
           also contributed to ram in 2016 and has operated a tent at the wise county event for three years,
           where individuals have been able to talk with aetna employees about medicaid and general health
           care issues.

study highlights care improvements for arizona plan members
arizona’s mercy maricopa integrated care (mmic), one of many medicaid groups aetna administers nationally, has
developed an innovative, integrated approach to serving medicaid members with severe mental illnesses. this
approach, which combines supportive housing, supportive employment and
intensive community treatment, was recently studied by norc at the university of
chicago to determine how well it improved health outcomes and quality of care,
while reducing total cost of care.


norc’s findings suggest that improvements in quality of care can be achieved by shifting services from more
intensive inpatient and residential stays to outpatient and routine behavioral health care focused on chronic illness
care. for example, norc found that mmic plan members who took advantage of supportive employment saw a
35 percent decrease in inpatient medical hospitalizations, and members who took part in assertive community
treatment saw an 8 percent reduction in er visits.


along with these improvements in member care, the study revealed significant cost savings (see chart).

applying population health strategies in louisiana
in louisiana, aetna’s medicaid group recently incorporated population health specialists into its integrated system
of care. this action has helped to reduce the number of patients needing to visit emergency rooms or be admitted
to hospitals.


these aetna specialists, all registered nurses, work directly within large provider practices to assist providers in
enhancing population health. the specialists:


     •    engage local providers in a clinically integrated approach to support and enhance the provider-patient
          relationship
     •    identify current and emerging high-risk members needing care and services, including addressing social
          determinants of health and independence
     •    coordinate community resources for members receiving long-term services and support


among providers who engaged with our specialists, 75 percent saw reductions in emergency room visits ranging
from 5 percent to 16 percent, and 100 percent of them achieved reductions in inpatient utilization, ranging from
about 24 percent to 60 percent.

          poverty simulation experience:
          medicaid professionals put themselves in the patient’s shoes

          too often, medicaid members live in poverty and are forced to compromise one basic need, such as
          health care, in order to meet other needs in their lives.


          to better understand the tradeoffs facing
          medicaid members who live in poverty, aetna
          medicaid professionals recently took part in a
          poverty simulation experience (pse). the exercise
          consisted of four 15-minute ‘weeks’ where
          employees worked together to navigate a series
          of daily stresses and challenges that people living
          in poverty often face in real life. some of these
          challenges included trying to live on a budget
          below the poverty level, scraping together money
          for utilities and food, dealing with health and
          daycare issues without losing hours at work or
          income, or trying to make ends meet by resorting                     note: photo from a recent poverty simulation

          to illegal activities, such as selling drugs or stealing.


          employees who took part in the exercise shared such insights as these:

                 •    “it reminded me how important it is to have empathy for individuals who feel
                      powerless and to help ﬁnd more ways to empower them.”


                 •    “i understand the challenges families face but did not consider the choices families
                      must face. food and shelter take priority over their health. we must understand those
                      challenges when working with our members.”

                    honoring and supporting
                     our nation’s veterans
committed to supporting america’s veterans, aetna is creating opportunities for veterans and their families to help
them overcome challenges as they re-enter civilian life. aetna is also placing an emphasis on hiring, developing and
retaining top talent from within veteran, active duty and guard and reserve communities, while also supporting
several veterans-related organizations and programs.


three percent of aetna’s employees are veterans. we are privileged to help servicemen and servicewomen re-enter
the civilian workforce by offering a variety of employee benefits and resources, including physical, emotional and
financial wellness programs, events, networking opportunities and mentorship.


we believe that our nation’s service members and veterans represent a great source of talent to companies
like aetna. these men and women bring to the workplace many specialized talents, global experience and an
abundance of critical transferable skills. veterans are:



          •     trained team builders and leaders.
          •     able to adapt and act quickly in changing situations.
          •     results oriented — they have a strong work ethic, thrive under pressure, and exhibit high levels
                of resiliency and focus despite challenges.
          •     knowledgable in global perspectives and bring diversity to the workplace.
          •     skilled in technology.

      aetna has ‘world-class’ goals for its supplier diversity program
      diverse suppliers and small businesses give aetna more than just quality products and services: they
      provide unique perspectives and insights that enhance aetna’s success in a dynamic marketplace.

      for this reason, aetna in recent years has made supplier diversity a priority, forging a broad range of
      successful relationships. in 2010, this commitment was transformed into an aggressive goal: achieve
      world-class supplier diversity. what does this mean? by 2020, the company intends to rely on diverse
      suppliers for at least 15 percent of its spending, while also developing relationships with targeted
      suppliers. in 2017, we achieved 12.6 percent supplier diversity spending, more than 2 percent above our
      year-end goal.

      aetna stands out among its peers for its broad view of supplier diversity, which encompasses
      partnerships, customer advisory groups, broker and provider networks, and other important constituents.
      such a progressive stance has helped aetna develop a high-profile, national reputation in this arena.



supplier diversity
consistent with our company’s pursuit of diversity goals, we take every opportunity to be inclusive in our sourcing
activities. with this understanding, we have established proactive efforts to reach traditionally underutilized (tuu)
suppliers. strong supplier diversity helps us understand and serve multicultural constituents more effectively. it lets
us purchase a broader range of high-quality products and services, and it heightens our ability to serve the many
communities in which we live and work.

directly with tuu suppliers. each year, we establish both enterprise and business-area supplier diversity targets
that are directly tied to the company’s overall performance scorecard. performance is tracked and shared with key
business-area leaders and the company’s executive committee.


to be successful, we believe that our support of tuu suppliers must be mirrored by that of the companies
with which we do business. this is why our program’s second objective is to develop second-tier purchasing
partnerships. aetna requires our prime suppliers to meet second-tier targets in support of both our supplier
diversity strategy and business needs.


as an enterprise, we strive to demonstrate year-over-year growth in our supplier diversity expenditures.


     •    in 2017, aetna’s first- and second-tier expense (or spend) with certified minority-owned, women-
          owned, lesbian-, gay-, bisexual-, transgender-, or queer-owned (lgbtq), disability-owned, veteran-
          owned, and registered small businesses totaled $357.9 million. this represents a significant increase
          from tuu supplier spend of $264 million in 2016.


we are further strengthening our ability to be inclusive in our sourcing activities by proactively engaging
traditionally tuu suppliers. in 2017, we took part in tuu-focused meetings, conferences and other events involving
a range of leading organizations, including: greater new england minority supplier development council; women
presidents education organization; women’s business enterprise national council; national business inclusion
consortium; national minority supplier development council; and others.

transportation

employee commuting represents an opportunity for aetna to decrease ghg emissions. aetna’s telework program
increases flexibility and work/life balance for our employees, while also reducing carbon emissions by eliminating
unnecessary commuting and associated gasoline and diesel emissions.


aetna introduced the telework program in 2007, and has offered many employees the opportunity to work from
home via remote desktop access. in 2017, the telecommuter program saved more than 5.9 million gallons of
gasoline and 52,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions.




                                       47,096,080 gallons gasoline (2017)
                                       41,106,080 gallons gasoline (2016)



                                       414,836 metric tons co2 emissions (2017)
                                       362,136 metric tons co2 emissions (2016)



additionally, aetna encourages the use of alternative-fuel vehicles, and has electric vehicle charging stations at
two corporate campus locations. as previously reported, aetna installed three plug-in electric power (pep) stations
at the hartford campus for employees and a fourth station for a security vehicle, as well as two pep stations at the
blue bell campus.

building fixture eﬃciency

less than one percent of the world’s water supply is available for human use1; however, access to potable water is
essential to a healthy life. this makes water protection and conservation essential to assure access to clean water
for all.


strategies for reducing water and energy usage include installing low-flow water closets, showerheads, urinals and
faucets with sensors.


aetna continues its commitment to reduce water usage by installing low-flow fixtures when lavatories are renovated
in both owned and leased properties.


in 2006, aetna launched a multiyear construction project to upgrade the water fixtures at the hartford campus.
since the program launch, the hartford campus has reduced overall water consumption from 9,500 gallons per
employee per year to an all-time low of 3,581 gallons per employee per year in 2017 — a reduction of more than 60
percent.



                                       191,248,849 gallons of water saved (2017)
                                       16,917,730 gallons of water saved (2016, only ct)




aetna corporate social responsibility report                                                                          78

building commissioning

building commissioning ensures all building systems are functioning at peak performance based on the needs and
operations of the facility. if systems or materials fail to perform at their peak levels, employee comfort may be nega-
tively impacted. system failures also require more intensive use of water and energy resources. retro-commission-
ing is regularly performed at existing buildings to restore them to optimal performance.


facility commissioning strategies include:


          •     installation and operational checks conducted by a trained maintenance professional
          •     regular updates of operations and maintenance manuals and training materials
          •     ongoing system-monitoring upgrades




                    we are committed to ensuring that our owned
                     properties operate at peak performance.
aetna has invested in upgrading hvac systems at several facilities. at the hartford campus, the installation of a
plate and frame heat exchanger and the operation of airside economizers allow for the free cooling of the building
during the winter months. all air-handling systems at the hartford campus utilize an outside air economizer to
cool the entire complex during normal business hours during the winter. additionally, both of our data centers
in middletown and windsor, connecticut, utilize free cooling to cool the entire data center at full load during the
winter months.


in 2015, aetna completed retro-commissioning for its home office in hartford. the retro-commissioning project
helps ensure that all systems operate at peak performance. the program continues to save energy at a rate of
3,185,133 kilowatt hours (kwh) electricity and 73,100 centum cubic feet (ccf) natural gas per year as compared to
the baseline year of 2012.


in 2016, aetna also completed a retro-commissioning project at its data centers in middletown and windsor,
connecticut. the program centered on the optimization of the computer room air conditioning units (cracs) and
reduced energy usage by approximately 50 percent. this equates to an estimated annual savings of 924,300 kwh in
middletown and 636,000 kwh in windsor.


retro-commissioning at these three facilities has resulted in a total annual savings of 4,745,433 kwh electricity and
74,580 ccf natural gas or a reduction of 2,778 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (co2e) emissions.

optimize energy performance

aetna has a goal to reduce energy consumption by 2 percent per year at select owned and leased sites and has
successfully implemented various energy-saving techniques, including replacing old wooden windows with energy-
efficient ones, upgrading lighting to higher-efficiency lamps and ballasts, and installing energy star-rated devices
and automatic shut-off switches. currently, the rogers building at the harford campus is undergoing a major light
emitting diode (led) lighting retrofit which is projected to reduce the campus’ annual electrical consumption by
approximately 6 percent.


aetna has also established a green data center program, allowing the data centers in middletown and windsor
to operate 20 percent more efficiently. the program reduces energy consumption using various information
technology (it) and building management strategies. it strategies include, but are not limited to, the use of
“virtualized” servers and high-density computer environments featuring dose-coupled cooling systems. building
management strategies include increasing discharge water temperatures in line with ashrae guidelines. from 2010
to 2017, these strategies reduced energy consumption by over 35.5 million kwh. these reductions occurred despite
the fact that business demands for data storage and systems capacity increased significantly.


                                           owned portfolio grid electricity usage, 2010-2017


      2010               2011                  2012      2013         2014          2015         2016         2017

even while more than doubling the owned portfolio of facilities in 2014, energy-saving initiatives, including the
green data center program, have avoided 46 million kwh electricity usage — nearly a 7 percent reduction — since
2010 levels. this is equivalent to 34,231 metric tons of co2e emissions2.

aetna has also earned leadership in energy & environmental design (leed) silver for renovation projects it
completed at the aetna customer center and atrium in hartford in 2009 and 2012. all aetna-owned facilities were
benchmarked in the u.s. epa’s energy star portfolio manager program for 2016. the program allows aetna to
monitor each building’s energy-consumption levels.


                                       45,996,051 kwh electricity saved (2017)
                                       35,933,858 kwh electricity saved (2016)


                                       34,231 metric tons co2e emissions avoided (2017)
                                       25,253 metric tons co2e emissions avoided (2016)


                                       2 leed-certified buildings (2017)
                                       2 leed-certified buildings (2016)


additionally, aetna leases 16 leed-certified buildings and 35 buildings with an energy star score of 75 or greater.
we continue to work closely with newmark knight frank, a premier facility management group, to achieve energy
star certification for select sites.

aetna corporate social responsibility report                                                                          80

renewable energy

renewable energy comprised 10 percent of the u.s. energy portfolio in 20163. the federal government and many
state governments have enacted policies aimed at increasing the percentage of renewable energy in the u.s. they
have offered a variety of tax credits to incentivize the use of renewable energy.


aetna recognizes the importance of decreasing our reliance on fossil fuels to reduce total u.s. ghg emissions.
aetna understands that ghg emissions decrease the air quality of the communities where our customers live,
resulting in a variety of adverse health impacts. as a leader in the health care field, we are committed to improving
the health of our customers and their communities.


between january 2010 and october 2015, aetna installed more than 3,000 solar panels. the renewable energy
credits (recs) generated by these arrays are sold to a state entity and to the local utility company, which helps to
increase the amount of renewable energy on the electrical grid.


the systems were designed to have a total baseline production of 913,389 kwh of electricity and in 2017 produced a
total of 828,134 kwh of electricity. an additional solar array is currently under development in phoenix, arizona, and
scheduled to go online in 2018. this array is expected to produce approximately 340,000 kwh of solar energy per
year.


solar array electricity production in kwh:




between 2010 and 2017, the combined output of our solar arrays has provided 4,096,421 kwh of electricity. this is
equivalent to 3,049 metric tons of co2e emissions saved.


                                       4,096,421 kwh electricity saved (2017)
                                       3,268,287 kwh electricity saved (2016)



                                       3,049 metric tons co2e emissions avoided (2017)
                                       2,297 metric tons co2e emissions avoided (2016)

in addition to solar energy, aetna purchased 7,600 megawatt hours (mwh) of us wind erecs in 2017. this is
equivalent to approximately 10 percent of the total electricity use at all aetna-owned facilities.

aetna corporate social responsibility report                                                                           81

source reduction & waste management

waste reduction is a global issue and a growing concern. in 1960, americans generated 2.7 pounds of municipal
solid waste (msw) per person per day. by 2014, that figure had increased by more than 160 percent to 4.4 pounds
per person per day, resulting in a total production of 258 million tons of msw4.


aetna recognizes that, as an industry leader, we find ways to generate less waste. waste reduction strategies exist
for msw, as well as hazardous and electronic waste. we are committed to the proper handling and management of
these materials to protect public health.


by communicating and collaborating with our suppliers, we ensure thorough consideration of the choice, design,
and production of products used in our operations. this approach helps to reduce the amount of waste generated.


aetna has focused on reducing the total volume of waste while also diverting the waste we do generate away from
landfills. at the facilities aetna owns, we have implemented initiatives to recycle paper, cardboard, glass and plastic
bottles and fluorescent bulbs. we also participate in a program to recycle confidential shredded paper across all of
our operating facilities.


since 2009, the aetna-owned portfolio has recycled 3,247 tons of material including paper, cardboard, metal and co-
mingled bottles and cans. this is equivalent to a savings of 12,111 metric tons of co2e emissions.


                                       3,247 tons recycled material (2017)
                                       2,949 tons recycled material (2016)


                                       12,111 metric tons co2e emissions avoided (2017)
                                       10,530 metric tons co2e emissions avoided (2016)

aetna’s 2017 csr report is our second report developed in accordance with global reporting initiative (gri)

reporting boundaries

the report covers activities and impacts under aetna inc.’s operations within united states, unless otherwise
stated. environmental performance data is based on our owned properties only, since data from leased properties
are subject to negotiation with property owners and are difficult to collect in a meaningful, consistent form. all of
the locations from which we do business outside the united states are leased. aetna owns only 10 of its 150 u.s.
locations. data is collected from all owned locations, except as noted in the chart below.

materiality and reporting
aetna’s corporate social responsibility statement encapsulates our commitment to ethically and responsibly
pursuing a collaborative, multifaceted approach to developing a healthier population. part of this effort is to
promote sustainable practices in our workplaces and in the communities in which we operate.

our corporate social responsibility council provides strategic guidance on fulfilling our social responsibility
objectives. it also monitors our progress. the council is composed of members who have varied expertise,
and includes representatives from real estate services, diversity, compliance, community activation and
local marketing, procurement, government relations, consumer business, human resources, enterprise
communications and the aetna foundation, inc.

in establishing social responsibility objectives, the council employs a risk management approach that takes into
account business and reputational risk, financial implications and regulatory factors. issues like sustainability and
climate change that may potentially have a significant impact on the company are brought before the council. the
council shares information about potential risks and opportunities with executive leadership.

aetna’s executive vice president of corporate affairs oversees the council, as well as aetna’s sustainability
practices, public policy positions and reporting against corporate social responsibility (csr) goals.

aetna’s 2014 csr report was the first to be issued in accordance with global reporting initiative (gri) g4
guidelines. this 2016-2017 csr report also adheres to these guidelines.

we conducted a robust materiality assessment to determine the content of this report. this process involved
gathering input from internal and external information sources, and soliciting feedback from numerous executives
across the enterprise. to further inform our assessment, we also considered data that was collected from a recent
review of aetna plan member appeals and service center call data, and information that was obtained through our
annual customer forum. one of the main purposes of the customer forum is to strengthen partnerships with key
stakeholders while also gaining a greater understanding about how to better serve our members and help them
navigate the future of health care.

top issues for stakeholders

we have looked at health from the perspective of the employee, the employer, the provider and the system. the
foundation has examined the issues impacting health within communities. we’ve explored how to best navigate
what’s on the horizon in the ever-changing health care landscape. we believe these issues continue to be top
priorities for both our business and external stakeholders.


      the most important issues to both our business and to external stakeholders continue to be:

                      improved outcomes                                     customer privacy


                      access to coverage                                    community development


                      plan performance/customer satisfaction                employee diversity and inclusion


                      pricing transparency and plan literacy                employee development


for most of these issues, the impact is primarily outside of our organization, affecting our customers and members.
the exceptions are those issues related to employee diversity and inclusion and employee development, which
affect our employees.

stakeholder engagement

our third comprehensive csr report is another important step in our journey of social responsibility. by publicly
reporting our social sustainability performance, we can start a dialogue with our stakeholders on these issues. by
engaging with stakeholders and gaining a better understanding of their concerns, we can improve our business
performance and have a greater positive impact on society.


for this report, we engaged our csr council to inform our csr materiality assessment and reporting strategy. we
considered the perspectives of our employees, customers, communities, investors and governments. we selected
this group for our initial csr stakeholder engagement, which was undertaken as part of the report preparation
process, because of their insight into all aspects of aetna’s business. the csr council validated the sustainability
materiality assessment results and suggested additional topics for csr reporting. going forward, we plan to expand
and formalize our stakeholder engagement activities.


we welcome your feedback and thoughts on this report and our social responsibility program. please contact us at
aetna-csr@aetna.com.

assessments of more than $50,000 in a calendar year.


we also indicate the portion of such dues considered nondeductible as lobbying and political expenses under
applicable tax law.

governance and ethics
our reputation for excellence and integrity is one of our most valuable assets. we have earned this reputation by
delivering quality products and services, and by adhering to the highest standards of business conduct. our board
of directors and company management believe that sound corporate governance principles help ensure that our
standards of excellence, integrity, inspiration and caring are applied to all aspects of our operations.


we have embraced the principles behind the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, as well as the governance rules for
companies listed on the new york stock exchange. we also have implemented governance changes in compliance
with the requirements of the wall street reform and consumer protection act (the “dodd-frank act”). these
principles and requirements are reflected in the structure and composition of our board of directors, our committee
charters and our corporate governance policies. they are reinforced through aetna’s code of conduct, which
applies to every employee and director, and they inform how we engage with all of our stakeholders.


aetna requires all employees and key suppliers to revisit and annually document their familiarity with the code
of conduct. the importance of the code of conduct is underscored in aetna chairman and ceo mark bertolini’s
message to employees:


         “our code of conduct is grounded in and reflects the principles at the heart of the aetna way. the code
         guides our compliance with the rules and regulations that govern our business throughout the world. if we
         apply this code to all aspects of our business, we will fulfill our promise to operate in accordance with the
         law, company policies and our core values.


         although the code can’t cover every imaginable situation, it does provide you with examples of everyday
         situations to assist you in resolving potential problems and general guidance for performing your job
         responsibilities with integrity. also included is a list of contacts for you to use in seeking advice or reporting
         concerns.


         ultimately, our reputation relies on the sound judgment and personal integrity of every aetna employee,
         regardless of your level in the organization. if you are ever in doubt as to the right course of action, use
         the aetna way and our ethical decision-making framework to help you make the right decisions. if you
         ever have reason to believe that a legal or ethical violation has occurred, you need to report it immediately
         to your manager, business compliance officer, the law department or the aetna alertline®. our policies
         forbid any form of retaliation against you for fulfilling this obligation.


         i expect each of you to read, understand and follow our code of conduct. please consult it throughout
         the year, as needed. your commitment to compliance, all company policies, and the laws and regulations
         applicable to our businesses contributes directly to our success as a company. please join me in renewing
         our commitment to protecting and strengthening aetna’s reputation for integrity and keeping our promises
         to each other and those we serve.”
                                                                      – mark t. bertolini, aetna chairman and ceo


we believe that our corporate governance policies, principles and practices are good for our business, our industry,
the competitive marketplace. they also reflect the values we hold dear as a company, and our deep appreciation for
all those who place their trust in us.


we maintain a publicly accessible website that contains information about our corporate governance policies and
practices. the site can be accessed from about us/investor information on aetna.com.
