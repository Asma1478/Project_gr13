                                      health and safety


     “health and safety first” is our motto
     and employee well-being and safety
     is the most important aspect of doing
     business for us. we continuously
     strive to create a safe and healthy
     work environment and safety culture
     within the organization. this way
     we aspire to develop a sense of
     ownership amongst all employees
     to treat safety with paramount
     importance.
     we also offer our workforce an ample range of healthcare services,
     including measures going beyond health care at the place of work.
     health surveillance covering facilities like x-ray, pathological           gymnasium   safety oath by our people
     laboratory, audiometry, ecg, spirometry, etc. is available in our in-
     house wellness management centre. moreover, annual health
     check-up programmes have been instituted for the benefit of the
     employees. further, employees working regularly in the packing area,                                               world heart day celebration
     face risk of developing respiratory disease. hence, we conduct half
     yearly medical tests of these employees and ensure strict control on
     ppe usage in these operations.

     we start each month with 'environment and safety day' to motivate
     the entire work force, including union representatives and
     contractual workers. during this interaction, best practices for safety,
     learnings from incidents, review of previous month safety activities
     and plans for the current month are discussed.

     to drive the safety culture, a safety committee is functional at all our
     operations and is manned by equal participation from management
     and worker representatives. apart from this, the safety excellence
     journey that was initiated by ras unit in 2012 has been effectively
     adopted by smp. an apex committee along with six sub-committees,
     giving special emphasis on safety observation, has been established.
     the six sub-committees are a) safety observation & audit sub-
     committee, b) incident investigation sub-committee, c) rules &
     procedure sub-committee, d) contractor safety management sub-
     committee, e) training & capability sub-committee and f) transport
     sub-committee.

     scl believes holistic socio-
     economic development of the
     local community is the need of
     the hour. all the development
     related and community support
     activities are driven at all our
     cement manufacturing and
     grinding units and have
     continuous on-going social
     intervention.
     social intervention with a positive impact has become an
     integral part of our business. we have spent more than 1.5%
     of our profits in social developmental activities in the past.
     with the introduction of new companies act 2013, that
     mandates companies to spend 2% of the average profits in
     the preceding 3 years, our voluntary initiatives have taken
     the shape of compliance. however, we shall continue the
     endeavour to support our development commitments as
     well as meet the compliance with the companies act, 2013.
     in reporting period, we spent 1.61% of our average profits in
     the last three years in social activities and we are expanding
     our social intervention programs to meet the criteria of the
     companies act, 2013 from the next reporting cycle.

     scl contributes in the area of education, skill development
     of people in the local communities, healthcare services for
     local communities, women empowerment and
     infrastructure development in local communities. we
     regularly engage with the community through formal and
     informal interactions to identify their key issues and
     concerns and based on these need based assessments, the
     csr programmes are customised and implemented while
     partnering with government agencies, ngos, local
     panchayats for implementation. 'village development
     committees' are also formed to engage with the
     community as well as plan, monitor and coordinate the csr
     activities.

     social impact assessment exercises were conducted in the
     last reporting period at our beawar and ras locations to
     gauge the effectiveness of our engagement programs.
     consultants were engaged to conduct the assessment
     covering ten villages around ras operations and five villages
     around the beawar operations. based on the results and
     recommendations of the impact assessment, we had
     identified specific objectives with integrated plans to
     effectively benefit the wider community and worked
     towards the same in the reporting period.
