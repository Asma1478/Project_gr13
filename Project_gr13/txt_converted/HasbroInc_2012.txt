                         formalizing kpis
                         we are working to develop formalized, company-wide key performance indicators
                         (kpis) to track our progress on social and environmental goals across the business
                         and streamline our processes internally. however, because of the lack of harmonized
                         kpis globally across our csr priority areas this proves to be particularly more difficult.


                         tracking greenhouse gas (ghg) scope 3 emissions
                         as we expand the reporting of our ghg scope 3 emissions, we are working to track
                         and confirm the environmental footprint of our transportation and distribution partners,
                         manufacturing vendors, warehouse operations and other third party suppliers. we are
                         currently working with our third party manufacturing facilities, establishing internal
                         processes to track ghg emissions and have begun to solicit third party verification
                         on this data. for certain vendors, we have less visibility into emissions data, so hasbro
                         teams are also working to verify this data internally with an eye toward third party
                         verification in years to come.


                         promoting ethical manufacturing among suppliers
                         hasbro’s commitment to ethical manufacturing includes a process of rigorous review of
                         our suppliers’ practices. working hours and transparency continue to be our biggest
                         known challenges in this regard. to address these issues, hasbro works in conjunction
                         with the icti care process to develop corrective action plans for factories with violations,
                         solicit commitments to improvement from each factory, and actively work with factories
                         to ensure all areas of non-compliance are corrected. for factories that do not improve
                         their standing within a predetermined timeframe, our policy is to move production
                         to different facilities. we believe our strong and longstanding relationships with our
                         manufacturing partners are due in part to this collaborative approach.


                         formalizing our approach to human rights
                         we value the safety, wellness and dignity of every worker throughout our supply chain.
                         in 2011, we identified an opportunity to formalize our approach to human rights and
                         began to evaluate and explore our operations and supply chain.
