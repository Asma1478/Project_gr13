    a journey into our future
    our reports are not simply reporting documents.
    their aim is to provide a comprehensive overview
    of how the group creates value with regard to
    a number of major contemporary issues. these
    issues, of course, outline the field of action of
    a global insurance player such as ours: more
    specifically, demographic trends, climate change,
    the company’s social role and, above all, the
    changes dictated by innovation technology.
    innovation is indeed the cross-cutting issue of
    generali’s 2016 reports, viewed from different
    perspectives: customers, who are evermore
    well-informed and interconnected; agents, the
    cornerstone of a distribution strategy increasingly
    open to multimedia; employees, actively involved
    in a process of cultural and operational change;
    big data management, a key tool for interpreting
    the world surrounding us and anticipating its
    developments. and then the internet of things,
    mobility and the major topic of growth, the real
    challenge not only for businesses but for all
    policymakers who need to take decisions in such
    complicated times.
    this year, readers will be accompanied by
    illustrations created by artists who have used,
    each in their own way, a symbolic and coloured
    language to outline concepts that have a
    deep impact on the life of our group and of its
    stakeholders. our wish is for readers to have a
    pleasant journey that at the same time will make
    them reflect, help them interpret the economy and
    society with a more informed and aware attitude,
    and make them feel surprised that a generali
    group report can be much more than a simple
    report.

the integrated overview of our reports
in recent years, the generali group reports were prepared from different
perspectives: financial, sustainability, governance and remuneration.
in 2016, we embarked upon a new path inspired by the innovative concept
of integrated thinking and reporting. the functions responsible for the group
reports have established the integrated lab with the objective of further
developing integrated reporting to describe the group’s value creation
process from different perspectives, within a coherent framework in terms of
content and graphics.

our history
                           since 1831 we are an italian, independent
                           group, with a strong international presence.
                           we are one of the largest global players in the
                           insurance industry, a strategic and highly relevant
                           sector for the growth, development and welfare
                           of modern companies.
                           in almost 200 years we have built a group that
                           operates in over 60 countries through more than
                           420 companies and almost 74 thousand employees.
                           our history, which has developed hand-in-hand
                           with that of society, is a long tale packed with social,
                           industrial and commercial innovations.
                           the group was established as assicurazioni generali austro - italiche in trieste,
                 1831      that was the ideal choice at the time as a commercial and international hub located
                           in the main port of the austro - hungarian empire

                           generali began the reclamation of ca’ corniani farm (venice) which was later home
                 1851      to the telegraph office, the school, the children’s garden and the homes for the
                           labourers. in 2009 the farm became a centre for the production of electricity from
                           biomass

                           the first issues of mittheilungen and il bollettino, company magazines in german
     1880 – 1893           and italian for employees, were released

                           the accident and hail insurance business lines were launched
     1881 – 1890
                           a machine distributing accident insurance policies for railway travellers was
                 1898      installed in termini station in rome

                           the first life insurance policy was issued for the italian minister of industry
                 1913
                           together with its employees, generali made a financial contribution to the
                 1951      reconstruction process following the flood in polesine (italy) and housed 100
                           children of 6-12 years of age from the flooded areas in its farming complex

                           generali was the first group to sell insurance
                 1994      products over the phone in italy, later also
                           expanding to include online sales

                           the first group sustainability report
                 2005      was published

                           generali was included in the mit technology
     2015 – 2017           review’s list of the 50 smartest companies
                           on the planet in 2015. it has been included
                           in the corporate knights’ global 100 most

our material issues
in 2014 we launched a process to identify the megatrends and material
issues - i.e. the topics of genuine importance - for us and our stakeholders,
embarking on a dialogue with our top management and with external
stakeholders, chosen for their authority and knowledge of the insurance
sector or for their ability to provide original and innovative perspectives.

focus on the governance of sustainability
the corporate governance, social and environmental sustainability committee performs a consultative, recommendatory
and preparatory role in favour of the board regarding the decisions to be taken with respect to the structure of corporate
governance rules and social and environmental sustainability issues. it is made up of non-executive directors, most of whom
are independent.

responsibility for sustainability at group level is attributed to the group ceo, who is charged with implementing the
strategies and policies established by the board of directors.

at group head office level, specific bodies and dedicated functions have also been established to ensure we systematically
take into account social and environmental aspects related to business activities, as well as economic ones:

        seeking capital and strategic agreements with large enterprises to
        finance their growth and international expansion phase.

                       we have already implemented a number of targeted or structural actions which have
                       improved the operations of our distributors.

                       following the actions taken, satisfaction levels rose and the number of detractors decreased
                       within our networks, an important factor in increasing their loyalty towards the group.

                       within our distribution networks, we specifically worked with our agents - who represent
                       one of the group’s major strengths - in order to improve the tools provided to them and
                       to increase their skills, taking into account customer evolution and new digital interaction

           after successfully completing the largest integration plan in the insurance industry in europe, generali italia has
           entered the second phase of development to become the market leader with the best customer experience. the
           core of this new phase is based on setting up a three year simplification programme (2016-2018) which completely
           redefines the processes that have a greater impact on the relationship with clients and agents. the simplification
           plan was presented to 4,500 agents and consultants gathered in rome for the first time together, after completion
           of the integration, on a day that also launched a new way of organising conventions.

           semplicemente generali italia was a participatory event where the plenary session was followed by activities
           focused on gaining knowledge, sharing and exploring 16 thematic areas and by a number of ted talk-based
           meetings. simplification in customer relations and the creation of new simpler and faster processes enable more
           than 12,000 generali italia insurance consultants to focus on analysing client needs, on building an offer tailored to
           their habits and on offering more innovative and accessible post-sales and assistance services. a simpler, smarter.
           faster approach is based on the co-design with clients and agents. it envisages a new way of working inside the
           company with the active involvement of both clients and agents during all stages, through focus groups, tests and
           simulations.




                       european legislation has provided for greater transparency with regard to remuneration, the
                       transparency of information provided to customers, relationships with distributors, and the
                       management and monitoring of both new and existing products.

                       in order to respond to the new challenges from the legislation, we launched the lisa listen,
                       advise project, based on the concept of customer centricity. lisa is a training programme
                       that involves our agents and business units, and is based on the following vision - “help me
                       today and support me always: let’s build long-term trust by defining effective solutions during
                       the entire relationship and taking care to add value to our clients’ lifestyle”.

                       we are working with our distributors and managers to acquire a more consulting-based
                       approach as to interpret the clients’ needs and take their perspective. this approach is also
                       a response to the market’s delicate situation, especially as regards unit-linked and protection
                       products which require high levels of information and consulting. the first pilot project was
                       launched in germany, italy and slovakia, involving 300 agents.

                       and shared rules.
                       these relations also allow us to create a

                       to employment and to the development of our

                       the process of identifying and selecting
over 40 thousand       suppliers is based on principles of free
suppliers*             competition and transparency, and is
                       aimed at ensuring the high quality of

                       assessment and qualification of
                       partners. the project is divided into
                       two phases and will initially involve our

                       group head office). in defining the
                       processes, we worked transversally
                       with the departments in order to
                       identify the most effective assessment
                       systems able to combine impacts,                         the portal was also integrated with

      emergency interventions


     in case of catastrophic events such as floods and earthquakes,
     we act as insurers, by setting up dedicated channels and preferential
     procedures for the claims settlement, and we also provide financial
     and material help to the populations affected.



                 in 2016, italy was hit by a number of earthquakes that
                 devastated some of its central regions, highlighting once

                 take place.

                 in response to this tragedy, the group immediately took
                 action on multiple fronts, firstly by suspending, extending

                 clients affected by the earthquake, and also by cancelling

           in 2016:

           ■ the farragut building in washington dc
           received leed platinum certification for its
           efficient use of resources, after having obtained
           the leed gold certificate in 2012. these
           recognitions are even more significant if we
           consider the age of the building (1961) and its
           complex management (over 30 tenants).

           the main improvements implemented by the team
           of generali engineers regarded the cooling system
           with the installation of new chillers, an innovative
           approach to daily energy management and with
           continuous adjustments determined by weather
           conditions, interventions on the lighting system
           with the installation of sensors and led lights and
           on the hydraulic system to minimise consumption.

                                                                  were installed in the common parts of the property.




           ■ the building in place de l’opéra 4 in paris,
           one of the most prestigious properties of
           generali’s real estate assets built in haussman
           style, obtained hqe exploitation certification for
           the degree of sustainability achieved.
           after its purchase in 2013, gre renovated the
           building to achieve the highest sustainability
           standards, both as regards the building’s
           structural part and the management of energy
           consumption. the tenants of the property were
           made aware of and actively involved in adopting
           the environmental performance improvements.

           despite some regulatory restrictions on historic
           buildings, the results were comparable to the
           standards of new buildings, with an overall limited
           investment compared to the property’s market
           value.

                                   since 2015, our new corporate website generali.com has had a more agile and
                                   modern layout, a significant focus on the visual approach, a broader range
                                   of content on topics of international interest and a specific focus on the most
                                   interesting news about the group.

                                   the website was designed to be viewed on any device and developed based on
                                   the group’s web guidelines, which also meet the international standards defined
                                   by the web accessibility initiative (wai).
