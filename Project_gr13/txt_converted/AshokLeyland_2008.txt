been to produce vehicles that are eco-friendly, pioneer the research and development of alternative fuels, provide

csr is a way of life at the driver training centres. for
example, ashok leyland has rented a small two-room
space for the alcoholics anonymous group to conduct
alcohol rehabilitation programme for truck drivers and
their families - a gap identiﬁed by ashok leyland to com-
plete the comprehensiveness of driver outreach in nam-
akkal.
awareness programme on hiv prevention and manage-
ment is being conducted for convoy drivers at the manu-
facturing units on a continuing basis.
a holistic health outreach programme for truck drivers,
arogya, was rolled out this year. implemented along with
a dealer in andhra pradesh, the csr initiative began its
ﬁrst component of arogya by conducting comprehensive
health outreach camps for drivers in four major trucking
centres in andhra pradesh. while the ﬁrst component
would continue, the second component of arogya –
setting up a permanent health outreach centre within
the dealer service centre – is in an advanced stage of
formulation.
