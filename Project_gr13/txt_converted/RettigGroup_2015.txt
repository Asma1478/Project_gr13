          10   11   12   13   14       the rotor sails operate based on the magnus effect: when wind
                                   meets the spinning rotor sail, it accelerates air flow on one side of
                                   the rotor sail and restricts the air flow on the opposite side of the
                                   rotor sail. the resulting difference in pressure creates a force that is
                                   perpendicular to the wind flow direction – a lift force. the circulatory
                                   flow, created here by the skin friction, is the same phenomenon that
