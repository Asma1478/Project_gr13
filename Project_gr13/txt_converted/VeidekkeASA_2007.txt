veidekke has long traditions of social responsibility
and community building. this is an integral part
of our corporate culture and part of what has
made veidekke into one of scandinavia’s leading
construction and property development compa-
nies today. it is our expressed ambition to manage
all our operations responsibly, professionally and
with consideration. in this way we will work
towards our corporate vision of creating a better
future for people at all stages of life. .

veidekke is a scandinavian construction and property deve-                                  much of veidekke’s growth and development has been

about this report .
many of the day-to-day operations in a company like veidekke are concerned with social responsibility in
practice. our core operations include the development and building of houses, offices, hotels, roads, brid-
ges, tunnels and railways. we pave, operate and maintain kilometre upon kilometre of public roads. we
have about a thousand ongoing projects in different parts of scandinavia at any one time. clearly, there
are many people who are affected in one way or another by our operations – because they live next door
to a building site, or because they are clients or employees, or politicians who make decisions at local or
central level about our future projects. no matter what processes we implement at veidekke, we must
never forget the people who are affected by our operations. our commitment to corporate social respon-
sibility will always be reflected in the way we manage the group, and it is therefore rooted in our basic
values: to be professional, honest, enthusiastic and ground-breaking.

we have also set four primary objectives for our endeavours to ensure responsible operations in all parts
of our organisation. we will always:

+ run a healthy and profitable business
+ live up to society’s and veidekke’s own ethical standards
+ have an open dialogue and maintain good relations with the world outside the company
+ be open and proactive with regard to problems and incidents

we will live up to these standards – whatever the project or task in hand.

this is veidekke’s first separate report on corporate social responsibility. it starts with a review of our con-
tact with stakeholders and interest groups. this is followed by reports on our economic, social and envi-
ronmental performance. in this we have been inspired by the internationally recognised global reporting
initiative (gri). we have not, however, included all the recommended themes but have selected only the
ones we regard as relevant to our core operations.

the social and environmental indicators have a dominant place in this year's report, but we plan to report
more fully on economic performance in coming years.

employees as co-owners
veidekke’s goal is that 50 per cent of the employees
own shares in the company. today, 36 per cent of
the employees have shares.


injuries on the building site
we have set a clear target to achieve an injury rate lower than 5 for
all our scandinavian operations by 2010. in 2006, the injury rate
(number of injuries per million hours worked) was 5.7 compared with
9.3 the year before.



recruitment
in the past year veidekke has recruited 753 new employees. we have a
turnover of 5.4 per cent among the salaried staff and 9.1 per cent among
the skilled workers. we have given much attention to recruiting new
employees, and we have e.g. 262 apprentices in our company.

         people to work longer, veidekke’s initiative has been de-
         scribed as the ideal solution. this is a typical win-win situ-
         ation. good for the employees, who are encouraged to
         work longer although they could have taken early retire-
         ment with a pension, and good for veidekke who can
         keep valuable manpower at a time when the industry is
         suffering from a shortage of qualified workers. and it is
         also good for the community, which benefits both from
         more value creation and better adjusted elderly members.
         in short, it benefits everyone.

         this is veidekke’s first separate report on corporate social
         responsibility. we have been working on this theme for
         many years, but have never set it down systematically
         between two covers before now. as this report shows,
         we have made good headway, but there are still many
         challenges ahead. we have a particular interest in ensu-
         ring steady recruitment to an industry which has had an
         urgent need for employees for years. it is also our aim to
         increase employee involvement, both with the help of
         processes to improve interaction on the construction site
         and by encouraging employees to purchase shares.
         moreover, we have set ambitious targets for the further
         reduction of injuries in our workplaces. these are three of
         the most important elements of our commitment to so-
         cial responsibility in the years ahead. at veidekke, we see
         a direct connection between corporate social responsibili-
         ty and our four key value drivers: close interaction with
         customers and other stakeholders, employee involve-
         ment, a decentralised organisation and good project con-
         trol. thus csr also acts as a key driver in our work to
         achieve our primary objective, which is to improve profit-
         ability in the group and strengthen our scandinavian
         position.

promoting an open and constructive dialogue with our
stakeholders and interest groups is an important part of
our business philosophy.
                   the business of running our operations brings us into con-          dialogue with our stakeholders, we make it
                   tact with a wide range of stakeholders: employees, custo-           easier to locate, monitor and solve poten-
