reducing sustainability risk
we manage sustainability risks as part of our overall risk management strategy. to see how these fit within our most significant business risks, see the risk
factors included in our form 10-k and 10-q filings with the u.s. securities and exchange commission. we cannot guarantee that even the most exhaustive
efforts will fully mitigate or prevent impact on our business success.
the table below outlines our top sustainability risk areas and how we manage them.

leading in value-based healthcare
traditional healthcare systems are based on payments for products and
services rather than results. this can lead to rising healthcare costs and
suboptimal patient outcomes. we advocate for a value-based healthcare
(vbhc) system, in which payment is based on the ability of products and
services to improve patient outcomes relative to their cost.
our current vbhc offerings fall under three categories: therapy
optimization, episodic bundles, and chronic care management. for more
information about our vbhc strategy and approach, see economic value.

   in fy17, pas interventions resulted in the development of a tool to
   identify patient groups needing better access in kazakhstan as well
   as improved clinician capacity at a facility in australia.
§§ partnership with the world stroke organization (wso). through
   our continued partnership with the wso, we developed new programs
   focused on increasing stroke awareness among patients and healthcare
   professionals. we sponsored the wso road map for quality stroke
   care, which provides guidance on stroke care for local healthcare
   providers and clinical groups. we also collaborated with the wso on
   the delivery of awareness-raising activities in china and india.

non-gaap
financial measures


this report contains financial measures, including free cash flow figures (defined as operating cash flows less property,
plant, and equipment additions), revenue growth rates, and diluted eps figures on a constant currency basis and as
adjusted for the extra week in fiscal year 2016. constant currency growth measures the change in revenue between
current and prior year periods using average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior year period. these
figures are “non-gaap” financial measures under applicable sec rules and regulations.
management believes that referring to constant currency growth rates is a useful way to evaluate the underlying
performance of medtronic’s sales. medtronic generally uses non-gaap financial measures to facilitate management’s
review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning. non-gaap financial
measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the company’s definition of these non-gaap measures may not
be the same or similar to measures presented by other companies.
non-gaap financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the company’s reported results
of operations. therefore, management strongly encourages investors to review the company’s consolidated financial
statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.

    primarily related to u.s. income tax expense resulting from the company’s completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain legacy covidien businesses that reduced the cash and investments held by medtronic’s

**** due to its 52/53 week fiscal year calendar, the company had an additional selling week in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. while it is difficult to calculate an exact impact from the extra week, the company estimates an $0.08
to $0.10 benefit to non-gaap diluted earnings per share (eps) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. the company estimates that, adjusting for the extra week, non-gaap earnings, diluted eps, and operating margin increases were
approximately 8 to 9 percent, approximately 11 to 12 percent, and approximately 1 percent, respectively, on a constant currency, constant week basis when compared to the prior fiscal year.

  constant currency growth, a non-gaap financial measure, measures the change in revenue between current and prior year periods using average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior year period.
** fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year, with the extra week included in the first quarter results. while it is difficult to calculate the impact of the extra week, the company estimates that the extra week impact on worldwide, fiscal year 2016
first quarter revenue was approximately $450 million. excluding the approximately $450 million from fy16 total revenue would result in approximately 5 percent overall growth and low double digit emerging markets growth, in each case on
a constant currency, constant week basis.
