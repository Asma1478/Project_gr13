hitachi’s approach

                             as a global company, we share our stakeholders’ values and pursue
                             sustainable growth by integrating management strategies and csr.
                             we align our csr activities with our mid-term management plan to realize
                             the hitachi group vision, creating both social and economic value.



                              trends in society and hitachi group identity

                             society is today undergoing great changes and faces a range of challenges, from
                             environmental issues and natural resource and energy constraints to poverty, inequality in
                             education, diseases, and population concentration in cities. hitachi’s corporate credo is to
                             contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products.
                             we created our group vision in may 2013, at the start of the 2015 mid-term management
                             plan, with the aims of delivering innovations that help to answer society’s challenges and of
                             building a safe, secure, comfortable, and fair society.
                                     the group vision indicates the path to the next stage of growth. we draw on the
                             ethics and values that hitachi has developed over the past 100 years—encapsulated in
                             our corporate credo and founding spirit—while continuously considering the next
                             generation. we look ahead to the longer term, while promoting corporate activities
                             informed by sensitivity to the needs of a changing society. our mid-term management plan
                             is the action plan we define to realize this vision; by integrating our management and csr
                             strategies, we seek to enhance the effectiveness of this approach.
                                     the implementation of our plan is a way for us to fulfill our responsibilities as a good
                             corporate citizen by promoting social innovation business, and with robust, diverse
                             governance and a pioneering spirit and a strong ethical stance for our employees. we also
                             comply with national laws and work in line with the hitachi group codes of conduct.
                                     in our 2015 mid-term management plan, we have set a target for our overseas
                             revenue ratio of over 50% and expanded our social innovation business in the global
                             market. to further accelerate global growth in fiscal 2015, the last year of the plan, on april
                             1, 2015, we appointed chief executives who will function as representatives of the hitachi
                             group in interactions with regional societies and customers in four global regions: in the
                             americas, in china, in the asia-pacific, and in europe, the middle east, africa, and the
                             commonwealth of independent states (emea/cis). they will transition hitachi’s worldwide
                             operations to an “autonomous decentralized global management” structure in which each
                             region, including japan, leads its business autonomously, maintaining a global outlook
                             while finding solutions to local issues.
                                     we are expanding the social innovation business globally to successfully complete
                             the 2015 mid-term management plan and achieve growth prior to its completion.

hitachi: creating new value for society together with our customers

humanity today is buffeted by dramatic change. we must tackle deep-reaching issues that impact our society on a global
scale: energy and environmental problems, water-related issues, population explosions, increasing poverty, and the graying
of societies. companies are called upon to work with diverse stakeholders to find the solutions our society needs.
technological innovation built on advanced it is coming to play an ever-greater role in addressing these issues.
     since its foundation, hitachi has aspired in its business activities to fulfill its mission: to contribute to society through the
development of superior, original technology and products. today we remain committed to this mission. by integrating the
infrastructural and information technologies we have created during our years of experience, we provide new solutions in
areas like transportation and energy systems and water supply systems using our desalination technology. these areas
represent our social innovation business, through which we seek to contribute to solutions to the global issues we all face.

collaborative creation with our customers
the social issues that we seek to address through our social innovation business are growing more complex all the time, and
there are considerable differences in the needs of our customers and of societies in various countries and regions. to
accurately and swiftly grasp the nature of the problems facing our customers and these societies, we must position ourselves
close to the customers and consider the needed solutions together with them. hitachi believes that this “collaborative creation”
is a key way to approach the issues. as our social innovation business expands worldwide, to advance collaborative creation
we must foster mutual trust with national and regional governments, local communities, academic societies, nongovernmental
organizations, and other stakeholders and address their respective needs surely and reliably.
      at hitachi, we are working to promote diversity from perspectives including gender, nationality, and values—all the
aspects of each person’s individuality. we are also striving to secure the human resources prepared to shine on the global
stage. in these ways we seek to foster global leaders who can drive our innovation into the future. we furthermore strive to
share the principles of “basics and ethics,” the foundation of our corporate philosophy, with all our stakeholders. this goes
beyond dedication to corporate ethics, such as compliance with laws and international social standards, to encompass our
business activities that aim to enhance our value as a company.
      in addition to raising our economic value as a company, we work together with our customers to create things of true
value to society. in this way we pursue a safer, more secure, more comfortable society for people around the world.

hitachi, ltd.                                 hitachi collaborates with customers in identifying issues of importance and thinking
                                      about ways to resolve them. communication with customers and our diverse stakeholders
                                      is an effective means of grasping the expectations of global society as we determine
                                      hitachi’s business policies from a csr perspective.
                                              in the area of csr, we formulated the hitachi group human rights policy in fiscal
                                      2013 and put it into effect in fiscal 2014. with the aim of understanding the effects of our
                                      business on human rights on a group-wide basis, we worked together with npos and
                                      hitachi group companies to prepare the human rights due diligence guidance, which is
                                      now being shared within the group.
                                              in the environmental field, we are conducting the hitachi global lights-off campaign
                                      at 234 locations in 23 countries worldwide. in the coming years we intend to continue
                                      such global efforts together with hitachi group employees and local societies. our
                                      environmental action plan for 2013–15 has played a role in moving toward sustainability for
                                      society, and we are now working to develop a new action plan to succeed it.
                                              at hitachi we will continue to conduct our business in a way that reflects the
                                      expectations of society, as seen through communication with stakeholders, and, by
                                      disclosing information on measures and outcomes, to achieve corporate management with
hitachi global lights-off campaign    a high level of transparency.

hitachi, ltd.
                                         terms of csr, we continually implement csr monitoring (self-checks) and external audits
                                         of suppliers from china and other asian countries.
                                                 at the same time, while we have 25 international procurement offices, the actual task
                                         of placing orders has been consolidated into a professional service company in the hitachi
                                         group that focuses on key operations like selecting reliable business partners and taking a
                                         globally coordinated approach to purchasing, thus ensuring that each region can add
                                         value in an autonomous fashion.
                                                 moreover, to make full use of the information held by the hitachi group, we have built
                                         a database of suppliers, registering reliable business partners and sharing information on
                                         them. this has not only resulted in reduced costs through the expansion of local
                                         procurement but also mitigated supply-chain risks, including those related to csr.
                                                 to ensure the steady implementation of these initiatives, we are developing and
                                         reinforcing our global procurement human resources by enhancing various e-learning
                                         materials and opportunities for on-the-job training. we encourage all procurement
                                         personnel to take on various new challenges so they can better understand the
                                         importance of maintaining a competitive edge from a global perspective.

transformation project initiatives division
hitachi, ltd.                                 made in recent years is the success of our efforts in japan to maximize the potential of
                                              female employees, as corroborated by the recognition we have received in external
                                              assessments. in july 2014, hitachi chairman emeritus takashi kawamura received the
                                              prime minister’s commendation for efforts toward the formation of a gender-equal
                                              society, and in march 2015, the ministry of economy, trade, and industry and the tokyo

                                                      opportunities for non-japanese human capital are also expanding, as seen in hitachi,
                                              ltd.’s appointment of two foreign executive officers in april 2015. we will continue to
                                              promote diversity and inclusion in the future as we accelerate our efforts to achieve an
                                              “autonomous decentralized global management” structure.
                                                      since fiscal 2013 we have been conducting a group survey called hitachi insights,
                                              based on which we are making ongoing workplace improvements worldwide. the survey
                                              was distributed to 194,000 employees in fiscal 2014, and the survey results confirmed that
                                              improvements are being made in a variety of areas.
                                                      in fiscal 2015 we will push forward with our global human capital management
                                              strategy and continue creating workplace environments that maximize the potential of
                                              our diverse human capital so we may grow both individually as employees and

                                   achieving a sustainable society. successful delivery of social innovation requires
                                   integration of a wide range of stakeholders. in europe, we engage in relevant policy
                                   discussions with and capture the expectations of our local stakeholders. working with
                                   trusted partners including csr europe, we discuss salient social innovation and

                                   united kingdom hosted by the guardian in november. it is apparent that healthcare
                                   systems not only require ongoing technology innovation but are also becoming more
                                   patient centric. therefore, hitachi’s big data research laboratory, which recently opened
                                   in copenhagen, will—in collaboration with bispebjerg and frederiksberg university
                                   hospital—conduct studies to develop new healthcare solutions.
                                           to support our investments in european infrastructure, hitachi is partnering with local
                                   and national education institutions. hitachi rail europe recently announced its
                                   collaboration with the university of sunderland and a local company, gestamp tallent

                                           social innovation will be measured by its positive impact on society. it’s not just about

                                             hitachi’s approach to corporate social responsibility reflects these principles. we

                                              we at hitachi recognize our responsibility to contribute to solving society’s challenges
                                      through our social innovation business. we have made significant achievements and
                                      progress so far in such areas as transportation, urban development, and water treatment
                                      to meet the needs of our diverse markets. regarding the environment, we strive to do
                                      more than just save energy in our factories. we have installed information technology
                                      systems and equipment to track overall energy use and promote responsible energy
                                      management in our customers’ offices, hotels, shopping malls, hospitals, and

                                      optimizes the total consumption of energy.
                                              as our contribution to society, hitachi has sponsored four-year scholarships to three
                                      students attending the asian university for women. hitachi has also been operating such

                                      scholarship program. we remain strongly aware of the significance and necessity of

               we will press ahead with our csr activities in china
               from a broad perspective, including daily business
               operations and volunteer activities as part of efforts to

kenichi kokubo                          china is currently transitioning from its period of high economic growth, which served as an engine for
vice president and executive officer;   the global economy, to a “new normal” set forth by the government that places an increasing
chief executive for china
hitachi, ltd.                           emphasis on environmental problems and low carbon energy. under this transition, particular focus is
                                        placed on the condition of air, water, and other essential resources.
                                                as hitachi aims to grow and develop together with chinese society, we need to accurately
                                        understand local needs, including a growing awareness of environmental preservation. by combining
                                        our strengths in infrastructure technology and it, we believe we can play a crucial role in solving these
                                        issues through our contributions to realizing a low-carbon economy.
                                                in june 2014, we conducted the “hitachi group china business strategy comprehensive
                                        activities 2014” in beijing to share the goal of unifying the management of the hitachi group
                                        companies in china and to set the future direction for our business in this country. in addition to a
                                        chinese business strategy conference that brought together more than 300 hitachi executives, the
                                        activities included a technology exchange meeting with the national development and reform
                                        commission drawing 350 participants and a press conference for the major chinese media. all of the
                                        activities were a great success.
                                                while the success internally and externally showcased our strong determination to contribute to
                                        the development of chinese society, it has also brought together the 180 hitachi group companies in
                                        china and fostered our approach as well as our mind in the same direction.
                                                we also have to understand that compliance is another very important factor for hitachi to
                                        develop its business in china. to continue our business activities responsibly in chinese society, it is a
                                        must for each of our business partners to carry out its own social responsibilities.
                                                as one of hitachi’s efforts for compliance, the company conducts supplier audits every year. in
                                        fiscal 2014 we audited about 20 suppliers, scrutinizing their compliance with regulations related to the
                                        environment, human rights, and safety and health. we will continue these audits and are committed
                                        to fulfilling our social responsibilities together with our suppliers in china.
                                                hitachi also carries out a variety of activities for the benefit of china’s society. last year, 2014,
                                        was the third year of the hitachi eco education classroom program, an original csr activity of
                                        hitachi group companies in china. over these three years, approximately 3,000 elementary students
                                        have participated in this program, which was highly regarded by schoolteachers.
                                                at hitachi hope elementary school, a school supported by hitachi, the hitachi eco education
                                        classroom program was conducted. there we also replaced blackboards in all classrooms to
                                        improve the school environment for students to enjoy their studies. we also continued to nurture
                                        children through efforts including support for rebuilding a school affected by the earthquake that
                                        struck yunnan province in august 2014.
                                                in fiscal 2015, hitachi introduced its “autonomous decentralized global management,” which has
                                        been promoted globally. as the head of the hitachi group companies in china, i consider my office as
                                        the “control tower” for the region as we work closely with customers to solve the issues they face.
                                        this approach applies to all our csr and social contribution activities; we are committed to
                                        proactively taking initiatives based on a csr perspective, recognizing the high expectations people
                                        have of hitachi.

energy solutions

                             providing stable, sustainable power to meet rising electricity demand


                                social issues involving energy infrastructure




                               the northeast blackout of august 2003 dealt a heavy economic blow to the united states. (new york city)




                               electricity is a vital lifeline that supports virtually all economic activities and has become essential
                               to the lives of people in modern society. with the urbanization and growing populations of
                               emerging countries, global demand for electricity is expected to continue rising.
                                       in energy-dependent modern societies, any stoppage in the electricity supply can halt
                               the functioning of much of our social infrastructure, including medical, transportation, and
                               government services. problems in recent years include the aging and degradation of
                               electric grid facilities in developed countries and the ongoing chronic power shortages in
                               emerging countries. in all parts of the world, the effects of small-scale transmission failures
                               can give rise to stoppages that affect electric power plants over wider areas. infrastructure
                               maintenance and development for the transmission and distribution of electricity, as well as
                               for generation itself, are urgent tasks for a stable supply of power.
                                       increasing carbon emissions with global economic development are also a concern as
                               global warming progresses. serious problems resulting from this atmospheric warming
                               include torrential rainfall, cold spells and other abnormal weather patterns, rising sea
                               levels, floods, and food shortages. to slow the progress of global warming, there are calls
                               to limit the use of energy obtained from the fossil fuels that are a source of carbon
                               emissions and to expand the use of renewable energy produced by wind and solar power.
                               one of the drawbacks of these types of renewable energy, however, is the large variability
                               in energy produced depending on weather conditions. introduction of this energy on a
                               large scale, which may cause fluctuations in power output, will require solutions to
                               overcome the issue of power grid instability.

                              hitachi’s approach

                             integrated generation/transmission and distribution systems for stable
                             electricity supply

                             in balancing the needs for a smaller environmental burden and a stable electricity supply,
                             both more widespread use of renewable sources for power generation and development of
                             an infrastructure for stable transmission and distribution are essential for the energy
                             infrastructure that supplies electricity.
                                     however, energy infrastructure circumstances differ by country and region. in
                             emerging countries, building infrastructure to provide a stable electricity supply is the main
                             issue in meeting the growing demand for electric power. as energy infrastructure expands,
                             the need for greater use of renewable energy is also growing in response to concerns
                             about air pollution and global warming. in the united states and some european countries,
                             which are pushing energy market liberalization, challenges include dealing with aging
                             social infrastructure and maintaining a stable electricity supply as more renewable energy
                             comes on line. in japan, where electricity system reform is underway, the accelerating use
                             of renewable energy is bringing about growing needs for grid stabilization and energy
                             storage solutions.
                                     resolution of these various issues requires understanding of the problems faced by
                             societies and customers, as well as collaboration with customers to find solutions. hitachi
                             provides total energy solutions for a stable electricity supply while meeting various needs
                             by taking advantage of its wide-ranging experience and technologies in the energy field,
                             from generation to transmission, storage, distribution, and energy management.
                                     one such area is wide-area grid stability solutions. the effects of power outages in
                             modern societies are immeasurable. preventing large-scale outages and providing a stable
                             supply of electricity requires the development of grids with robust transmission and
                             distribution capabilities. hitachi provides solutions using the latest it while responding to
                             the different usage conditions in each part of the world.
                                     the introduction of renewable energy on a large scale will be an essential part of next-
                             generation, sustainable energy infrastructure that supports comfortable, convenient lives.
                             the massive earthquake that struck northeastern japan in 2011 highlighted problems in
                             the nation’s energy supply and led to calls for the introduction of more autonomous,
                             decentralized energy systems. these systems would utilize more renewable energy for
                             greater resistance to disasters and have smaller environmental impacts. hitachi is working
                             to develop basic technology to improve the reliability and competitiveness of wind and
                             solar power generation. we are trying to make renewable energy more commercially
                             viable, starting with the world’s first floating offshore wind farm. other efforts are in the
                             areas of energy storage solutions to maintain the power supply-demand balance when
                             renewable energy is introduced on a large scale and “smart grids,” next-generation power
                             supply networks that use it to control the amount of demand on a system to match the
                             power generated.
                                     since hitachi’s foundation, the company has contributed to constructing energy
                             infrastructure in countries worldwide, with exports to 67 countries and deployment of
                             energy solutions businesses in north america, europe, and elsewhere.

                              case 1: storage solutions for stable renewable energy: “crystena”

                             power generation systems using renewable energy sources like wind and solar have been
                             spreading in recent years. with renewable energy, however, the power output fluctuates
                             depending on weather and other conditions, and disturbances in voltage, current, and
                             frequency can affect entire power systems, decreasing the quality of electricity or leading
                             to major blackouts. balancing supply and demand, such as the need to limit generation
                             during times with little demand, is therefore essential. energy storage systems are eyed as
                             one solution to overcome this issue. hitachi has a strong record in producing energy
                             storage system devices and many types of battery—for general consumers, industry, and
                             automobiles—and is conducting wide-ranging efforts for better energy storage solutions,
                             from research and development to construction, installation, maintenance, and operation
                             of its crystena*1 storage systems.
                             *1 crystena: the name was created by combining the “crystallization” of state-of-the-art technologies in the hitachi
                                group and “energy.”



                             hitachi’s all-in-one container-type energy storage system
                             the united states has taken steps to increase the use of renewable energy by opening the
                             power transmission networks and liberalizing electricity retailing, and its wind and solar
                             power generation are among the top in the world. with the growing adoption of renewable
                             energy, however, there is concern about instability in the electricity supply. this has given
                             rise to business opportunities in ancillary services (system operation services provided by
                             power system operators to maintain the quality of electric power) as a market, in which the
                             adjusting capacity for stabilizing electric power itself can be traded.
                                     hitachi has developed an all-in-one package system to help stabilize power systems
                             by storing large amounts of electricity. a demonstration project was begun in new jersey
                             in february 2015. it is the result of basic research in energy storage systems over many
                             years. it contains about 1,600 lithium-ion batteries capable of high power discharge and
                             more than 8,000 charge/discharge cycles. it is a complete system that includes a control
                             unit, power conditioning, and other systems all in one 40-foot container. the container
                             format helps to minimize installation work, setup time, and costs. it also means that a
                             large system can be configured by installing a number of units in tandem.
                                     hitachi has also developed a simulator that can predict battery life, using this to
                             estimate a service life of 10 years for this system. full safety measures also include
                             disconnection in the event of an emergency and an automatic fire-fighting system. in a
                             demonstration experiment, energy storage was shown to be useful in stabilizing power
                             systems by rapidly adjusting input and output in a matter of seconds in response to
                             frequency and voltage change signals, which vary over short time periods. further
                             verification results will be used in developing batteries that are more compact, less
                             expensive, and longer-lasting.

                             increase in input and output currents compared with hitachi’s conventional batteries) and
                             an anticipated extension of battery life to 20 years. it was connected to the izu oshima
                             power system in 2015 to test its peak shift response, ability to suppress short-period
                             fluctuations, and service life.
                                     other advanced technologies will be introduced at the same time, including a system
                             to simulate the effects when renewable energy is introduced and the best system
                             composition for stability. efforts are also underway to make the system suitable for islands
                             by using remote monitoring to improve operation and maintenance.


                              case 2: applying it in wide-area grid stability solution to prevent blackout

                             lightning strikes on power lines and other accidents can cause instantaneous voltage
                             drop, leading to power swings that cause fluctuations in voltage or current. if such swings
                             continue, the effects can extend to wider areas and in some cases result in major
                             blackouts. renewable wind or solar energy is susceptible to changes in output due to the
                             weather, and voltage, current, and frequency disturbances can decrease the quality of
                             electricity or cause major blackouts. hitachi provides total solutions for stable power
                             transmission, from energy generation, transmission, and distribution equipment to control
                             systems utilizing it, including monitoring control and grid stabilization.

                             online testing of new grid control system that prevents major outages
                             for more stable grids, improvements in electricity quality need to be achieved by constant
                             monitoring and control of electric flow during transmission. since 2012 hitachi has been
                             conducting joint research with the us department of energy’s bonneville power
                             administration (bpa) on a grid stabilization system that can adapt to the increasing use of
                             renewable energy. a demonstration project for the new system for grid control to prevent
                             major outages was started in october 2014.
                                     grid status has been monitored in the past by supervisory control and data
                             acquisition (scada) systems, but these systems can measure only voltage and current,
                             not phasors. the present system adopts phasor measurement units (pmus), which are
                             coming into widespread use in the united states. with real-time collection and analysis of
                             information on phase in addition to voltage and current, this system makes it possible to
                             formulate measures to prevent major power outages. although pmus are currently
                             spreading worldwide, their use is limited to grid status monitoring. hitachi is also
                             combining grid analysis technology and it with the aim of developing a new, integrated
                             stabilization system that overcomes issues in grid operation.

                             businesses. hitachi is using its technology and experience to design and
                             construct systems that stabilize the entire grid, from generation through
                             transmission and distribution.


                             smart grids to deal with aging infrastructure and renewable energy introduction
                             poland is increasing its wind power generation capacity to meet its ambitious targets of
                             supplying 15% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and 19% by 2030. at the
                             same time, the country must deal with aging infrastructure, more than half of which was
                             built more than 40 years ago. upgrading and enhancing energy infrastructure equipment
                             will require major capital investment and will impose significant management challenges. to
                             accelerate the use of renewable energy while minimizing capital investment, there is
                             growing interest in stabilization technology that can maintain reliable grid operation.
                                     hitachi has been selected by the new energy and industrial technology development
                             organization (nedo) as a partner in a smart grid demonstration project, which is one of nedo’s
                             demonstration projects of international energy consumption efficiency technology and systems,
                             in poland. by building on the grid stabilization technology that hitachi has developed over the
                             years, implementing new control techniques for the real-time curtailment of wind power output
                             and energy storage systems, the company aims to create grid stabilization systems for poland
                             that will help expand the country’s use of renewable energy, minimize its capital investment in
                             energy infrastructure, and maintain stability in its grid operations.

                              case 3: large-volume renewable energy from 5-mw offshore wind turbine

                             there is growing interest in renewable energy as a way to contribute to the prevention
                             of global warming. among the different types of renewable energy, wind power generation
                             is now reaching output and cost levels that are on a par with conventional power
                             generation using fossil fuels and nuclear power. these systems are growing in size and
                             sophistication worldwide.
                                     hitachi developed a 2-mw downwind turbine for use in japan’s demanding
                             conditions, such as typhoon gusts and wind turbulence in its mountainous regions.
                             hitachi’s htw2.0-80, a 2-mw wind power generation system, has been installed at many
                             sites and maintains a top share in japan. we are also participating in offshore floating wind
                             farm demonstration projects sponsored by agencies including the ministry of economy,
                             trade, and industry and the ministry of the environment. the first seven fixed-base
                             offshore wind turbines built in japan commenced operation in 2010, with an additional
                             eight turbines added in 2013.
                                     with this experience, hitachi has developed a 5-mw offshore wind turbine with
                             downwind rotor, the htw5.0-126. japan is surrounded by large areas of ocean; therefore,
                             there is much greater potential for wind power generation than on land. offshore wind
                             power generation has few restrictions with respect to siting, scenery effects, and noise,
                             but compared with land-based facilities, construction and operation costs are higher and
                             maintenance is difficult. this makes it necessary to develop offshore wind power
                             generation systems with high output per unit and high reliability.
                                     the htw5.0-126, which has recently been completed, meets needs for larger
                             turbines for the offshore wind farms expected to be built in the future. compared with
                             our previous 2-mw offering, this wind power generation system has a rated output of 5-mw,
                             about 2.5 times higher, and rotor diameter of 126 meters, about 1.5 times greater than
                             the previous system’s dimensions. the htw5.0-126 system uses a unique configuration
                             developed by hitachi with the rotor located on the downwind side of the tower. in this
                             configuration, the rotor is maintained in an orientation that does not receive crosswinds
                             during heavy storms—even the typhoons that frequently affect japan—thus serving to
                             reduce the wind load. moreover, with a new combination of a permanent magnet
                             synchronous generator and a medium-speed gearbox, hitachi decreased the weight
                             and size of the entire system with respect to output and improved reliability. it is also
                             expected to provide better safety and reduced costs of installing the seabed
                             foundations or floating platforms.
                                     hitachi will continue to build our business in the growing wind energy field, thereby
                             contributing to the creation of a low-carbon society.

                              future outlook

                             enriching lives worldwide with advanced energy infrastructure.
                             hitachi applies its it expertise to contribute to infrastructure providing a
                             stable electricity supply.

                             as renewable energy comes into greater use worldwide, a growing number of power
                             generation facilities are located in land areas or on the sea far from the cities in the
                             demand area. to secure stable power transmission over long distances, wide-area grid
                             stability solutions are essential. there is also a need to maintain the electricity supply even
                             when generation systems go down due to natural disasters or other causes by
                             interconnecting grids over a large area.
                                     in many countries, grid operators are pursuing more robust wide-area interconnection
                             with the aims of energy market liberalization and greater reliability. high-voltage direct
                             current (hvdc) transmission systems are being looked at as a stabilization solution for
                             long-distance transmission and wide-area interconnection. these are systems for
                             transmitting electricity between two different grids. electricity is converted to direct current
                             before transmission, reducing electricity losses, facility sizes, and construction costs. this
                             approach is also applicable to systems that cannot be connected directly with alternating
                             current because of different frequencies. hitachi has participated in all hvdc projects in
                             japan, contributing to the stabilization of the nation’s grids.
                                     with growing needs for hvdc in the japanese market, hitachi formed a joint venture
                             with swiss company abb, a leading power and automation group, in december 2014,
                             and signed a formal contract in june 2015 to provide new technology in a timely manner.
                             hitachi will provide abb’s latest technology to hvdc projects on which hitachi is the
                             prime contractor, taking full responsibility for all aspects of direct current (dc) systems,
                             from design to engineering and equipment supply as well as after-sales service. the

                                social issues surrounding transportation infrastructure




                               the london–brighton rail line runs atop england’s balcombe viaduct, completed in 1841.




                               around the world, more and more people are choosing to live in cities. in 2014, 54% of the
                               world’s population lived in urban areas. by 2050, 66% of the world’s population is
                               projected to be urban. as populations and economies grow around the world, humanity is
                               increasingly concentrating in urban centers of development. this presents an opportunity
                               for societies to create the right transport infrastructure to get people to where they need to
                               go more efficiently than ever before. creating this complex infrastructure is a challenge,
                               though, and many developing societies are lagging behind.
                                       by 2050, the world will see a major change in the makeup of the top 10 nations by gdp
                               size, as established industrial economies contract and emerging economies like india, brazil,
                               and indonesia continue to rise. in many of these growth regions, the development of mobility
                               infrastructure will be outstripped by the sheer speed of urbanization. as cities grow, they
                               invariably confront the issues of chronic road congestion and rising numbers of traffic
                               accidents, as well as worsening environmental problems due to transportation-related air
                               pollution. economies will be constrained by these cities’ limited ability to expand and move
                               people from a to b.
                                       infrastructure issues affect the developed world too. in addition to aging of their existing
                               infrastructure—only to be expected in countries that were leaders in introducing urban
                               transportation systems long ago—problems include the need for improvement and
                               rearrangement of these existing systems to address demographic shifts and changes to their
                               industrial base.
                                       hitachi offers solutions that help all these economies, developing and developed alike, to
                               keep their transportation infrastructure effective, efficient, and central to their continued growth.

                              hitachi’s approach

                             railway systems for sustainable cities and development

                             today every market around the globe is seeing rising demand for transportation of people
                             and goods, and for the systems that support it. a successful provider of infrastructure
                             solutions must have global reach to meet this demand. each market faces its own set of
                             issues, including economic factors, regulatory frameworks for safety and other matters,
                             and environmental concerns.
                                     hitachi is focused on the specific needs and concerns of its customers around the world,
                             identifying the issues that they face and developing the solutions that they demand. our aim is
                             to provide a tailored response to the issues faced by our customers in order to ensure
                             sustainable development of urban living environments, as well as to bring enhanced comfort
                             and convenience to the lives of the traveling public.
                                     hitachi’s railway systems provide a full array of products and services. as a leading rail
                             vehicle manufacturer, we produce the trains that connect the networks we serve. furthermore,
                             our traffic management system ensures optimal performance of the rail system as a whole while
                             ensuring reliable operation of each in-service train. rail is more than just a commodity. our aim
                             is to provide complete turnkey solutions for our target markets, encompassing the track and
                             rolling stock, traffic management systems to ensure that the complete network functions safely
                             and smoothly, and the train maintenance services that keep operating efficiency at peak levels.
                                     the core of hitachi’s expertise is the cutting-edge technologies that go into our trains.
                             most notably, these trains include the shinkansen, japan’s famously safe and efficient “bullet
                             trains.” the company has built an industry-leading track record for the traffic management
                             systems and mechanical reliability that underpin japan’s reputation for down-to-the-second
                             punctuality and a flawless operational safety record.
                                     at hitachi, safety is our number-one concern. our railway systems are designed
                             intelligently to isolate and minimize failures, so that any defects will have minimal or no impact
                             on the rest of the system. we set safety as our top key performance indicator—not just for
                             the products that we deliver, but also for our factories and all our other operations as well.
                             our dedication to safety ensures not just compliance with regulatory requirements in all the
                             markets that we serve, but also that we remain the vendor of choice for customers who know
                             that the lives and property of their customers come first.
                                     environmental and quality-of-life considerations are also key drivers of our technological
                             and systems innovation. years of hitachi research and development have produced train
                             vehicles that are lighter than ever while meeting safety requirements, make more use of
                             recycled materials, and operate more quietly. these innovations minimize the impact on both
                             passengers and communities living near the tracks. we are also a market leader in bi-mode/
                             hybrid systems that run on electricity where it is available and, where no electricity is available,
                             switch automatically to diesel or to batteries (charged by cutting-edge regeneration systems).
                             customers select rail solutions with the “whole-life approach” in mind, considering everything
                             from weight and carbon emissions to serviceability and seamless compatibility with
                             connected transportation networks. in this respect, hitachi is a world leader in the technical
                             integration of operation and signaling systems, providing expertise in all areas from urban light
                             rail to city connections and international high-speed railway networks.
                                     with our railway systems operations headquartered in the united kingdom, we are
                             uniquely positioned to offer globally minded solutions to markets around the world. we
                             currently conduct rail-related business in 32 countries, and as of fiscal 2014 we are operating
                             or providing rail systems to 28 countries worldwide.

                              case 1: renewing the united kingdom’s aging railway network

                             as the birthplace of the railway, the united kingdom has a long history of trains and rail
                             networks. this was part of the reason that hitachi chose to run its global railway systems
                             operations from a uk base. this will provide access to important markets in europe and
                             the middle east, and will serve as a platform for expanding our rail capacity globally.
                                     the united kingdom’s victorian rail infrastructure has been going through a period of
                             continuous upgrade and regeneration. in addition to an extensive program of electrification
                             and resignaling, stations, platforms, track, and bridges are all being renewed. this is to
                             ensure that the united kingdom’s railways remain a vital part of its economic activity for many
                             years to come.
                                     drawing on our technical expertise built up through work on japan’s high-speed
                             shinkansen “bullet trains” and other rail networks, hitachi is developing rail vehicles for the
                             united kingdom that flexibly respond to these infrastructure conditions. in developing rolling
                             stock for the british intercity express programme (iep), extending to swansea and plymouth
                             in the west and the major cities of scotland in the north, hitachi focuses primarily on safety
                             and environmental performance.
                                     we have introduced carefully tested safety measures that fully comply with european
                             regulations. safety is the primary key performance indicator for hitachi, not just in the rail
                             vehicles we build but also in our factories and all of our rail operations. it is also the most
                             important criterion for customers when they select a partner—and a key reason that hitachi
                             was chosen to upgrade and maintain the entire iep fleet in one of the largest rail projects in
                             british railway history.
                                     to keep the hitachi trains as environmentally friendly as possible, we have focused on
                             reducing the weight of the rail vehicles, improving their aerodynamic profile, and increasing
                             the percentage of recycled materials that goes into them. a quiet train is an energy-efficient
                             train: vehicle design that reduces rail noise and air resistance leads to lower carbon output
                             and operational costs. we are also achieving dramatically shortened travel times: journey time
                             on the london–ashford portion of the southeastern main line, for instance, has been
                             shortened from 80 minutes to 37 minutes.
                                     furthermore, hitachi is increasing energy efficiency through intelligent interior design, by
                             maximizing seating capacity without sacrificing passenger comfort. we are working closely
                             with the authorities and railway operators to ensure that these clever designs also conform
                             with universal design and other relevant regulations.
                                     a railway is more than just trains. hitachi is able to offer a complete package to iep
                             operators, including rolling stock, repair and maintenance, and it services allowing smart, fully
                             networked operation of the trains. our intelligent systems integrate route signaling and
                             onboard systems to let trains communicate with each other. by keeping track of where the
                             other trains are on the route, our trains can maintain a safe distance with less braking—which
                             in turn reduces energy loss.
                                     with its development of bi-mode trains allowing travel on both fully electrified lines and
                             under their own power, hitachi is providing flexible, adaptable systems with wide applicability.
                             our fully integrated approach to the rail business has proven a winning strategy in diversifying
                             the british transportation market.

                                     creating a thoroughly modern, reliable rail network is a fundamental stimulus to the
                             the british economy, and hitachi is proud to play a key role. the ashford train
                             maintenance centre, completed in 2007, and the new depots being readied for the iep’s
                             introduction, are hitachi’s primary centers for rollout and servicing of new rail vehicles for
                             british railways. we provide and create several hundred careers for skilled technicians, as
                             well as the trickle-down effect that boosts the local and national economy. with a similar
                             eye on the future of the british economy, we are sponsoring a university technical college
                             in newton aycliffe, where we will have our european train factory. scheduled to launch in
                             2016, this program will train up to 600 young people a year, filling a critical shortfall in

                              case 2: providing vietnam’s first urban railway

                             vietnam is in a period of sustained economic growth. the population of its largest city, ho
                             chi minh, is skyrocketing, leading to chronic and intense traffic congestion. with no public
                             transit facilities other than buses, many residents ride motorbikes or bicycles, and a rapid
                             increase in the number of automobiles in recent years has made a difficult road traffic
                             situation even worse. problems like traffic accidents and pollution are steadily worsening.
                                     to help protect the environment and provide a sweeping improvement to the traffic
                             situation, we are constructing line 1 of the ho chi minh urban rail network, which will be
                             vietnam’s very first urban railway with an underground section. hitachi earned high marks
                             for its ability to provide comprehensive railway solutions, winning a contract to provide 11
                             subsystems including the manufacture of rolling stock, signaling systems,
                             telecommunication systems, power supply systems, platform screen doors, ticket vending
                             machines and passenger gates, and depot facilities. hitachi will also provide maintenance
                             service on all of these systems for five years.
                                     once completed, the railway network will be run by an operation and maintenance
                             company to be established by ho chi minh city. however, it is unrealistic to expect local
                             staff to immediately take care of the maintenance of facilities like signaling systems, track,
                             and overhead contact systems. hitachi will transfer technology over the course of the
                             five-year maintenance contract, while also helping to foster human resources. given the
                             shortcomings in ho chi minh’s grid infrastructure, hitachi will give full consideration to
                             eco-friendly energy efficiency in its construction of electrical facilities, such as by installing
                             regenerative inverters.

                              case 3: easing congestion with a safe, convenient monorail system

                             traffic congestion in south korea is getting worse due to increased concentration of the
                             population in the capital of seoul and in other key cities, as well as a rise in the number of
                             automobiles on the roads. to address this problem, railway systems—which emit less co2
                             than automobiles on a per passenger basis—are being reevaluated, and plans for
                             introducing light rail networks such as monorails, with relatively low construction costs and
                             smaller environmental footprints, are proceeding in a number of cities.
                                     the city of daegu—the urban center of korea’s southeast region, boasting about 2.5
                             million residents—has been grappling with these same issues. the municipal government has
                             settled on a straddle-type monorail system as a means of preserving daegu’s environment of
                             rich greenery and rivers and reducing energy use. hitachi has a global record in providing
                             monorail solutions, starting with seven systems in japan including the tokyo monorail and
                             extending to systems in chongqing, china, and in dubai. daegu selected us for this project due
                             to our long record, as well as the high evaluations of our monorail technology and reliability.
                                     daegu metro line 3, korea’s first urban monorail system, runs nearly 24 kilometers from
                             the northwest to the southeast of the city, with 30 stations, and 84 cars in 28 train sets. it
                             uses a driverless operation system. as a provision for ensuring passenger wellbeing in the
                             event of an accident, one safety personnel member rides each train, and the cars are all
                             equipped with safety systems like fire sprinklers and evacuation equipment that makes it easy
                             for passengers to safely descend from the monorail cars. the monorail’s cutting-edge
                             technology also includes mist-glass windows in passenger compartments that automatically
                             turn opaque when the train runs through a residential area, thus ensuring the privacy of
                             homes along the line. this project is proactively employing korean products thanks to
                             collaboration with local corporations and hitachi korea.
                                     daegu metro line 3 began operation on april 23, 2015. in addition to improving access
                             to various facilities throughout the city, it is expected to have various spillover effects, such as
                             the monorail itself becoming a tourist attraction.

                              future outlook

                             hitachi aims to provide fully integrated rail transportation solutions to serve
                             and connect the “smart cities” of tomorrow.

                             looking forward, hitachi railway systems will continue advancing its technologies in all
                             areas: railway vehicle manufacturing, safety and environmental technologies that are
                             central to train functions, and intelligent networks that integrate trains with signaling
                             systems and railway operation centers. the company continues to prove itself in global
                             markets at all levels of the industry, providing high-speed and city-connecting rail solutions
                             as well as turnkey systems that meet fast-growing cities’ urban transportation needs.
                                     rail transport is a vital part of eco-friendly urban design, and this role will only continue
                             to grow as urbanization and population growth advance and demand for “smart cities”
                             rises. our scada (supervisory control and data acquisition) software systems enable
                             detailed tracking of flows of people and goods around the clock, turning “big data” into a
                             valuable tool for the transportation sector. we are also working on a full range of onboard
                             train sensors that send data on component condition and performance to the maintenance
                             engineers for analysis and tracking. integrated solutions like these will help make
                             transportation networks more reliable and cities as a whole greener and more efficient.
                                     the cross-border integration of rail infrastructure is a growing field for our business. to
                             prepare for this, we have actively moved to acquire key players in the european market,
                             such as the railway engineering company (tre) ltd., a provider of training equipment and
                             automatic routing systems. our 2015 acquisition of a significant stake in ansaldo sts, the
                             signaling and train control business of italy’s finmeccanica, will give us greater capacity
                             and improve our position to open new markets and expand our business in europe and the
                             rest of the world.
                                     rail will remain a strong global growth market for the foreseeable future. our goal is to
                             be recognized as the best rail supplier in the world—a company that customers aspire to
                             use to meet their transportation needs. in the past 10 years, we have transformed
                             ourselves from a rail vehicle manufacturer to a total railway solution provider, offering
                             maintenance, financing, signaling, traffic management, and much, much more. we are well
                             on our way to achieving our goal.

initiatives for social infrastructure security

                               increasing dangers are now foreseen from climate change, such as abnormal weather and
                               natural disasters on a global scale. we are also seeing diversification of other threats that
                               can hinder the operation of social infrastructure, such as frequent cyber attacks as urban
                               infrastructure becomes increasingly networked and rises in armed terrorism in response to
                               globalization.
                                       daily life and business in modern society are supported by an assortment of
                               services brought to us by social infrastructure, such as medical care, waterworks,
                               electricity, and transportation. people demand that the provision of services by social
                               infrastructure operators be continuous and stable, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.
                               the networking of infrastructural systems that had previously provided service
                               independently, tying them into other networks and devices to make cities even more
                               convenient, has also been proceeding.
                                       since there is a danger that damage from a disaster or accident could affect a
                               larger area following the initial outbreak, disaster response has become even more
                               important. services provided by social infrastructure depend upon one another, and so
                               the wide variety of relevant organizations and operators must all work together while
                               handling new threats.

                             addressing diverse threats in adaptive, responsive, and cooperative ways

                             in order to strengthen the security of social infrastructure, we must implement appropriate
                             precautionary measures so that services can be maintained even in the event of damage,
                             reducing the expansion of harm and its ripple effects while also being increasingly
                             proactive about growing risks. all concerned institutions need to work together in a
                             coordinated manner as they strive to enact a swift recovery.
                                     we must realize a society robust enough to handle extreme disasters—one where
                             people are protected from threats before they are even realized, without impacting their
                             convenience or comfort. if an accident or attack happens at a large-scale international
                             event, institutions need to work together to respond quickly, protect people’s safety and
                             security while continuing to provide services, and continue handling threats as they surface
                             while safeguarding the convenience of ordinary people.
                                     at hitachi, we believe that social infrastructure security solutions must be adaptive,
                             continually strengthening defenses and precautionary countermeasures for novel and
                             diversifying threats; responsive, seeking to minimize damage and speed up recovery time
                             after a disaster, attack, or other incident has occurred; and cooperative, to address
                             incidents via cooperation and information sharing among different organizations and
                             service providers so that they can be aware of each other’s circumstances. we grapple
                             with a broad range of security countermeasures on both the physical and virtual fronts.
                                     since its founding, hitachi has cultivated a range of individual technologies in the
                             course of providing social infrastructure to the world and worked to integrate them toward
                             further protection of safety and security. we continue to provide comprehensive solutions
                             that cover everything from risk analysis and consulting to system establishment and
                             operational support.


                              case 1: keeping major facilities both convenient and secure against diversified threats

                             in today’s society, where threats of terrorism and violent crime have risen markedly,
                             expectations have also grown for security systems that help to ensure societal safety and
                             security. threats to large-scale facilities like event halls, sports facilities, airports, and
                             stations, where people assemble or transit, are more diverse than simple terrorism. they
                             also include flooding due to torrential rain, large-scale blackouts, and transit outages.
                             providing safety and security requires physical security, employing it or other advanced
                             technology, in addition to human security like guards. in environments with high-volume
                             traffic by people over a large area, more advanced security technologies are also needed
                             to avoid hindering the convenience of ordinary users.
                                     in the three fields of “personal authentication,” “explosives detection,” and “suspicious
                             person tracking technology,” hitachi has been developing security technology that
                             promotes safety and convenience. linking this technology with it systems makes it
                             possible to detect explosives inside a person’s luggage, identify that person’s movements
                             within the facility, and keep track of the individual’s location. these hitachi solutions also
                             enable highly convenient security services necessary for safety evaluation by checking
                             which people and items are safe, based on the results of personal authentication and
                             detection of explosives.

                             biometric technology for smooth and accurate personal authentication
                             today attention is focusing on difficult-to-fool biometric authentication technology that can
                             protect against trespassing by suspicious individuals. one form of biometric technology is
                             finger vein authentication. by requiring users to place their fingers in a specified location, this
                             can cause bottlenecks to the flow of people through a space as they stop at checkpoints. to
                             improve this situation, hitachi has developed finger vein authentication technology for
                             smooth and accurate walkthrough-style personal verification. this allows personal
                             authentication of users merely by having them hold up their fingers while walking past the
                             equipment. by instantaneously detecting a vein pattern on a finger, this technology eases
                             congestion by allowing people to pass through gates more quickly, even when they hold up
                             varying numbers of fingers or present their hands in different positions or orientations.
                                     large facilities are often equipped with multiple units operated through touchscreens,
                             such as atms, ticket vending machines, or check-in stations. hitachi is now developing
                             technology that can enable personal authentication while a user is operating the unit, by
                             taking both a camera image of the user’s face and an infrared image of the finger vein pattern.
                             this technology could allow for highly accurate control of persons within the space.

                             efficient, fast explosive detection technology
                             hitachi has developed a device that can rapidly detect substances adhering to an object
                             or person, such as the raw materials for an explosive. this technology uses pipes to
                             collect air samples from multiple points within the facility at the same time, pulls the air
                             samples into a material analysis device, and determines the location of raw materials from
                             the information obtained by comparing different combinations of those spatially dispersed
                             samples, among other steps. this allows the quick, efficient detection of dangerous
                             material without the need to use multiple expensive mass spectrometers.


                             tracking suspicious persons with security camera imagery
                             hitachi has developed tracking technology that can quickly and accurately follow a
                             suspicious figure inside crowded facilities via fragmentary data, such as the color of
                             clothing or luggage, or the subject’s movement history—even if a security camera has not
                             captured the person’s face. the product automatically extracts and stores in a database
                             data on the characteristics of different parts of a person’s face or upper body, as well as
                             information on the route taken. the associated information can be used to track the
                             movement of a person.

                              case 2: “defense in depth” to protect against rising cyber attack threats

                             particularly in newly emerging economies, installation is underway of social infrastructure
                             that forms the basis for economic development. at the same time, demand for renovation
                             of social infrastructure is also growing in developed nations, where such infrastructure is
                             aging fast. in response to these needs and in order to actualize highly reliable systems at a
                             low price, we have seen increasing usage of general-purpose platforms that can be used
                             in multiple social infrastructure control systems. and as infrastructure has grown more
                             convenient, we have increasingly networked it to other devices or systems, thus increasing
                             connectivity to the internet as a whole.
                                     as a result, control systems for social infrastructure have taken the first steps from
                             being a closed environment to becoming an open one, due to the global sharing of
                             technology and their connections to the digital sphere. their risk of suffering cyber attack
                             has increased accordingly. control systems for social infrastructure are expected to
                             continue providing service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and if this infrastructure stops
                             even briefly, the damage could expand and paralyze urban functionality. particularly in the
                             field of cybersecurity, where new viruses and software allowing fraudulent operation of
                             systems are constantly being developed, it is increasingly difficult to head off all potential
                             problems during the development stage. in the event of an attack, the key is to issue a
                             warning quickly and respond instantaneously in order to minimize the damage.


                             “defense in depth” to minimize damage to control systems
                             hitachi provides products and solutions to implement security measures for the control
                             systems that support social infrastructure, taking into consideration the need for this
                             infrastructure to operate reliably over the long term and the factor of a rising tide of
                             cyber attacks.
                                     hitachi focuses on “defense in depth” when strengthening security for control
                             systems. for example, we enhance security by establishing defense points in several
                             layers of a system. if the outermost firewall is pierced then there is still another security
                             layer after that one, and further layers inside of that. first, an outermost layer guards
                             against intrusions from the network into control systems, or leaks. for particularly critical
                             systems, we provide unidirectional connectivity devices that block off access from the
                             external network. we provide units for monitoring and rejecting untrustworthy pcs to
                             quickly detect an attacker or virus that has penetrated the system and to prevent access
                             to important data or functionality. we are also developing solutions that use special decoy
                             servers to recognize malware that has penetrated at an early stage, capture it, and analyze
                             it. hitachi solutions promote stronger security functionality overall alongside the hardening
                             of each component of the control system.

                             the increasingly networked nature of social infrastructure means that a threat to one type of infrastructure is a threat
                             to the entire network. all infrastructure areas must equip themselves against attacks from the information zone.
                             hitachi develops solutions to swiftly detect unauthorized access and prevent intruders from reaching valuable data
                             and functions. by hardening each component of a control system, we enhance its security capabilities as a whole.




                             contributing to the establishment of international standards
                             as needs for social infrastructure rise around the world, that infrastructure is increasingly
                             being networked. if the security of improperly configured social infrastructure is
                             compromised, the effect can be propagated around the world. in order to boost the
                             security in control systems on a global level, it is an urgent task to establish security
                             guidelines and countermeasures that can be shared and evaluated globally. various
                             governmental bodies, standards organizations, and industry associations are now working
                             to establish standards for the security of control systems. hitachi is establishing guidelines
                             for securely constructing control systems based on the specifications in established
                             standards while also participating proactively in pilot projects to enable operators to obtain

                             activities directed at the development of security technology infrastructure.
                                     furthermore, hitachi has participated since the beginning in an industry-government-
                             academic joint control system security center (cssc) that was established to safeguard
                             the security of critical infrastructure control systems. the cssc performs a comprehensive
                             range of activities, from r&d, international standardization activities, certification,
                             personnel development, and public awareness promotion to the validation of security for all
                             manner of systems. hitachi is collaborating with the organization to promote the
                             improvement of control systems’ security, through activities including joint research into
                             measures to enhance control system security, the use of simulated plants for control
                             system training, and the security auditing of control equipment.

                              case 3: data integration to boost coordination in disaster response

                             as the world faces increasingly serious risks from climate change, threats like natural
                             disasters and abnormal weather are climbing. urban functionality is increasingly advanced
                             and complex today, and the damage resulting from a natural disaster can be higher than
                             ever as a result. in an emergency, when circumstances are shifting from one moment to
                             the next, minimizing the damage done to social infrastructure and enabling the rapid
                             restoration to ordinary life, while placing top priority on the saving of lives, requires all
                             involved organizations to cooperate and make decisions in a swift and sound manner.
                                     to that end, we must first strengthen monitoring functionality across all of society and
                             rapidly collate the needed data. it is also vitally important to organize, categorize, and
                             synthesize the collected data, so that it can be shared across the relevant organizations in
                             order to rapidly analyze the situation and predict how it will unfold.
                                     hitachi develops disaster-prevention and -response solutions that incorporate the
                             “ooda loop” (observe, orient, decide, act)* 1 decision-making concept as an
                             operational paradigm.

                             *1 this sequence of steps was originally devised in the 1970s by the us air force as a model for real-time
                                decision making.


                             rapid decision making with the ooda loop
                             the ooda loop is a theory that enables swift and sound decision making, while repeating
                             the cycle of observe, orient, decide, and act. in the “observe” stage, we rapidly collect
                             data from various sensors such as seismographs, water level monitors, observation
                             cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) and detect abnormalities. in the
                             “orient” stage, we synthesize the collected data, conduct risk simulations of potential
                             damage, and provide supplementary data on possible future developments or situations
                             that may develop in order to grasp the ongoing situation. in the “decide” stage, we
                             support an efficient, effective command structure for rescue and restoration, enabling rapid
                             decision making. and in the “act” stage, we provide functionality for managing the logistics
                             of distribution instructions, inventory control, requests for relief supplies, and community
                             services like safety verification and management of evacuation sites, all while supporting
                             rescue and rebuilding operations.


                             interagency cooperation with the integrated disaster management
                             information system
                             the integrated disaster management information system of japan’s cabinet office is a
                             solution for disaster prevention and disaster response that hitachi provides. its main
                             purpose is to promote the sharing and delivery of disaster readiness and response
                             information held by national and local government bodies while quickly evaluating the
                             scope of a disaster that has occurred. its central functionality, utilizing the geographic
                             information system (gis), is the registration and utilization of disaster-prevention data. this
                             allows the collection and sharing of disaster-prevention data among organizations involved
                             in disaster response and provides functionality for the quick evaluation of earthquake
                             damage by running simulations on the scope of damage when an earthquake has
                             occurred. building on the japanese government’s fundamental plan for national
                             resilience, hitachi expects to roll out further improvements in the transmission and sharing
                             of data, not only at the national level but also among local governments, designated public
                             institutions, and citizens. we are also implementing upgrades to improve information
                             handling, based on the results of studies by various governmental working groups.

                                     hitachi is also extending its observation to data passing through social networking
                             services like twitter, blogs, and message boards, in order to improve its grasp of unfolding
                             disaster situations. we are developing systems to quickly assess these situations by
                             creating map-based visualizations from data found on social networks and providing data
                             that will be useful in decision making.
                                     hitachi will continue pursuing research and development that integrates various data
                             collected when a disaster occurs and produces usable outcomes as a contribution to
                             disaster-response activities, thereby helping to realize a safe and secure society. we hope
                             to contribute to disaster mitigation by providing systems that effectively support decision
                             making and on-the-ground activities when disasters happen.


                              future outlook

                             providing total technology solutions covering broad fields, we aim to optimize
                             social infrastructure security around the world.

                             by connecting many different physical components of its society via it, japan has
                             achieved an advanced social infrastructure. today, though, the threats to social
                             infrastructure, including natural disasters and cyberterrorism, have become increasingly
                             diverse and complex. hitachi provides security technology in a wide range of fields, from
                             control systems to disaster prevention. by crafting not just individual systems but total
                             solutions, we hope to contribute to improving the safety and security of social
                             infrastructure as a whole. we are advancing services taking the technology we have
                             developed in many business areas and utilizing them holistically in order to maintain the
                             security of systems as a whole.
                                     the ability to set forth clear directions and management ability that can utilize security
                             technology appropriately are vital in opposing the rapidly expanding threats we face today.
                             standardization aimed at strengthening crisis management has also become indispensable
                             to the global community. hitachi is contributing to standardization activities that promote
                             enhancing and extending security around the world, in accordance with the technical
                             trends of the international standards field.
                                     to help ensure social infrastructure security on a global scale, we must have
                             personnel with mastery of information, control, and many other systems who can
                             determine customers’ most pressing needs and address them appropriately. hitachi will
                             continue to improve its cultivation of global human resources who are equipped with the
                             skill and mental acumen to handle the task of social infrastructure security optimization
                             around the globe.

                             to realize the hitachi group vision, which draws on our corporate credo and founding spirit
                             that form the core of our csr, we have been sharing throughout the group our csr policy,
                             created in 2005, as the basis of our csr activities. looking toward the next mid-term
                             management plan that will start from fiscal 2016, we have shifted the csr policy to a
                             framework based on iso 26000 to further integrate management and csr strategies. from
                             fiscal 2014, we have been further improving communications with our stakeholders to
                             recognize and fulfill our social responsibilities. we will also reinforce the pdca cycle to ensure
                             execution of our activities and to improve the quality of our management.

                             we use a materiality process based on dialogue with stakeholders to identify material
                             issues. to integrate our management strategies and csr, we reflect in our activities the
                             material issues related to the key management policies in our mid-term management plan
                             and seek to materialize csr in line with our management strategy. moreover, we are
                             currently engaged in group-wide discussion on identifying new material issues in line with
                             global trends.

                             selection process for material issues
                             to select material issues, we evaluate and verify sustainability issues—which are
                             identified through dialogue with stakeholders, such as international organizations,
                             investors, and ngos, as well as by monitoring public policy trends—from two
                             dimensions: importance for stakeholders and influence on business. importance for
                             stakeholders includes human rights, international development, the environment,
                             reporting, ethics, and regional and international demands. influences on business are
                             assessed from the global, fusion-related, and environmental perspectives, the main
                             points of our 2012 mid-term management plan, as well as the perspectives of
                             innovation, risk, reputation, and cost effectiveness.


                                 material issues and reporting
                               the treatment and wording of the six material issues are adjusted flexibly in our
                               sustainability reports in accordance with stakeholder demands and revisions to
                               international guidelines, including those issued by the global reporting initiative (gri).
                                       given the focus of the gri g4 guidelines on stakeholder engagement, we report
                               on public policy initiatives within this framework under the heading “working with
                               governments and public policymakers.” meanwhile, in light of global trends, we report
                               on diversity management in the section titled “diversity and inclusion” to clarify

hitachi r&d and intellectual property

                              it is hitachi’s aim to contribute to the creation of a prosperous society by
                              driving innovation utilizing its advanced technologies. to realize this,
                              three organizations were established to fulfill the missions of
                              collaborative creation with customers, technology innovation, and
                              exploratory research. hitachi will contribute to resolving increasingly
                              global, complex societal issues through the social innovation business.

                              at hitachi, r&d is being accelerated as part of a strategy to achieve growth in the global
                              market, spearheaded by the social innovation business. in april 2015, the central
                              research laboratory, hitachi research laboratory, yokohama research laboratory,
                              design division, and the overseas research centers were realigned along research strategy
                              axes resulting in the establishment of four global centers for social innovation, nine
                              centers for technology innovation, and the center for exploratory research.
                                   “contributing to society through the development of superior, original technology and
                              products” has been hitachi’s corporate credo since its foundation, and under this credo,
                              hitachi has been pursuing world-leading r&d. the realigned research organization will
                              continue to adhere to this credo and, at the same time, firmly establish a customer-driven
                              research framework to co-create solutions to resolve issues, by promoting the following:
                              (1) position researchers close to customers to enhance co-creation
                              (2) create innovative technology meeting customer needs
                              (3) address future societal issues together with national governments and regional communities
                                   new growth will be led by r&d that goes beyond generating technology to also
                              drive innovation.

                              the global centers for social innovation (csi) were formed by integrating the design division,
                              part of the yokohama research laboratory, and overseas research centers. they serve as the
                              frontline organization with researchers positioned in four regions—the asia-pacific, north

                                    open innovation

                                   in order to promote innovative technology development that cannot be achieved by one
                                   company alone, hitachi collaborates with research institutes, universities, and customers
                                   both in and outside of japan to maintain an open r&d environment.
                                           to date, hitachi has pursued basic research in physics to lead innovation for future
                                   computing, devices, and materials through the hitachi cambridge laboratory, established in
                                   1985 within cambridge university in the united kingdom, and metallurgic materials through
                                   the joint research laboratory established with shanghai jiao tong university in fiscal 2012. in
                                   fiscal 2014, hitachi collaborated with 85 research institutes outside japan and 246 research
                                   institutes in japan. hitachi has also been strengthening ties with researchers overseas
                                   through programs such as the hitachi research visit programs (hivips), established in fiscal
                                   1985, to invite researchers to work in the labs in japan under fixed-term employment.
                                           from fiscal 2015, the new center for exploratory research will serve as the hub for open
                                   innovation to generate seeds for hitachi’s next social innovation business. basic research will
                                   be further enhanced through contributions from open innovation to resolve societal issues.


                                    r&d ethics reviews

                                   hitachi has established an ethical review committee based on the “ethical guidelines for
                                   human genome/gene analysis research” from the ministry of education, culture, sports,
                                   science, and technology and the “ethical guidelines for clinical research” from the ministry
                                   of health, labor, and welfare. this committee reviews new projects before the research
                                   starts.
                                           the hitachi ethical review committee*1 was established in september 2000, soon after
                                   we began to handle human genetic analysis information. it was the first ethical review
                                   committee to be established by a private company in japan. today this committee, which
                                   has a majority of external experts, carries out reviews prior to human genetic analysis,
                                   activities associated with genetic analysis, and clinical research.
                                           all hitachi business divisions and group companies that conduct activities falling under
                                   the supervision of the committee are expected to show a high level of corporate social
                                   responsibility and their researchers and staff to hold high ethical standards.

                                   *1 on october 1, 2015, hitachi will shift its focus of interpretation, approaching these as “ethical guidelines for
                                      medical and health research involving human subjects.”

                                     we respect the intellectual property rights (iprs) of others, as we expect them to respect
                                     ours. we follow the hitachi group codes of conduct and conduct preliminary searches of
                                     others’ patents when undertaking r&d on new products and technologies in order to avoid

                                     protecting the hitachi brand is crucial for supporting our global operations. we operate a

                                     of our approach.
                                             we are also educating consumers about these counterfeit goods. in 2014 we
                                     participated in an event held by customs authorities of the united arab emirates and the

                                     officials and garnering their cooperation has become critical for effectively combating

                              reward system for employee inventions

                             we motivate employees in the r&d field with an ample reward system for new inventions. to
                             make this reward system as fair and transparent as possible, we set standards to evaluate
                             inventions and disclose these standards to employees. we also have a mechanism for
                             receiving inquiries about the rewards, as well as opinions on the reward system.
                                     we have set up a special division within the intellectual property division to plan and
                             operate this system. an internal invention management committee made up of r&d, legal
                             affairs, personnel management, and ip experts ensures that the system operates
                             effectively across the whole group. the system includes an invention information channel
                             to promote communication between inventors and the business divisions implementing the
                             resulting patents. inventors can ask the business divisions for information about patent
                             implementation and check the evaluation standards used to calculate the rewards for their
                             inventions. to ensure transparency and inventor satisfaction, we also set up an arbitration
                             committee for invention rewards with the same composition as the invention
                             management committee. inventors can appeal to this committee if they disagree with the
                             amount they have been awarded.
                                     from fiscal 2005, we have also given president’s awards to the top 100
                             inventors. since fiscal 2006, we have also awarded the top 50 young inventors (under
                             35 years old) based on patent application rewards received within five years of their
                             joining hitachi.

                             global campaign rollout
                             it is critical for hitachi to gain stakeholders’ understanding of its social innovation
                             business and corporate vision, which aspire to realize a sustainable society. continuing
                             from fiscal 2013, we conducted the global brand campaign in 18 countries. the
                             campaign uses the slogan “social innovation—it’s our future,” presenting
                             examples of how hitachi’s social innovation business is helping to address the many
                             issues societies now face globally, such as energy issues, depletion of water resources,
                             transportation issues linked to urbanization, healthcare issues associated with the
                             graying of society, advancement of big data and other information technologies, food
                             safety, and information security.
                                     to globally enhance the hitachi brand, we held the hitachi social innovation forum in
                             locations worldwide, including india, brazil, singapore, germany, turkey, and japan,
                             showcasing examples of the social innovation business being conducted in each region.
                             through speeches, panel discussions, and panel exhibits, we presented a wide range of
                             stakeholders—including customers and government officials—with solutions to social
                             issues that countries and regions around the world face today.


                              engagement with employees

                             spreading awareness of the vision to employees group-wide
                             to help solve social issues by promoting understanding of and acting on the hitachi
                             group identity and to realize the hitachi group vision, our brand management must
                             engage everyone in the group. we use channels including our intranet to ensure that
                             group employees are clearly aware of what needs to be done to realize the group
                             vision. to promote understanding of the hitachi brand, we launched the inspiration of
                             the year awards in fiscal 2003 to share within hitachi those activities that have made an
                             outstanding contribution to our brand value. in fiscal 2012, we began evaluating
                             applications globally, renaming the program the inspiration of the year global awards. in
                             fiscal 2014, the awards saw 255 applications from china, europe/africa, india, north
                             america, southeast asia, and japan. outstanding activities from each region were
                             highlighted on the intranet, and the president and coo gave out the awards at a
                             ceremony held at our tokyo headquarters.
                                     to further instill the hitachi group vision in our employees, we shared a behind-the-
                             scenes video on the making of the hitachi vision movie, a visual depiction of the hitachi
                             group vision. we also updated the hitachi vision book, a straightforward explanation
                             using illustrations and photographs, and offered e-learning units setting forth the factors
                             that went into the hitachi group identity and hitachi group vision and how they relate to
                             the mid-term management plan. by raising employee awareness of the hitachi group
                             vision through these activities, we will continue to strive to become a company that
                             “delivers innovations that answer society’s challenges.”

                             accelerating management-employee communication
                             since fiscal 2012, we have been organizing town hall meetings bringing together senior
                             management and employees. we held around 80 town hall meetings at operations in
                             and outside japan during the first two years, and in fiscal 2014, the chairman and ceo
                             and the president and coo attended 45 meetings in the united states, china, and the
                             philippines, as well as in japan and elsewhere.
                                     ordinary business meetings and conferences are limited in agenda, and our
                             communications to employees via our intranet and other channels tend to be one-way.
                             town hall meetings, meanwhile, are intended as forums for direct dialogue where
                             employees can gain a real sense of senior management’s way of thinking and what is
                             needed for hitachi to make the next leap forward, as well as occasions for reaching a
                             shared understanding of the work in which they are involved.
                                     in the town hall meetings, we believe that it is important for senior management to
                             hear the thoughts of front-line employees and for both sides to share their awareness as
                             they engage in dialogue on diverse topics, such as how we can grow our business.


                              working with governments and public policymakers

                             external relations initiatives
                             the social infrastructure field draws particularly strong interest from the public sector. in
                             the task of globally expanding our social innovation business, the government
                             institutions that are the main agents for social infrastructure represent important
                             partners to hitachi, both as customers and as backers. the japanese government has
                             implemented a support structure for infrastructure systems that are being exported with
                             the goal of strengthening japan’s industrial competitiveness. our access to these
                             systems and to government advice is enormously helpful.
                                     in our relations with government institutions outside japan, we gather policy
                             information from a range of sources, frequently engaging with government officials. this
                             dialogue ensures that we have a solid grasp of local social issues and business needs,
                             allowing us to help build better societies. for hitachi, relationships with government
                             institutions in and outside japan are becoming increasingly important.


                             promoting external relations
                             the government & external relations division was established within our headquarters
                             in fiscal 2009 to guide and accelerate the external relations of the entire hitachi group.
                             this was in response to our 2015 mid-term management plan, which focuses on the
                             global expansion of our social innovation business, as well as the growing support
                             offered by the japanese government for infrastructure system exports. through this
                             division, we are working to strengthen government officials’ dialogue with hitachi senior
                             management and with the external relations staff in our business divisions and group
                             companies. we intend to provide government institutions with a better understanding of
                             our business and to offer policy recommendations on key comprehensive policy issues
                             with the prospect of stimulating the industry as a whole.
                                     outside japan, we have offices in washington dc and brussels to monitor policy
                             trends and to manage external relations initiatives in the united states and europe.
                                     to promote external relations group-wide, we hold an annual group meeting to share
                             cases and issues, with an eye to boosting the efficiency of our activities.

                             infrastructure strategy council under the auspices of the cabinet secretariat, and has
                             made specific proposals for boosting japan’s infrastructure exports.
                                     chairman emeritus takashi kawamura is a member of the ministry of economy, trade,
                             and industry’s study group for the creation of japan’s earning power, and other
                             experienced hitachi representatives also take part in various meetings and exchange views
                             regarding policy, making specific recommendations.


                             government support
                             meti provides a global internship program to support global human resource
                             development. this promotes important network and cooperative relationships in
                             business development in the host countries as a part of the ministry’s support for
                             infrastructure system exports. during fiscal 2012, 2013, and 2014, 20 young hitachi
                             group employees took part in this program, which sends junior-level employees from
                             private companies to government institutions and local companies in emerging
                             countries for several months. participation in this type of program allows hitachi to
                             more accurately identify the needs of emerging countries and propose the optimal
                             solutions for their particular social concerns, helping to resolve them.


                             participating in business and industry associations
                             membership in business and industry associations is another critical aspect of our external
                             relations. hitachi is a member of keidanren (japan business federation), where chairman
                             and ceo hiroaki nakanishi has served as vice chair since june 2014, making proposals on
                             cybersecurity measures, as well as chairing the committee on south asia, the committee
                             on information and telecommunication policy, and the committee on education and human
                             resources development (as of june 2015). other executives and employees have roles in
                             numerous other keidanren committees. as the planning and coordination chair for the
                             subcommittee on europe, we also urged the japanese and european governments to
                             pursue early agreement during ongoing negotiations on the japan-eu economic
                             partnership agreement.
                                     as a member of the japan electronics and information technology industries
                             association (jeita), we are participating in the development of an industry response to the
                             general data protection regulation on personal data protection currently under
                             consideration in the european union, as well as the amendments to the act on the
                             protection of personal information being considered in japan.

                                     within the japan electrical manufacturers’ association (jema), hitachi is surveying the
                             status of the development of the social infrastructure in emerging countries, including
                             power generation and transmission facilities, to promote infrastructure system exports. we
                             are also participating in public relations activities—primarily interactions with business
                             operators in these emerging countries—on how japanese technologies and products can
                             help to solve social issues there.


                             international conference participation
                             we participate in international conferences to deepen understanding of our business in
                             other countries. for example, in september 2014 we took part in the india-japan
                             business leaders forum, held when prime minister narendra modi was visiting japan,
                             conducting exchanges of views aimed at economic development in both countries. in
                             november 2014, we participated in a meeting of the japan-us business council,
                             contributing to discussions concerning the trans-pacific partnership and energy policy,
                             and in january 2015 we took part in the world economic forum in davos, switzerland.
                             additionally, we are participating in the tomodachi initiative, a joint japan-us cultural
                             and educational exchange program organized by the us embassy in japan and the
                             us-japan council.


                             united states: hitachi corporate office in washington dc
                             the hitachi corporate office in washington dc examines the impact of us government
                             legislation on our business activities. to promote mutual understanding and improve
                             business opportunities, we communicate to key stakeholders on how hitachi can
                             contribute to the growth of us society.
                                     for example, we share information gathered by the washington office with group
                             companies, exchanging reports on key laws and regulations that impact management and
                             business, analyzing their business impact, and responding appropriately. to increase the
                             effectiveness of these activities, we cooperate with influential external business
                             associations, think tanks, and academic groups, exchanging opinions with specialists and
                             researchers and working through them to make policy proposals.
                                     as part of the global expansion of our social innovation business, we provide
                             information to policymakers and government representatives on hitachi’s technological
                             expertise to convey, both directly and indirectly, how hitachi technologies can
                             contribute to the united states.
                                     since 2009, we have been a joint organizer for the annual eco-engineering forum. in
                             2014, the focus of the gathering, featuring detailed discussion by specialists, was “the
                             new eco-system of information: harnessing the potential of big data.” we also shared the
                             content through pamphlets and a website, distributing this information to relevant bodies.
                             this kind of forum allows us to foster broader understanding of hitachi’s business and
                             technological expertise and to expand our human networks.

                             playing a dynamic role in debate concerning the direction of policy.
                                     since 1998, we have held the eu hitachi science & technology forum to deepen
                             understanding of hitachi’s business. in fiscal 2014, the forum took place in paris,
                             addressing the theme of healthcare. we invited a broad range of stakeholders, including
                             representatives from the french government, corporations, and hospitals, to exchange
                             views on how science and technology can help to solve healthcare issues and improve
                             patients’ quality of life through improved cooperation with stakeholders. at the preparatory
                             stage, we pursued exchanges with such policy makers as the european commission and
                             contributed to the public consultation on the green paper on mobile health (“mhealth”).

environmental management strategies and initiatives


                              hitachi’s approach


                             the world’s population, having passed the 7 billion mark in 2011, is
                             expected to reach 9.5 billion by 2050.*1 at the same time, worldwide gdp
                             continues to grow. this economic growth—led by emerging countries—
                             has led to global warming, caused by a rise in co2 emissions from
                             growing fossil fuel use. the depletion of energy, water, mineral reserves,
                             and other resources due to increased demand, as well as ecosystem
                             destruction and other environmental problems, are also worsening.
                                  hitachi believes that to solve these environmental problems and to
                             realize a sustainable society where humankind can thrive, we must do
                             everything possible to reduce the burden of human activities on the
                             environment. with the environment as an important management focus,
                             therefore, we are working to reduce the environmental burden of our
                             business operations, as well as to raise awareness of environmental
                             issues among all hitachi group employees.
                                  guided by the environmental vision, whose aim is the achievement of
                             a sustainable society, hitachi’s environmental management seeks to
                             attain the goals of the long-term plan environmental vision 2025 and the
                             environmental action plan.

                             *1 according to the united nations report, world population prospects: the 2012 revision.




                               our actions in fiscal 2014
                               in fiscal 2014, the second year of the environmental action plan for 2013 to 2015,
                               we were able to match or exceed annual targets in all areas, including contributing
                               to the reduction of co 2 emissions through products and services, expanding our
                               lineup of hitachi eco-products, and reducing energy use per unit.


                                 the percentage of hitachi eco-product sales rose to 93%, compared to the fiscal
                                 2014 target of 88%.
                                 we contributed to the reduction of an estimated 32.19 million tonnes of

                              environmental management


            core policy         the hitachi environmental vision

                               at hitachi, we aim to achieve the environmental management described in our environmental
                               vision—which in turn aspires to help create a sustainable society—by employing our
                               company’s resources to reduce the burden of human activities on the environment.
                                       we are committed to global warming prevention, resource conservation, and
                               ecosystems preservation as the three pillars of our vision. our goal is to achieve a more
                               sustainable society by promoting global production that reduces the environmental burden
                               of a product throughout its life cycle.

                               hitachi’s environmental vision




                               our long-term plan: environmental vision 2025
                               the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) concluded in the synthesis report of
                               its fifth assessment report, issued in november 2014, that climate warming is unequivocal
                               and extremely likely to be caused by human activities. this announcement, which reinforced
                               arguments that have been made for some time, confirms once again that reducing co2 and
                               other greenhouse gases is essential for the prevention of global warming.
                                       accordingly, the hitachi group environmental vision 2025 is a long-term plan that
                               targets the prevention of global warming, one of the major issues that the world is facing
                               today. the vision states our goal of helping to reduce annual co2 emissions by 100 million
                               tonnes by 2025 through improved hitachi products and services. our aim is to do our part
                               toward achieving a major reduction in co2 emissions by providing our customers with
                               products that supply low-carbon energy, as well as energy-efficient products. to reach
                               these goals, we are working to increase the ratio of hitachi eco-products, which have a
                               reduced burden on the environment, in our product range. we are expanding business
                               opportunities further by working with partners in global markets.


                               instituting the hitachi action guidelines for environmental conservation
                               the action guidelines for environmental conservation were drawn up to show the
                               direction of our business management initiatives for environmental protection as we set out
                               to realize the hitachi environmental vision.

                                 hitachi action guidelines for environmental conservation
                                 1    global environmental conservation is a critical challenge shared by all humans. hitachi is
                                      committed, therefore, to fulfilling its responsibilities by assisting in the realization of an
                                      environmentally harmonious and sustainable society as one of its management priorities.
                                 2    hitachi will make efforts to contribute to society by developing highly reliable technologies
                                      and production processes, while identifying needs considering concerns related to the
                                      prevention of global warming, conservation of resources, and preservation of ecosystems.
                                 3    members of the board of directors in charge of environmental conservation are responsible
                                      for facilitating appropriate environmental conservation activities. departments responsible
                                      for environmental conservation should endeavor to promote and ensure environmental
                                      conservation activities, including improving environment-related rules and regulations and
                                      setting goals for environmental burden reduction. these departments should also confirm
                                      that their environmental conservation activities are conducted in a proper manner and
                                      ensure that these activities are maintained and improved.
                                 4    hitachi will promote globally applicable “monozukuri” with the aim of understanding and
                                      reducing environmental burdens at every stage, including product research and
                                      development, design, production, distribution, sales, usage, and final disposal.
                                 5    hitachi will investigate and review the environmental impact caused in the course of its
                                      “monozukuri” processes. hitachi will also introduce excellent technologies and materials
                                      useful to safeguard the environment, in other words, to reduce environmental burdens
                                      through energy and resource saving, recycling, chemical substance management,
                                      consideration for the ecosystem, and other measures.
                                 6    hitachi’s environmental conservation efforts are not only to be focused on observing
                                      international environmental regulations and those of national and local governments, but
                                      also on conserving the environment by implementing voluntary environmental standards
                                      when necessary.
                                 7    regarding globally applicable “monozukuri” activities, impact on the local environment and
                                      community are to be considered. in addition, measures that meet local communities’
                                      requests should be implemented.
                                 8    hitachi will educate its employees to take action in order to obey environment-related laws,
                                      raise their global environmental awareness, and encourage their interest in environmental
                                      conservation having a broad overview of society’s activities.
                                 9    hitachi will evaluate potential environmental problems and prevent them from occurring. in
                                      the event that any environmental problem occurs, hitachi will take appropriate measures
                                      to minimize the environmental burden.
                                10    hitachi will make efforts to disclose information on its environmental conservation activities
                                      to its relevant stakeholders. hitachi will also actively communicate with these
                                      stakeholders so as to strengthen mutual understanding and forge cooperative
                                      relationships with them.




            core policy        promoting the environmental action plan

                              our environmental action plan was created and designed to carry out the measures in our
                              action guidelines for environmental conservation. this plan sets improvement targets for
                              specific areas, and environmental initiatives are promoted by executing and improving activities
                              in every area. to give our environmental strategy a more prominent role in our management
                              strategy, we are promoting the environmental action plan as a three-year plan, aligning it with
                              the mid-term management plan for the hitachi group covering fiscal 2013 to 2015.
                                      we have also begun drafting the 2018 environmental action plan for fiscal 2016 to
                              2018, to be implemented concurrently with the next mid-term management plan to be
                              decided in fiscal 2016.

                             building environmental management systems
                             we have established environmental management criteria to ensure efficient management
                             of each business site’s environmental load. there are approximately 250 business sites
                             that meet these criteria. the r&d group, 5 in-house companies, and 11 group companies
                             together with the csr and environmental strategy division have developed and
                             implemented the hitachi group environmental promotion organization ems (environmental
                             management system) to promote the consistent implementation of environmental policies.
                             at the same time, every business site meeting the criteria for environmental management
                             continues to maintain iso 14001 certification. certification is also being pursued at
                             business sites that do not yet meet the criteria.

                             monitoring environmental performance data
                             for effective environmental management, we collect data on the environmental
                             performance of business operations using the environmental load evaluation system.
                                     this system collects environmental load data from some 250 hitachi business sites
                             worldwide on items such as energy use, co2 emissions, and waste generation, together
                             with information on awards received and other items. by analyzing this information we
                             identify environmental management issues, share instructive examples within the group,
                             and improve environmental practices. specifically, we collect and analyze environmental
                             performance data in the key areas of energy, waste materials, water, and vocs monthly
                             and quarterly so that performance levels can be further increased.

                             environmental activities. it divides environmental activities into eight categories and
                             evaluates achievements and progress toward action plan targets by rating 52 items on a
                             scale from 1 to 5. a perfect score for any category is 100 green points (gps). we
                             surpassed our fiscal 2014 target of 576 gps with a score of 602 gps. as we further raise
                             the level of environmental activities, we are targeting 640 gps for fiscal 2015.

                                          climate change: risks and opportunities


                   core policy                 engaging with the risks and opportunities of climate change

                                              the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc)
                                              states that “warming of the climate system is unequivocal,” noting evidence of “warming of
                                              the atmosphere and oceans” and “increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases.”
                                              looking ahead, the report warns that our ability to adapt may be hindered and urges major
                                              innovations in political, social, economic, and technological systems so that effective
                                              adaptation measures can be implemented. along with mitigation measures, these steps
                                              will help us move toward achieving a resilient society and sustainable development.
                                                      hitachi recognizes the risks of climate change as a vital management issue. seeing
                                              opportunities in the mitigation of and adaptation to these risks—the former by reducing
                                              greenhouse gases and the latter by changing how society interacts with nature—we are
                                              working closely with our customers and partners to promote our social innovation
                                              business, which fuses social infrastructure with information technology to tackle the many
                                              challenges facing society.

                             regulatory risks and opportunities
                             the environmental regulations and policies of countries and regions around the world
                             include measures that affect business activities at manufacturing sites, such as emissions
                             trading, carbon taxes, and energy efficiency standards, and those that affect product and
                             service conditions, such as energy efficiency standards for products, carbon footprint
                             labeling, and the introduction of a feed-in tariff system for renewable energy. we view
                             these regulations and policies as potential business risks. at the same time, efforts in
                             individual countries and regions to reduce co2 emissions are helping to expand our
                             business in the areas of energy-saving equipment and high-efficiency equipment and
                             devices. energy conservation initiatives are growing to encompass entire cities, as
                             exemplified by smart cities. we will work to further expand our business by providing
                             environmentally conscious solutions suited to the needs of each country or region.


                             risks and opportunities presented by physical factors
                             global warming is leading to extreme weather conditions, such as more powerful typhoons
                             and heavier rainfall, causing natural disasters worldwide. hitachi has had its share of
                             damage, including flooding of southeast asian business sites and submersion of areas
                             surrounding business sites in japan due to river embankments giving way. in china, we
                             face challenges in the areas of water quality and procurement of the water needed for
                             manufacturing. these issues present risks that could reduce production capacity and raise
                             operational costs, as well as threaten the continuity of our business operations.
                                     meanwhile, in response to growing worldwide demand for measures against natural
                             disasters, business is expanding for disaster-prevention information systems and other
                             disaster-related products and services. this produces new business opportunities for
                             companies that contribute to the development of a sustainable society that can cope with
                             climate change by using the latest it to collate and analyze big data. this data includes
                             the information kept on our daily lives, information continually recorded by the social
                             infrastructure systems that support our lives, and information on factors like weather and
                             climate, as well as supplementary data that is updated every day.


                             other risks and opportunities
                             if our initiatives to tackle global warming are insufficient, conceivable risks include a
                             loss of reputation and market rejection of products and services that are not
                             environmentally conscious.
                                     measures against droughts related to climate change are now an urgent issue, and
                             interest is growing toward hitachi’s water environment solutions business in regions
                             where water shortages are becoming apparent. water environment solutions are a key
                             part of our social innovation business. we help to preserve and improve the global water
                             environment through such initiatives as seawater desalination, the development of water
                             infrastructure including water treatment systems, and the greening of deserts by
                             constructing pump stations.

environmentally conscious products and services


                                  hitachi’s approach

                                 demand for products and services is increasing against the backdrop of
                                 megatrends like population growth and advancing urbanization
                                 accompanying economic development. at the same time, global warming,
                                 resource depletion, ecosystem destruction, and other environmental
                                 problems are worsening.
                                     hitachi believes that reflecting environmental consciousness in its
                                 products and services is vital to building a sustainable society. to
                                 reduce the environmental burden of products and services throughout
                                 their life cycle, therefore, we are developing and expanding the ratio of
                                 products called eco-products, which meet standards for environmental
                                 consciousness, recycling product resources, and managing chemical
                                 substances.
                                     in particular, we have set three key performance indicators (kpis) to
                                 guide our efforts: eco-product sales ratio, number of eco-products
                                 select, and contributions of the products to co2 emission reductions.



                                   our actions in fiscal 2014
                                   during fiscal 2014, we continued our efforts to reduce the environmental burden of
                                   products and services throughout their life cycle. also, in regard to design and
                                   development outside japan, we are moving forward with a planned approach to
                                   expanding the lineup of eco-products.


                                     our eco-product sales ratio reached 93%.
                                     the number of eco-products select models increased by 133 from fiscal 2013,
                                     bringing the total to 343 products.
                                     the annual contribution to co2 reduction through products was an estimated 32.19
                                     million tonnes, exceeding the target of 28 million tonnes.
                                     we collected around 68,000 tonnes of end-of-life home appliances, of which we
                                     recycled approximately 60,000 tonnes. we also collected some 13,000 tonnes of
                                     end-of-life it and industrial products, recycling about 12,000 tonnes of this.




                               promoting eco-products


 policies and frameworks          increasing the ratio of eco-products

                                 we develop environmentally conscious products called eco-products as part of our initiative
                                 to reduce the environmental burden of our products and services as much as possible.
                                         eco-products must meet criteria used in the design and development stages, when
                                 we evaluate the extent to which their environmental burden can be reduced. to promote
                                 their development, we have set targets for raising the eco-product sales ratio, a figure
                                 measuring eco-product sales against total product sales.
                                         eco-products that meet even more demanding requirements are designated as eco-
                                 products select. we are also working to produce more of these products.

                             the hitachi group evaluates the environmental consciousness of products and services at
                             the design and development stage, using the assessment for dfe (design for
                             environment), and designates ones that meet the criteria as eco-products.
                                     in the assessment for dfe, the environmental load throughout the product life cycle—
                             from material procurement to production, distribution, use, collection and disassembly, and
                             appropriate disposal or recycle—is assessed using eight dfe criteria, including
                             environmental protection measures and energy savings. the results are graded on a scale
                             of 1 to 5. for a product to be designated an eco-product, it must score at least level 2,
                             the reference level before the latest major model change, in all eight assessment criteria,
                             and its average over all the criteria must be level 3 or higher.

                                        emission reduction rate at least 50% greater than fiscal 2005 products. “factor 10 or
                                        more” indicates that the product has a global warming prevention efficiency or resource

                                        the global warming prevention factor indicates the amount of improvement in efficiency of
                                        global warming prevention compared with a reference product. the efficiency of global
                                        warming prevention is based on a concept of environmental efficiency balancing the value
                                        of products contributing to the quality of life and the reduction of their environmental load.
                                        we measure the improvement in quality of life by product function and life span and use
                                        the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over the product life cycle to calculate the

             key approaches                eco-products under hitachi’s sustainability practice scheme

                                          in cooperation with the national capital region office of the national park service, hitachi
                                          consulting corporation in the united states has been helping national parks in the
                                          national capital region obtain climate friendly park* 1 certification by reducing greenhouse
                                          gas (ghg) emissions. this project is classified as one of hitachi consulting’s eco-products
                                          under the sustainability practice scheme. the company has been creating ghg inventories

                                          educational workshops for park staff and partners, and producing educational materials.
                                          as a result, all 13 national parks in the national capital region have achieved climate
                                          friendly parks status as of fiscal 2014. all parks have adopted climate action plans
                                          including ghg reduction goals for transportation, energy, and waste emissions. through
                                          these efforts, the national capital region office forecasts that direct emissions such as
                                          those from fossil fuels will be reduced by 12%, energy-related indirect emissions from
                                          electricity usage by 7%, and other indirect emissions from waste and other sources in the
                                          value chain by 15%.

            key approaches               hitachi products helping to reduce co2 emissions

                                        in fiscal 2014, we expect to achieve a reduction in co2 emissions through products of
                                        32.19 million tonnes, better than the target of 28 million tonnes. major contributions to this
                                        achievement came from the products and services of our power systems company,
                                        infrastructure systems company, information & telecommunication systems company,
   contribution of hitachi products     hitachi appliances, and hitachi construction machinery. we plan to work even harder to
     and services to the reduction
                    co2 emissions       develop and popularize other products that contribute to co2 emission reductions.


            key approaches               addressing our carbon footprint

                                        the carbon footprint of products (cfp) is the co2 equivalent of the total amount of
                                        greenhouse gases (ghgs) emitted over the entire life cycle of a product or service—from
                                        procurement of materials through to disposal and recycling. making the ghg emission
                                        amount visible in this way boosts consumer interest in buying products with low carbon
                                        emissions and encourages businesses to reduce the amount of carbon emitted by their
                                        products over the whole life cycle. a number of countries around the world use the cfp
                                        approach.
                                                we participate in the carbon footprint communication program of the japan
                                        environmental management association for industry (jemai) and are working to expand

                                        approved by the jemai cfp program. in addition to visualizing co 2 emission amounts, we

               core policy                    next steps

                                            we have set the targets for raising the eco-product sales ratio to 90% and the number of
                                            eco-products select models to 340 by fiscal 2015. to meet these goals, we are working
                                            on product and service development plans aimed at expanding the number of eco-
                                            products, as well as working on creating additional value for the products and services by
                                            lowering their environmental burden in ways that will help our business to grow.

               core policy                    recycling product resources

                                            hitachi is reducing the environmental burden of products at the disposal stage through
                                            efforts that include collecting end-of-life products for use as resources, such as by
                                            recycling and refurbishing parts for reuse. by effectively utilizing these products, we play a
                                            role in addressing global environmental issues, including limiting the additional raw
                                            resources that must be extracted from nature, reducing the use of energy and water
                                            resources at extraction sites, and averting the air, water, and soil pollution that
                                            accompanies landfilling, incinerating, and other waste-disposal methods in areas where
                                            end-of-life products are generated.

           key approaches                product collection and recycling

                                        in order to comply with the 2001 home appliance recycling law, hitachi has taken part in
                                        cooperative efforts by five companies*1 in the same industry while recycling air
                                        conditioners, televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines at 18 recycling plants
                                        nationwide. in fiscal 2014, we reused and recycled around 60,000 tonnes of the roughly
                                        68,000 tonnes of end-of-life products we collected.
                                                today we are building on our know-how in recycling home appliances by creating a
                                        recycling network and expanding collection and recycling programs to include it products
                                        like personal computers, servers, and communication equipment; industrial equipment
                                        including pumps, motors, distribution boards, transformers, refrigeration equipment, and
                                        machine tools; and industrial air conditioners and medical equipment. in fiscal 2014, we
                                        reused and recycled around 12,000 tonnes of the roughly 13,000 tonnes of the end-of-life
                                        it products, industrial equipment, and other items we collected.

           key approaches                medical equipment recycling

                                        hitachi medical corporation pursues the effective reuse of metal, plastic, and other
                                        resources by collecting and recycling end-of-life medical equipment, which may also
                                        contain rare metals and other scarce and exhaustible resources. as a manufacturer,
                                        collecting equipment for recycling allows the company to control the need for
                                        additional natural resources to be extracted and to reduce waste.

policies and frameworks          creating eco-factories & offices select

                                since fiscal 2011, we have implemented an eco-factories & offices select certification
                                program for locations that show a high level of environmental consciousness.
                                certification criteria were developed for our manufacturing (factory) and
                                nonmanufacturing (office) divisions globally. to maintain and raise the level of
                                environmental awareness through eco-factories & offices select, certified factories and
                                offices will be re-evaluated every fiscal year to confirm that their performance continues
                                to meet requirements. in fiscal 2014, 14 facilities obtained new certifications and 54
                                facilities had their certifications renewed.

                               efficiently. in fiscal 2014, we achieved a reduction of 16% (from fiscal 2005, the base year),
                               surpassing the target of 13%. to achieve further reductions, we are systematically
                               installing high-efficiency equipment and devices, from led lighting to inverter air
                               conditioners, and increasing the efficiency of our energy usage by improving
                               manufacturing processes. we are also visually displaying energy use data at in-house and
                               group companies as an incentive to make further improvements.

                             telecommunication systems company offices. the ieee 1888 is an international
                             communication standard developed through an open process for controlling building
                             energy management systems. applying this standard lets us seamlessly connect existing
                             machines and sensors with various services, such as for data usage and visualization, and
                             apply them to energy conservation measures throughout entire buildings.
                                     numerous air-conditioning units are in operation at the hitachi omori 2nd building. the
                             introduction of m2m data collection solutions through installation of environmental sensors
                             made it possible to visualize power consumption and environmental impact without
                             replacing the units. this allowed for integrated management of multiple units at low cost
                             and with minimal installation time. furthermore, effective use of the central air-conditioning
                             system and standalone units maintained comfortable room environments while achieving
                             energy savings of up to 14%.
                                     hitachi plans to expand monitoring by machines and equipment beyond its
                             application in office building energy conservation, extending it to a range of uses in

                                 for fiscal 2014, we set a target of a 21% reduction (from the fiscal 2005 base year) for
                                 waste and valuables generated per unit, bettering this by achieving a 25% reduction.
                                 every factory and office is reducing waste through onsite recycling of byproducts and
                                 scrap from the production process and efforts to curb use of raw materials related to
                                 transport. under the zero emission initiative, which seeks to minimize landfill disposal, 123
          zero emission sites    facilities achieved their zero emission goal*1 as of fiscal 2014.

                                 *1 defined as a final disposal rate (landfill disposal/waste and valuables) of less than 0.5% in any given year.

        key approaches            using it for managing waste

                                 hitachi has developed a waste management system aimed at more efficient processes
                                 and reduced compliance risk. this system enables better waste management through
                                 visualization of waste produced at locations from small offices with lower waste volumes
                                 to larger business sites and contract operations. it is also being used as a tool for
                                 keeping track of waste volume and to share methods for more effective use of resources.
                                 from fiscal 2014, it has also been used at business sites outside of japan to closely
                                 manage waste. in japan, we aim to boost the hitachi group e-manifest*1 registration ratio
                                 to at least 90% by fiscal 2015. as of fiscal 2014, 154 sites had introduced e-manifest
                                 systems, raising the registration rate to 89%.

                core policy           water conservation

                                     water-related issues are diverse. they include shortages of domestic-use water due to
                                     population growth and regional conflict, as well as impact on agricultural crops, land
                                     subsidence from overuse of ground water, and ecological destruction from wastewater. as
                                     water conservation is an essential aspect of resolving these issues, we have set targets for
                                     water conservation, such as by limiting water use during business operations. we are
                                     working across the world to achieve these targets.


                    results           actions and achievements

                                     in fiscal 2014, we set a target for our business sites outside japan of a 28% reduction (over
                                     the fiscal 2005 base year) for water use per unit and achieved a 43% reduction. a growing
                                     portion of our production takes place outside japan, and we are promoting efficient use of
                                     water through conservation worldwide.

                                   wastewater from production and reuses it to water plants on factory grounds, wash down
                                   roadways, and flush toilets, among other uses, at all five production bases. wastewater is
                                   also collected and treated for reuse in the production processes. the paint line at the
                                   shanghai factory uses wastewater to degrease; the paint line at the tianjin factory utilizes
a wastewater treatment facility.
                                   wastewater in its water curtain system. as a result of these measures, water use in fiscal
                                   2014 was reduced by around 100,000 m3 at the five production bases.

                                   india, the company in fiscal 2014 updated the layout of piping inside the facility to reduce
                                   water leakage, removed unnecessary pipes, and restricted unidentified draws on water
                                   resources. other efforts were the determination of appropriate amounts of water for watering
a newly installed water pipe.
                                   plants within the factory premises and the installation of automatic sensors in toilets. through
                                   these methods, the company reduced water use by 7%, or 7,500 m3, compared to the
                                   previous year.

                                to prevent air pollution, we have cut emissions from 41 volatile organic compounds (vocs)
                                designated on the basis of a scheme by the japanese ministry of the environment.
                                initiatives in fiscal 2014 to reduce voc emissions included switching from paints containing
                                vocs to water-soluble and powder paints, expanding the use of stainless steel and plated
                                sheet steel chassis, and altering washing processes. we successfully achieved our targets
                                through these initiatives. we also monitor and manage emissions of sulfur oxides (sox) and
                                nitrogen oxides (nox),*1 which are required to be measured under the laws and regulations

           key approaches            use of high-solid coatings to reduce vocs

                                    since fiscal 2006, hitachi construction machinery co., ltd.’s tsuchiura works has been
                                    working to switch to high-solid (low-solvent) coatings for hydraulic excavator
                                    components, enabling voc content to be reduced to 40%–50% of previous levels.
                                    tsuchiura works has gradually expanded the use of these coatings to more components,
                                    including covers, tanks, weights, and frames. in fiscal 2014, voc emissions were

           key approaches                   electrodeposition coating to reduce vocs

                                          in 2014, hitachi elevator (china) co., ltd., switched from electrostatic spray coating to
                                          electrodeposition coating for the first coating of elevator parts including hatches and car
                                          tops. this reduced voc emissions from coatings by 3 tonnes. hitachi elevator also
                                          changed the waste gas treatment method from water curtains to catalytic combustion
                                          and activated carbon adsorption. this improved voc removal efficiency from 36% to
loading an elevator hatch for coating.    90% and reduced vocs in waste gases by 1.7 tonnes.


           key approaches                   managing storage of equipment containing pcbs

                                          we gather and manage information on storing and handling equipment that uses
                                          polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) every year, positioning this as one environmental
                                          management item of the hitachi group. we furthermore promote the efficient and
                                          thorough treatment of these units. waste materials with high pcb concentrations are
                                          subjected to a treatment program based on requirements set by the national government

                                          companies that have been certified and have the capacity to handle them. in fiscal 2014,
                                          waste materials containing pcbs stored at 39 business sites were treated.

                                          atmospheric emissions, we are switching to alternative substances with low voc content
                                          and finding ways to improve the processes. we are aiming for a 40% reduction in voc

                                          management criteria that are more stringent than regulatory requirements. we regularly
                                          monitor water quality, noise levels, and other conditions at each business site and work to
                                          minimize environmental risks. in addition, we take every possible step to prevent problems
                                          or their recurrence and to strengthen controls by sharing information on environmental laws
                                          and regulations, as well as examples of infringements, throughout the group.

preserving ecosystems


                                       hitachi’s approach

                                      as economic development and urbanization continue on a global scale,
                                      biodiversity faces risks from continued environmental degradation,
                                      pollution, and overuse of natural resources.
                                          hitachi believes that preservation of ecosystems is vital for
                                      sustaining biodiversity and ensuring a vibrant environment for coming
                                      generations. this idea forms a pillar of our environmental vision and our
                                      group-wide conservation efforts.

 policies and frameworks        corporate relationship with ecosystems

                               corporations depend on “ecosystem services,” including the natural supply of materials
                               like fibers and wood, and the ability of ecosystems to maintain the quality and quantity of
                               air, water, and soil. contributing to ecosystem preservation through both business and
                               social activities enables companies to continue receiving these benefits and to restore
                               ecosystems. through its business activities, hitachi is promoting designs and production
                               methods that reduce the impact on ecosystems throughout the product life cycle (material
                               procurement, production, distribution, use, collection and disassembly, and appropriate
                               disposal and recycling). we are also increasing the number of products and services for
                               direct preservation of ecosystems, such as water purification and air pollution prevention
                               measures. we view chemical substance management as part of ecosystem preservation
                               and continually ensure that it is carried out correctly. to contribute to society, we
                               encourage employee volunteer programs, such as tree planting and ecological surveys of
                               rare plants and animals, as well as other programs that preserve ecosystems.

        key approaches          encouraging action to preserve ecosystems

                               the hitachi group guide to preservation of ecosystems is a guidebook for outlining the
                               relationship between corporate activities and ecosystems, introducing trends and
                               examples of initiatives being taken around the world, and making recommendations.
                                       to deepen employee understanding, in fiscal 2014 we carried out the business
                               assessment on the preservation of ecosystems at 203 factories and offices (excluding the
                               headquarters of each company) in and outside japan. this is a self-assessment sheet
                               covering the relationship between operations and ecosystems. through these assessments
                               we encourage actions that preserve ecosystems, taking in broad perspectives including
                               design, procurement, manufacturing, transportation, and product use. we also aim to
                               stimulate thinking about the development of new products and services related to
                               ecosystem preservation. with regard to contributions to society through nature
                               conservation, we are developing a deeper appreciation of ecosystem preservation by
                               studying the impact on and benefits to local ecosystems.
                                       we will improve each group company’s initiatives through this assessment program
                               and implementation of action plans from fiscal 2016 onward.

                                       in february 2012, the world business council for sustainable development (wbcsd)
                                       developed and released business ecosystems training (bet) materials. hitachi prepared
                                       japanese-language versions of all modules, as well as instructor manuals, and made them
                                       available on the company website.
                                               in fiscal 2013–14, the biodiversity working group of four japanese electrical and
                                       electronic industry associations developed the educational tool let’s study biodiversity

            key approaches              ecosystem-conscious water management

                                       the japan business initiative for biodiversity (jbib) is an organization that aims to help
                                       preserve ecosystems through joint research conducted by a diverse range of companies.
                                       in pursuit of that goal, the jbib convenes various working groups to engage in
                                       biodiversity-related activities including voluntary research, development of tools, their
                                       application in the workplace, and information sharing.
                                               hitachi has been taking part in the water and ecosystems working group. in 2013, the
                                       group issued its corporate water management guide to conserve biodiversity. this was
                                       followed in 2015 by development of the evaluation tool for corporate water management to
                                       conserve biodiversity. this is a tool for examining and making proposals for water management
                                       across the value chain, the river basin on which a factory depends, and at company sites, as
                                       well as for collaboration with stakeholders, with a particular focus on ecosystems preservation
                                       and risk management. the working group plans to release the evaluation tool to jbib members
                                       and seek their input on it while also carrying out case studies and seeking to make the tool even

environmental communication


                               hitachi’s approach

                              to build a sustainable society, it is vital for a company to provide
                              information to stakeholders on its activities to reduce the burden on and
                              conserve the environment while also gathering feedback from a wide
                              range of stakeholders and seeking to deepen mutual understanding.
                                   hitachi is making a concerted effort to provide such information on
                              environmental activities, at the same time striving to improve those
                              activities by promoting mutual communication. in addition, we aim to
                              raise environmental awareness throughout society with this broad-based
                              communication.



                                our actions in fiscal 2014
                                in fiscal 2014, we employed a variety of methods to diffuse environmental information,
                                including setting up events for direct dialogue with stakeholders. we also promoted
                                environmental communication to deepen our relationships with stakeholders in and
                                outside japan.


                                  hitachi was selected as one of the companies on the 2014 climate performance
                                  leadership index compiled by the cdp,*1 a nonprofit organization.
                                  the hitachi group sustainability report 2014 won the prize for excellence in

                                   disclose, manage, and share key environmental information on companies and cities. on behalf of 767
                                   investors, representing us$92 trillion in assets, the cdp sends a survey on climate change to corporations
                                   and then evaluates the results. in 2013, the organization shortened its name from the carbon disclosure
                                   project to cdp.

                              the hitachi group csr report as the hitachi group sustainability report, in response to
                              the global need for a sustainability report.

                                         in focus

                                          creating value by reducing environmental burden

                                         to better position environmental strategy within the hitachi business strategy, we have
                                         formulated an environmental action plan that corresponds to the mid-term management
                                         plan of the hitachi group. we are making steady progress in our environmental activities
                                         by implementing this action plan while steadily making improvements to it.
                                                 we set the concrete objective for fiscal 2015 of having environmentally conscious
                                         “eco-products” make up 90% of our overall sales. toward that end, we are expanding the
                                         eco-product range in line with the development plans for each product and service, in
                                         addition to striving to enhance the value of our products and services by reducing the
                                         burden they place on the environment. this helps in the end to grow our business as well.
                                                 to reduce the environmental burden of our business activities, we also present
                                         factories and offices that show remarkable consideration for the environment and
                                         outstanding results in this area with our eco-factory & office select certification. hitachi
                                         aims to continue promoting environmentally conscious production through these energy-
                                         efficient suppliers of products and services.
                                                 in fiscal 2015, we will work to further promote environmental efforts by formulating the
                                         next environmental action plan, which will correspond to the mid-term management plan
                                         to be decided in fiscal 2016.

respect for human rights


                               hitachi’s approach

                              as our value chain expands to a global scale, human rights risks have
                              increased worldwide in relation to working environments, business practices
                              in each region, and supplier relations that are different from region to region.
                              moreover, corporations are expected to address human rights issues in
                              accordance with international standards such as the un guiding principles
                              on business and human rights.
                                   in carrying out our business, hitachi recognizes human rights as a key
                              issue related to risk management. on the basis of this awareness, we will
                              respect the human rights of all stakeholders, including our employees and
                              communities in every country and region where we operate, and those
                              throughout supply chains.
                                   toward that end, we are engaged in various initiatives under the hitachi
                              group human rights policy, such as our human rights training for employees
                              and the development of a guidance document on human rights due diligence.


                                our actions in fiscal 2014
                                hitachi has added the perspective of business and human rights to its existing
                                policies related to human rights, developing a guidance document on human rights
                                due diligence that explains procedures to embed human rights into everyday business
                                practices. we are also working to deepen employee awareness of the issues through
                                efforts that include president and coo toshiaki higashihara delivering a topical
                                message on human rights day and the convening of study groups to explore issues
                                related to human rights. additionally, we are working to improve the response to
                                human rights risks in china and other asian countries.

                                  development of a guidance document for implementing human rights due diligence,
                                  in collaboration with the nonprofit organization shift.
                                  holding of study meetings to promote a better understanding of lgbt issues, in
                                  collaboration with the nonprofit organization nijiiro diversity.
                                  meetings with 9 group companies in the philippines, 15 group companies in
                                  indonesia, and 26 group companies in thailand to explain hitachi’s human rights
                                  initiatives and the potential risks in their countries related to human rights.



            core policy        human rights initiatives

                              in may 2013, we adopted the hitachi group human rights policy to supplement the
                              hitachi group codes of conduct, drawn up in fiscal 2010. in this policy, we clarify our
                              understanding of human rights as being, at a minimum, those outlined in the international
                              bill of human rights and the international labour organization’s declaration on
                              fundamental principles and rights at work. this policy shapes hitachi’s approach to
                              meeting the responsibility to respect human rights, including implementing human rights
                              due diligence*1 in line with the un guiding principles on business and human rights,*2
                              providing appropriate education to employees, adhering to national laws and regulations in
                              all the regions and countries where we operate, and seeking ways to honor the principles
                              of international human rights when faced with conflicts between internationally recognized
                              human rights standards and national laws.
                                    in fiscal 2014, hitachi added the perspective of business and human rights to its
          hitachi group
                              existing structures and policies and developed a guidance document on human rights due
       codes of conduct       diligence that explains procedures for everyday business practices. moving forward, we

                              hitachi’s policies and initiatives related to human rights, the message addressed the
                              importance of respecting human rights of all stakeholders related to our business, including
                              those of our employees, business partners, and customers. this message went via e-mail to

            key approaches                 human rights due diligence initiatives

                                          in our hitachi group human rights policy, we pledged to continue to develop structures for
                                          human rights due diligence. toward that end, in fiscal 2013 some business units implemented
                                          pilot programs for human rights due diligence to identify key issues that need to be clarified
                                          for implementation of the due diligence throughout the hitachi group, while also analyzing
                                          and evaluating human rights risks in six of the asean countries. based on the results of
                                          these pilot programs, in fiscal 2014 we developed a guidance document for implementing
                                          human rights due diligence in collaboration with the nonprofit organization shift.


            key approaches                 raising awareness about sexual minorities (lgbt)

                                          as a part of our corporate strategy, we promote diversity and inclusion and pledge to
                                          respect and benefit from individuality, viewing differences in sexual orientation as a
                                          reflection of that individuality. as human capital becomes more diverse, we are striving for
                                          all of our workforce to understand and respect coworkers who are sexual minorities, such

                                          gave a presentation to staff in charge of human capital. furthermore, during human rights
                                          week that same month, study meetings were held for personnel in charge of human capital
                                          at hitachi, ltd.’s business sites, as well as at group companies in japan, in order to
                                          promote correct understanding of lgbt issues. these meetings highlighted the need to
                                          promote a good working environment where lgbt employees do not have to conceal their
      diversity and inclusion             sexual orientation.

                                       pilot program and of hitachi’s human rights initiatives. future plans to deal with such risks
                                       were also outlined. feedback from participants noted that the explanations covered a
                                       wide range of issues, from specific examples to hypothetical situations, providing a
                                       valuable resource when considering their own business risks. participants also expressed
                                       interest in learning from shared cases where it is difficult for a company to come up with
                                       appropriate responses.

supply chain management


                               hitachi’s approach

                              growth in procurement from supply chains in emerging markets has
                              increased the impact of corporate activities on the economy,
                              environment, and societies of countries and regions worldwide. it has
                              also brought to light a number of problems, including the lack of proper
                              labor legislation in some emerging countries.
                                   as with human rights, hitachi places procurement activities high on
                              the agenda for managing global risks. we respect basic human and labor
                              rights in our procurement activities and ensure consistent activities
                              across the supply chain by sharing guidelines and communicating openly
                              with all of our suppliers—the codrivers of our operations.
                                   we conduct csr monitoring and audits with our suppliers to gauge how
                              well they understand hitachi’s csr initiatives. we have also created
                              procurement bcps to help us respond to natural disasters and other threats.



                                our actions in fiscal 2014
                                hitachi conducts its procurement activities based on the hitachi guidelines for
                                procurement activities, which are shared within the group. we share these and
                                other guidelines with our growing global network of suppliers, whom we ask to
                                carry out csr monitoring (self-checks), and take remedial action as needed. in
                                addition, we have procurement business continuity plans (bcps) in place globally
                                to minimize the impact of natural disasters and other contingencies.


                                  to ensure that suppliers are fully informed, we distribute the hitachi group supply
                                  chain csr deployment guidebook to about 23,000 suppliers.
                                  we have asked about 200 companies outside japan to conduct csr monitoring
                                  (self-checks) and carried out audits of 20 suppliers.
                                  group companies in japan are taking measures to improve procurement bcps.



            core policy        creating and sharing procurement policies

                              we base our procurement activities on the hitachi guidelines for procurement activities,
                              while sharing global supply chain issues within the group. all group companies follow
                              these guidelines. the guidelines were created in line with the united nations global
                              compact and include the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation as
                              well as all forms of child and forced labor.
                                      to help suppliers, as the codrivers of our operations, to understand hitachi’s supply

                                     given the global reach of hitachi’s business, there is a growing likelihood of supply chain
                                     risks creating management problems, and we are working hard to identify and mitigate
                                     these risks beforehand as much as possible. we established a csr/ecological
                                     procurement promotion center within the hitachi headquarters in fiscal 2011. we have
                                     also established the hitachi group csr green procurement committee, which includes
                                     committee members from in-house companies and key group companies. this completes
                                     a framework that will enable our csr supply chain management and green procurement
                                     philosophy and initiatives to be shared throughout the group.

                                     to procure parts and materials manufactured with reduced environmental impact, so that
                                     suppliers help to protect the environment, it is crucial that we share our commitment to
                                     environmentally conscious monozukuri craftsmanship throughout our entire supply chain. in
                                     fiscal 1998, we led the industry in developing green procurement guidelines to define our
                                     basic position on procuring parts and products that do not have a negative impact on the
                                     global environment, as well as our requirements of suppliers, so that we can work together
                                     to promote green procurement. the guidelines set out supplier requirements for
                                     environmental conservation, including building an environmental management system and
                                     acquiring certifications. there are also requirements for reducing the environmental impact
                                     of products supplied to hitachi, such as conserving resources and energy in production,
                                     recycling, managing chemical substances, and fully disclosing related information.
                                          there is a global trend toward tighter regulations on chemical substances. in fiscal
                                     2013, we reviewed our categories for controlled chemical substances in our green
                                     procurement guidelines to comply with the stipulations on restricted substances,
                                     authorized substances, and svhcs (substances of very high concern) in europe’s
                                     registration, evaluation, authorization, and restriction of chemicals (reach) regulation
                                     for managing chemical substances within the european union. specific changes include:
                                     (1) moving some chemicals to the prohibited substances list, (2) further breaking down the
                                     controlled substances list, and (3) adopting the industry association list. the previous
                                     guidelines were revised to version 7.0 and distributed through in-house and group
                                     companies to suppliers to ensure that they are fully informed. we have built a gree’net, an
                                     internet-based green procurement system, to collect information about chemical
                                     substances contained in products and other environment-related data from suppliers as
                                     soon as it becomes available. the goal is to manage chemicals carefully. under this

             core policy        response to the conflict minerals issue

                               the request to our suppliers, based on the conflict minerals procurement policy that
                               we released in september 2013, has been put up on our website as a clear statement
                               of our position.


                                  hitachi group conflict minerals procurement policy
                                 the hitachi group is committed to responsible procurement practices to mitigate the
                                 risk of sourcing conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold) that can directly or
                                 indirectly finance armed groups abetting human rights violations in the democratic
                                 republic of the congo (drc) and adjoining countries. the hitachi group procurement
                                 division strives to establish a sustainable supply chain that eliminates procurement of
                                 materials and/or parts using conflict minerals. our efforts are to continue procurement
                                 of minerals from responsible sources in the region and are not intended to implement a
                                 ban on procurement of minerals from the drc and adjoining countries.



                                  request to our suppliers
                                 to do so, it is important to enhance supply chain transparency and to strengthen
                                 responsible procurement of materials and parts. therefore, we expect our suppliers to
                                 agree to our conflict minerals procurement policy and to cooperate with us in our
                                 efforts to ensure procurement of conflict-free minerals. in accordance with the dodd-
                                 frank act*1 and the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises,*2 companies are
                                 required to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry and to exercise due
                                 diligence covering the entire supply chain to determine whether final products include
                                 conflict minerals which benefit armed groups.
                                         the hitachi group will examine its supply chain through a collaborative
                                 industrywide approach by utilizing the tool developed by eicc-gesi.*3 we expect our
                                 suppliers to adhere to our conflict minerals procurement policy and to cooperate with
                                 our supply chain investigation.
                                         as improved processes are introduced to eliminate conflict minerals from the
                                 supply chain, we will ask our suppliers to comply with such programs once they are
                                 developed, proven, and established (i.e., expansion of the conflict-free smelter*4 list,

 policies and frameworks        strengthening global partnerships

                               a key element of the hitachi group vision is to improve the competitiveness of our
                               value chain based on partnerships with our suppliers. given our business aim to expand
                               internationally, we need to extend our procurement globally, looking toward increasing
                               local production for local consumption. in fiscal 2011, we appointed procurement
                               officers to oversee local procurement in china, the rest of asia, europe, and the
                               americas.
                                       by fiscal 2012, our 15 international procurement offices had grown to 25. to expand
                               the pool of suppliers in emerging markets, we set up the china asia pacific procurement
                               headquarters, hitachi east asia ltd., in fiscal 2012 and built a global supply database in
                               fiscal 2013. in fiscal 2014, moreover, we launched a new global procurement scheme
                               using professional functions within the group (hitachi high-technologies corporation,
                               hitachi capital corporation, and hitachi transport system, ltd.) to reinforce our
                               responsiveness to csr risks, a growing concern as the supply chain expands globally.



        key approaches          implementation of csr monitoring (self-checks)

                               to monitor how well hitachi’s csr supply chain management philosophy has been
                               adopted by our suppliers, since fiscal 2007 we have asked key suppliers to conduct csr
                               monitoring (self-checks) using the jeita supply chain csr deployment guidebook and
                               detailed checklists. we collect and analyze the results and take any necessary remedial
                               action. since fiscal 2011, we have expanded the scope to include suppliers in china and
                               the rest of asia. in fiscal 2014, we asked 200 suppliers outside japan to conduct csr
                               monitoring (self-checks).

        key approaches        implementation of csr audits

                             since july 2012, we have been auditing suppliers in china and the rest of asia from
                             among the suppliers providing csr monitoring (self-check) results. in fiscal 2014, we
                             conducted csr audits of 20 suppliers, all of them in china.  for these audits, we
                             engage jaco and dnv,*1 the bsi, *2 and intertek certification,*3 experienced csr auditing
                             companies. our audits are based on the international sa8000 certification standard
                             developed by social accountability international (sai), an american csr evaluation
                             institution. these audits investigate our workplace practices, and an eicc-recognized
                             auditor checks suppliers’ performances on labor and human rights, health and safety, the
                             environment, and ethics. in fiscal 2014, audit results revealed no major infringements at
                             the 20 companies, but made note of some small areas needing improvement, such as
                             overtime work exceeding stipulated limits (18 companies), failure to conduct periodic
                             inspections of machinery and equipment (16), and insufficient management of hazardous
                             waste (10). we have asked these suppliers to submit improvement action plans and will be
                             working with and advising them until they complete the planned improvements.

                             *1 japan auditing and certification organization for environment and quality (jaco) and det norske veritas (dnv):
                                jaco is a japanese certification institution that provides a range of auditing services. for audits outside japan,
                                jaco develops and carries out joint audits with dnv, a third-party certification institution that provides
                                certification and other services. dnv, with 140 years of experience, is known as a risk management leader.
                             *2 british standards institution (bsi): an independent organization that offers specialized business services. founded
                                in 1901 as the engineering standards committee, it is the world’s oldest institute for national standards.
                             *3 intertek certification: with a presence in 40 countries across the globe, the intertek group provides a wide array
                                of certification services in every industrial field.


        key approaches        creation of procurement bcps

                             we have a deep involvement in social infrastructures in places where the suppliers who are
                             our business partners can be affected by major earthquakes and other natural disasters.
                                     these disasters can heavily impact not only our business operations and those of our
                             suppliers but also society as a whole. to minimize this impact, the procurement divisions in
                             key group and in-house companies in japan have created procurement business
                             continuity plans (bcps) that (1) standardize and use generic parts to make procurement as
                             flexible as possible; (2) cultivate multiple suppliers; (3) distribute production across several
                             locations; (4) budget inventory strategically; and (5) consider substitute products. to see
                             whether or not procurement bcps would be effective, we held desktop exercises to
                             discuss in a group what should be done during and after a disaster, making further
                             improvements as a result. in fiscal 2014, group companies in japan took the same steps
                             to improve procurement bcps. the initiative will expand to group companies outside
                             japan in fiscal 2015, contributing to the continuation of hitachi’s global operations.


        key approaches        increasing green procurement of office supplies

                             we are improving our green procurement rate—the ratio of environmentally conscious
                             products procured to total office supplies—by using a group-wide online procurement
                             system: the e-sourcing mall. this system has a range of environmentally conscious
                             products and promotes procurement by clearly labeling these products. in fiscal 2014, our
                             green procurement rate reached 89%.

diversity and inclusion


                                 hitachi’s approach

                                the globalization of markets and labor environments has increased the
                                diversity of our stakeholders, as is evident from aspects like the product
                                and service needs of our customers and the shifting work values of our
                                employees. with strong commitment by senior managers, we are
                                promoting diversity-oriented measures as a management strategy across
                                hitachi as part of efforts to boost our competitiveness and secure
                                talented employees to respond to this growing stakeholder diversity.
                                     we aim to enhance our diversity and inclusion, for instance by
                                introducing key performance indicators (kpis) to advance women in the
                                workplace, and to create a management system that takes full advantage
                                of the skills of each member of our multifaceted workforce.


                                  our actions in fiscal 2014
                                  entering the third stage of our diversity management roadmap, we have broadened
                                  the scope to include gender, age, nationality, disabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual,
                                  and transgender (lgbt) status. with regard to promoting women in the workforce, we
                                  are engaged in direct dialogue with female employees as part of efforts to fulfill our
                                  dual kpis of appointing female executives and increasing the number of female
                                  managers in japan to 1,000. we are also pursuing time- and location-free work as
                                  part of efforts to promote work-life management, while also advancing policies to
                                  reduce long overtime work hours. the hitachi group is working hard to employ people
                                  with disabilities, holding special hiring fairs and study meetings for group companies
                                  to share information.


                                    support for career advancement of women through such efforts as the hitachi group
                                    women leaders’ meeting and hitachi group career seminar for young women;
                                    achievement of a ratio of 3.7% of hitachi, ltd.’s management positions filled by
                                    women.
                                    promotion of time- and location-free work, such as by establishing satellite offices
                                    and simplifying work-from-home procedures, as part of efforts to improve work-life
                                    management.
                                    employment ratio of people with disabilities of 2.03% (as of june 2014), topping
                                    japan’s legally mandated ratio.



                              diversity management


            core policy          diversity statement

                                diversity is the wellspring of our innovation and our growth engine. hitachi regards
                                personal differences—namely, gender, nationality, work history, age, sexual orientation, and
                                philosophy—as facets of people’s individuality. by respecting our employees’ individualities
                                and positioning them as an advantage, hitachi frames its diversity and inclusion as
                                conducive to both the individual’s and the company’s sustainable growth. with strong
                                teamwork and broad experience in the global market, we will meet our customers’ needs.

        key approaches           diversity workshops and management training

                                since fiscal 2010, hitachi’s unique diversity workshops have been using the world café
                                approach*1 to bring together employees, including senior executives and young employees, to
                                freely exchange opinions on diversity and work-life management.
                                      it is necessary for the workplace as a whole to develop a better understanding of diversity
                                and put work-life management into practice. changing the mindsets of managers is a
                                particularly critical task. our diversity workshop approach gives managers the opportunity to
                                reflect on their management styles and consider how to optimize their employees’ potential to
                                achieve top results for the organization as a whole.
                                      since fiscal 2013, in-house companies and group companies have been using a
                                workshop handbook created in-house to hold their own workshops, raising the awareness of
                                individuals, and reform the work environment.

                                   them to share situations and cultural insight across organizations or communities to create new knowledge.




                              developing women’s careers


            core policy          kpi of developing women’s careers

                                hitachi has created two key performance indicators (kpis), announced externally in fiscal
                                2013, to enable as many female employees as possible to take up leadership positions and to
                                participate in management decision making. these kpis signal our commitment both
                                internally and to the world to further advance women in the workplace and to improve our
                                diversity management.
                                   in addition to reinforcing existing programs, we will use the hitachi group women’s career
                                success survey to highlight progress with new initiatives and outstanding issues in each
                                business unit and to set numerical targets for each unit, strengthening our management
                                commitment. we will also boost women’s individual ambitions and morale through programs
                                such as the hitachi group women leaders’ meeting, which targets female employees at the
                                general manager level and above. we intend to create an environment where as many women
                                as possible are able to optimize their potential in management positions.

                                        30 in-house and group companies. we use an external institution’s survey framework to
                                        quantify the status of these companies according to four indexes: female management
                                        appointments, work-life balance, gender equality, and advancement of women in the

                                        outstanding issues. participating companies use the results to formulate measures,
                                        including creating key performance indicators (kpis) to accelerate female employees’
                                        advancement in the workplace.

                                        employees thinking about their own careers early in life, helping them to dispel vague
                                        concerns about the future and to maintain a balance between work and life events. the
                                        goal is for women themselves to actively carve out their own careers.

           key approaches            initiation of pre-maternity leave and return-to-work support seminars

                                    at hitachi, with more employees balancing work and child care, since fiscal 2012 we have
                                    been running pre-maternity leave and return-to-work support seminars approximately
                                    three times every six months. these address such issues as putting careers on hold for
                                    childbirth and child care and concerns about balancing work with child care. employees
                                    attend seminars with their managers so that both can share attitudes and approaches

                                            the goal is to ensure a woman’s smooth return to work as well as understanding and
                                    support from her managers and from colleagues. participation in the seminars is growing
                                    yearly, with around 350 people from various companies in the hitachi group taking part in
                                    fiscal 2014.


           key approaches            boosting productivity and efficiency by reducing working hours

                                    hitachi is revising working styles, seeking to increase productivity through reduction of
                                    working hours. efforts include presenting reports on actual situations of long working
                                    hours and periodic follow-ups at meetings for senior managers of hr, establishing days
                                    where no overtime will be conducted, and sharing and discussing examples of positive
                                    work styles. in addition, each site has its own unique approach to encourage employees to
                                    inform their colleagues of the time to leave the office, post calendars to plan their
                                    vacations, take a paid holiday each month, and secure their “thinking time” during which
                                    they concentrate on their duties.
                                            it support has also arranged for the times pcs are turned on and off to be
                                    recorded, so that both managers and employees can check their working hours in real
                                    time. communication is being enhanced to improve work efficiency, such as by helping
                                    employees establish priority for their various tasks. the introduction of secure pcs and
                                    techniques for effectively using travel time have also allowed employees to fully utilize
                                    time they are at work but away from their desks. in addition, hitachi, ltd. and labor
                                    unions are collaborating to achieve 100% use of planned annual paid vacation and
                                    special incentive leave.


           key approaches            time- and location-free work

                                    hitachi has systems and processes that allow employees to choose flexible and diverse
                                    work styles unrestricted by time or location. this allows our diverse staff to produce results
                                    more efficiently. in addition to discretionary work, flextime, and work from home, these
                                    initiatives include satellite offices, simplified work-from-home procedures and applications,
                                    distribution of mobile tools such as smartphones, and a time- and location-free work page
                                    on our intranet providing information on diverse work styles.

                                     since fiscal 2010, we have held a group-wide work-life balance-up! (wlb-up!)
                                     month each november to inform employees of our work-life balance management
                                     approach. the goal of the program is to improve the quality of employees’ work and
                                     personal lives by boosting awareness of work-life management, developing a better

                                     needed for work-life management.
                                             group-wide activities include messages from top management, work style review
                                     declarations in workplaces from managers, surveys of work-life management, a weekly
                                     e-mail newsletter sent to all employees, and wlb-up! month posters. individual
                                     workplaces also operate their own programs, including wlb-up! meetings, the active use
                                     of video and web conferencing to share information, and campaigns encouraging
                                     employees to utilize annual leave.

                                      expanding hiring of people with disabilities
                core policy

                                     hitachi, ltd. and group companies in japan have worked hard to employ people with
                                     disabilities, such as by holding special hiring fairs and study meetings for group
                                     companies to share information. as a result, as of june 2014 the employment ratio of
                                     people with disabilities was 2.03% at hitachi, ltd. and 2.07% for the entire group in japan.
                                     both of these figures topped japan’s legally required employment rate of 2.0%. we will
                                     maintain our group-wide drive to hire more people with disabilities.

            key approaches                 promoting employment and understanding for people with mental disabilities

                                          in 2009, hitachi, ltd. was selected to participate in a model program of the ministry of
                                          health, labor, and welfare aimed at promoting employment for people with mental
                                          disabilities. since that time, we have applied the knowledge and know-how gained in this
                                          program toward boosting such employment across the entire hitachi group in japan. as
                                          of june 2014, there are 274 people with mental disabilities employed at group companies.
                                                  hitachi, ltd. has worked to bring attention to and promote understanding of these
                                          employees by holding workshops providing information on ways to support them. at the
                                          same time, we have provided employees with training necessary to help them manage
                                          their disabilities and keep them working. these hitachi and group company initiatives have
                                          received widespread attention through prefectural labor bureau seminars and annual

                                and complex ways. hitachi holds the health and safety of employees as
                                a top priority. we consider it our duty to give our workers an
                                environment where they can go about their duties safely and with peace
                                of mind. we take a group-wide approach to preventing accidents that
                                includes sharing the hitachi group health and safety policy globally,
                                using a system that tracks information on health and safety
                                management from all group companies in japan, and establishing key

                                hitachi is promoting a range of group-wide occupational health and safety activities. these
                                include preventing workplace accidents by setting and applying minimum safety standards
                                to be observed by group manufacturers around the globe and by taking into consideration
                                the specific conditions at each company. we respond quickly when an accident occurs and
                                use incidents to make improvements and boost the level of health and safety management.
                                     in fiscal 2011 we introduced the hitachi group key safety management designation
                                system. this initiative tracks key safety management improvements at hitachi group
                                companies and business sites in japan that have experienced serious work accidents. under
                                the leadership of top executives, these companies and business sites take on management-
                                driven and bottom-up initiatives to formulate and promote specific improvement plans. we are
                                also reshaping the group’s safety management framework and introducing targeted safety
                                measures, including extensive investigations of the cause of serious accidents, reviews of
                                risks to reduce potential accidents, and engagement of third parties with a high level of health
                                and safety expertise to diagnose safety issues. we are also working to comply with new
                                regulatory requirements regarding the stress check system and chemical risk assessment
                                system in japan, which are slated to go into effect in fiscal 2015 and 2016, respectively.

                                      in response to an increase in work-related accidents in fiscal 2014, hitachi president
                              and coo toshiaki higashihara in february 2015 led the hitachi group special safety
                              conference, which included around 120 executive officers and division chiefs in charge of
                              safety at hitachi group companies in japan. during the meeting participants considered
                              ways to bolster safety and preventive measures, such as by introducing new initiatives for
                              fiscal 2015, examining hitachi group policies, and providing examples of successful efforts
                              to date. these were then used by group companies to establish plans for preventing
                              workplace accidents.

            core policy        cooperating to improve health and safety

                              hitachi is dedicated to improving health and safety levels through employee-management
                              cooperation. this includes signing a collective agreement with the hitachi workers union
                              on the promotion of, among other things, health and safety mechanisms, a health and
                              safety commission, education and training programs, and health checks for employees.


        key approaches         sharing health and safety information in the hitachi group

                              we built the hitachi group health and safety portal system in 2012 to ensure that
                              every hitachi group company in japan can track the health and safety performance of
                              the entire hitachi group.
                                      group-wide information on work accidents is registered in the system so that
                              companies can track causes and see what preventive measures have been initiated. to
                              help prevent recurrences, statistics are kept on types of accidents. since 2014, we
                              have carried out initiatives to share information on workplace accidents globally,
                              including one that tracks and provides feedback on accidents occurring at group
                              companies outside of japan.
                                      once a year we hold the hitachi group health and safety research presentation
                              meeting for hitachi health and safety officers. the 58th gathering, held in november
                              2014, attracted around 150 participants, who shared newfound knowledge from case
                              studies and heard special lectures from outside experts on ways to improve health and
                              safety activities at companies. around 70 occupational healthcare workers, including
                              physicians and nurses, participated in the 14th hitachi group industrial health
                              conference in january 2015. participants presented research results, shared
                              information on methods for improving occupational health programs at business sites,
                              and discussed training approaches for relevant healthcare workers.

           key approaches              the hitachi group health and safety award program

                                      we have implemented the hitachi group health and safety award program to recognize
                                      group companies in japan that extend their accident-free records or that receive prizes for
                                      health and safety from external organizations. one such company is the information and
                                      telecommunication system company of the hitachi telecommunications and network
                                      systems division. the company, based in totsuka ward, yokohama city, has as of
                                      january 2014 extended its record of accident-free work-time hours to 150 million. by not
                                      recording a single work-time accident for approximately 37 years, it stands as the group’s
                                      top health and safety performer.


           key approaches              fatigue and stress checkup system

                                      hitachi systems, ltd. has initiated efforts to support employees returning to work
                                      after mental illness by using the fatigue and stress checkup system. this system
                                      makes it easier for employees to track their fatigue levels, thus allowing better self-
                                      care for their mental and physical health. this system was developed through an
                                      industry-university partnership in fiscal 2012 to care for the mental health of local

                                      technologies and utilizes an instrument that measures autonomic nervous system
                                      responses to detect the early signs of fatigue and stress.


                                    employee welfare


 policies and frameworks               improving employee welfare

                                      hitachi, ltd. has designed programs to support employees’ self-reliance and
                                      independence. these include housing support, such as dormitories, company housing,
                                      and a housing allowance system, as well as an asset-building savings program, an
                                      employee stock ownership program, group insurance, and consolation payments. in fiscal
                                      2000, a new “cafeteria plan” program was introduced, enabling employees to select the
                                      benefits they receive.
                                              under the initiative employees are able to tailor a plan to their individual lifestyles and
                                      needs by choosing from a list of options, such as skills development, child care, nursing
                                      care, health promotion, and donations. employees use “cafeteria points” to select the type
                                      of support they need when they need it.
                                              the hitachi group has fundamentally revamped its retirement and pension plans to
                                      reflect the diversification of postretirement lifestyles, changes in the employment system,
                                      and revisions to the legal system. defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans
                                      have been introduced across the group to provide support for employees’ diverse life-
                                      planning needs. the defined contribution pension plan encourages employees to
                                      participate in their postretirement planning by providing asset management and investment
                                      education, as well as other support. with the defined benefit pension plan, we increased
                                      the number of benefit options in response to employees’ varied needs.

global human capital development


                               hitachi’s approach

                              as the role of corporations expands with respect to global social issues
                              like the environment, poverty, and human rights, hitachi seeks to address
                              the needs and values of its diverse array of stakeholders, including central
                              and local governmental bodies, local communities, and customers, with
                              the goal of developing the social innovation business around the globe.
                                   in order to secure the human resources needed to deal with those
                              issues, we are seeking to globalize its human capital by recruiting and
                              training employees from a variety of countries, while also building up an
                              array of facilities around the world so that our diverse employees can
                              demonstrate their full potential and continually develop themselves.


                                our actions in fiscal 2014
                                hitachi has built the global human capital database to enable visualization of
                                worldwide human capital throughout the group, while also introducing a global
                                grading system as a common platform for group-wide job evaluations. we have
                                also introduced and expanded our performance management system to
                                continually improve and develop both our business and the individual skills of our
                                employees. on top of this, we have introduced common global hiring systems as
                                a way to secure talented personnel, boost efficiency, and reduce hiring costs.

                                  in fiscal 2015, we hired around 60 foreign nationals who had graduated from
                                  universities inside and outside japan, as well as around 20 japanese nationals who
                                  earned degrees at universities outside japan.
                                  a process was implemented to send results from the hitachi insights survey of global
                                  employees directly to managers.
                                  in fiscal 2013, employees in hitachi, ltd. and 20 group companies in japan received
                                  an average of 37.9 hours of training per person, and 85,300 yen per person was
                                  invested for education.



            core policy        advancing global human capital

                              our group-wide global human capital management strategy optimizes both human resources
                              and organizational performance in pursuit of hitachi’s goal of becoming a major global player.
                                    one example of our initiatives is the global human capital database covering all
                              hitachi group employees, excluding factory workers outside japan. this database
                              enables us to fully ascertain the status of worldwide group human capital and to assess
                              macro management data, such as the allocation of human resources. we have also built
                              a global grading system that applies to all managers in the hitachi group worldwide,
                              using it as a common platform for job evaluations throughout the entire group and as a
                              common standard for assessing the value of management duties.
                                    in addition, we introduced a performance management system at hitachi, ltd. and
                              at some group companies worldwide to link the operational business goals and
                              individual skills of both sides, with the aim of mutual sustained improvement and
                              growth. this system will be expanded to include more companies. with an eye to
                              supporting the advancement of employees as our global operations expand, we are

            core policy        global recruiting and globalizing human capital

                              as a means of opening up global markets, we have been accelerating the globalization of
                              human capital in japan through three initiatives: (1) recruiting personnel in japan who can
                              promote global operations, (2) providing more young japanese employees with experience
                              outside japan, and (3) comprehensively implementing globally unified management training.
                                      we are committed to securing the right personnel for business globalization, and
                              toward that end we are opening up employment opportunities and strengthening
                              management diversity. in principle, we categorize all employees graduating from
                              universities and technical colleges as global business personnel who can contribute to
                              driving our global operations. our priority for employing global business personnel is to
                              attract people who are eager to build their foreign language skills and relish the challenge
                              of working in different cultures, social settings, and work environments.
                                      we also recruit new employees to ensure diversity in and outside japan. in fiscal
                              2015, we recruited around 60 non-japanese from universities in japan and elsewhere, and
                              around 20 japanese graduates from universities outside japan.

                              providing young employees with global experience
                              hitachi maintains broad programs to systematically cultivate and secure people who can
                              succeed in global business. to develop the careers of people who can understand and
                              adapt to local cultures and lifestyles, we have offered a program for younger employees to
                              live outside japan. we have sent around 3,700 young group employees over the four
                              years beginning with fiscal 2011, allowing them to take part in more than 80 programs,
                              including understanding other cultures, language studies, local field studies, and
                              internships, as well as opportunities to work with local people to resolve social issues. we
                              plan to continue these programs in fiscal 2015.

                              globalizing management training
                              along with the rollout of global human capital management, we are also globalizing our
                              human capital development programs.
                                      we launched the global advanced program for leadership development (gap-l) in
                              2012 to develop leaders for our asian operations. in fiscal 2013, 23 participants from
                              around the world took part in the program in singapore. another 25 people participated in
                              the global leadership acceleration program for key positions (gap-k), which targets
                              management candidates, in delhi, india, and other locations. these programs focus on
                              global business expansion by creating customer value and the requisite leadership skills,
                              moving us closer to our goal of becoming a major global player. in the gap-k program in
                              particular, participants learn and discuss strategies for global business expansion with a
                              special emphasis on emerging markets.
                                      in fiscal 2014, the gap-l program had 21 participants, while 22 took part in gap-k.
                              we also initiated standard training courses for general managers and new managers for
                              roughly 2,000 people across our global group operations. as global human capital
                              management evolves to realize hitachi’s management strategies, we will globalize our
                              management development programs and continue to cultivate leaders to guide us toward
                              further growth.


            core policy        career development support

                              there are differences among individual employees with regard to what they find fulfilling in
                              their lives and careers. bearing this in mind, hitachi has developed a broad range of career
                              development support that focuses on employees’ “internal careers,” namely, their
                              individual values and views on the significance and meaning of their work. in addition to
                              ensuring that these individuals can fulfill their potential and maximize their creativity, our
                              aim is to link that individual growth to the positive outcomes and growth of the
                              organization, thereby enhancing our corporate value. along with promoting self-
                              understanding and fostering strong individuals with the independence and autonomy
                              needed to think and act for themselves, we also are providing support to create a
                              framework for the organization to benefit from the engagement and motivation of individual
                              employees and to enhance mutual understanding as a way of fostering the teamwork
                              needed to enhance organizational strength and performance.


            core policy        future initiatives for career development

                              in pursuit of becoming a major global player, we are prioritizing individual and
                              organizational performance. we create value built on employees’ individuality and personal
                              aspirations by implementing hitachi’s global performance management (gpm) grounded in
                              diversity and the individual. we are also committed to supporting career development by
                              fostering communication and mutual understanding between employees and their
                              organizations based on programs encouraging individual employees to take greater control
                              of developing their own careers. in these ways, we provide the resources and tools that
                              enable a wide range of people to work together with enthusiasm.

        key approaches        conducting a global employee survey

                             in 2013, we conducted our first global employee survey, hitachi insights, as a way of
                             measuring employee engagement.*1 in september 2014, the survey was administered for
                             the second time. around 190,000 employees worldwide were sent the survey in one of 13
                             different languages, and roughly 160,000 responses were received.
                                     overall, among the 13 categories, hitachi scored well in “pride in your company” and
                             “your supervisor’s management,” suggesting that employees are proud of hitachi and its
                             drive to become a major global player underpinned by sustainable growth. a poor score
                             for “resources and support” indicates that we can do better on the level of staffing as well
                             as information and resource tools.
                                     compared to the first survey, there were improvements in all of the categories, which
                             seems to demonstrate that forward-looking changes were made in each organization
                             within hitachi based on studying the results of the survey and implementing
                             improvements. looking forward, we intend to continue making improvements while
                             thoroughly adhering to the pdca (plan, do, check, act) cycle.
                                     in fiscal 2014, we also introduced a process whereby the survey results are directly
                             sent to section and department heads. these managers can use the results to ascertain
                             the situations for their respective teams and to improve engagement with the team through
                             communication with the members. the range of employees who will receive this direct
                             communication is being expanded in 2015, and we will also be providing assistance to the
                             section and department heads for actions they wish to take based on the survey output,
                             with an eye to further raising the level of engagement throughout hitachi.

                             *1 hitachi uses the term “engagement” to refer to employees’ understanding of the company’s strategies and
                                policies, as well as their job satisfaction and desire to take actions on their own initiative to bring about results.




        key approaches        career development in the workplace

                             because we regard the workplace as the center of career development, our career
                             development support emphasizes growth in daily work. hitachi’s global performance
                             management (gpm) uses performance planning, with employees and their supervisors
                             discussing and agreeing on short-term work goals. we also use career consultations for
                             gaining mutual understanding of medium- to long-term career plans, as well as training
                             and skills development to boost individual employees’ engagement and motivation and to
                             advance their careers in the workplace. repeating the gpm cycle improves individual
                             performance and further increases motivation and creativity. this in turn spurs individual
                             growth and improves organizational results.
                                     hitachi administers the career counseling center to provide work-related advice to
                             employees as part of our career development support. trained counselors at the center
                             engage in dialogue to help employees proactively address their own concerns related to
                             their careers and relations with colleagues. some of those concerns include the desire to
                             find a career path that suits their aptitudes and values or to find a way to better balance
                             work with their private lives. the counselors at the center are also required to regularly
                             participate in a training program following a us-certified career counseling curriculum in
                             order to raise the quality of their counseling.

        key approaches        promoting career development workshops

                             together with workplace career development, we provide direct support for individual
                             career development through education and workshops that encourage employee
                             awareness of their “internal careers”—in other words, their reasons for working and the
                             significance they place on it. these programs are geared to individuals’ career
                             development and stages, covering everyone from young employees to more senior
                             workers. the hitachi career development workshop (h-cdw), launched in fiscal 2002 as
                             an initiative across group companies in japan, is a key program that targets middle-aged
                             employees who have work experience and who play a central role in the workplace.
                                     in fiscal 2014, hitachi began recommending that all employees promoted to
                             supervisory positons attend the h-cdw, with the aim of giving them the opportunity to
                             participate in the workshop at an earlier stage in their careers. participants use self-
                             analysis to deepen their self-understanding with an emphasis on their “internal careers,”
                             affirming their career direction, goals, and paths so that they can direct the development of
                             their own career and skills.
                                     hitachi is providing career development support to middle-aged employees through
                             life plan training, made available to employees 50 years or older (or managerial
                             employees from the age of 45), as well as the life plan briefing for employees who have
                             reached the age of around 58. life plan training is aimed at encouraging employees to
                             think for themselves about how they can take actions and make preparations for their
                             career and life plans, rather than waiting until they reach retirement age. toward that end,
                             the training provides various knowledge that is useful when considering styles of working
                             and living, as well as information on company support systems. for the life plan briefing,
                             prior to selecting their “life plan” regarding working styles after retiring at age 60,
                             participants receive an explanation about an array of working styles and life environments
                             for the elderly, while also taking part in workshops to consider those future working styles.

quality assurance activities


                                hitachi’s approach

                               hitachi understands that even a single product defect could pose a
                               significant business risk, given society’s increasing awareness of safety
                               and security issues and the growing global reach of businesses, and
                               reflects this in company management. the entire hitachi group
                               contributes to quality assurance as part of the tradition of monozukuri
                               craftsmanship from the customer’s perspective. these contributions
                               cover all processes from research and development through to after-sales
                               service. moreover, we promote activities to improve quality assurance
                               centered in the areas of organization and management, technologies, and
                               human resources. regarding the latter in particular, we provide training
                               for engineers in japan and work to develop human capital outside japan.

                                 our actions in fiscal 2014
                                 in fiscal 2014, under the hitachi group qf (quality first) innovation movement
                                 launched in fiscal 2010, we continued our initiatives to ensure product safety,
                                 compliance with laws and regulations, human resource development, and quality
                                 improvements. to develop the quality assurance skills of employees around the globe,
                                 in particular, we are increasing training opportunities in china and the rest of asia, as
                                 well as other countries and regions.


                                   more than 70,000 hitachi engineers went through an e-learning program that drew on
                                   the results of analyses of past product accidents.
                                   we provide reliability training courses in china and thailand.

                                           meaning “gleaning” in english, ochibo hiroi identifies the root causes of product accidents
                                           and recurrence prevention measures. the quality assurance executive officer works with
                                           related divisions to delve deeply into the technical causes as well as the procedures and
                                           the organizational and psychological factors that led to the accident, thereby identifying
                                           root causes and developing measures to prevent recurrence.


                                           intensive risk assessment
                                           hitachi is committed to quality and reliability, delivering safe products and services by
                                           combining expertise and technologies from such varied areas as planning, research, design,
                                           manufacturing, quality assurance, and maintenance. the safety of our customers’ life, health,
                                           and property are the top priorities in product development. therefore, we verify safety at every
                                           step, from development and production to sales, and conduct risk assessments from a wide
                                           perspective in collaboration with related manufacturing plants and research laboratories.

                                           to supply our customers with products that they can use with confidence, we comply with all
                                           product safety and technical laws, including those covering environmental consciousness and
                                           safety labels. we distribute information on product regulations worldwide, along with
                                           amendment trends and enforcement dates, among hitachi group companies. we have also
                                           created compliance guidelines to share within the entire group. the guidelines focus, among
                                           other things, on clarifying product-specific laws (product-specific laws map); on regulatory
                                           compliance activities and continuous improvement of processes, based on our compliance
                                           management system, designed to satisfy the 2008 iso 9001 standards; and on compliance
                                           education, as well as raising compliance awareness.


 policies and frameworks                       handling product accidents

                                           if there is a product accident, the division responsible acts swiftly to resolve the problem
                                           from the customer’s perspective, coordinating with other hitachi business units as needed.
                                           for an especially serious accident, we report to government agencies, as we are legally
                                           required to do, and publish the incident information on our website and through other
                                           channels. at the same time, we quickly submit a status report to top management,
                                           ensuring fast and appropriate remedial action not just at the company directly involved but
                                           all companies across the group.

                             quality assurance cover reliability (basic and advanced) and product safety. in fiscal 2011,
                             we reinforced our monozukuri practices by beginning an e-learning program for the more
                             than 120,000 hitachi engineers around the world. since fiscal 2012, we have operated
                             another e-learning program that draws on the results of analyses of past product accidents
                             to identify weaknesses that our engineers must be able to ascertain, understand, and
                             overcome in their daily work. over 70,000 engineers have gone through the program.
                                  quality assurance (qa) training centers at our manufacturing sites help to increase
                             production, quality assurance, and maintenance skills through their own specialized

                             as production volume has been increasing in china and other asian nations, we are
                             reinforcing systems and training to improve product quality from these locations. for
                             example, we host conferences for qa managers in china and thailand to improve quality
                             awareness and to share information and best practices.
                                  to develop employees’ qa skills and to improve their quality awareness and inspection
                             techniques, we provide reliability training courses at three levels in beijing, shanghai, and
                             guangzhou in china and in bangkok, thailand: the basic reliability course,*1 intermediate
                             reliability course,*2 and advanced reliability course. in the advanced reliability course,
                             managers hold group discussions on past product accidents to identify the root causes,
                             including the process-related, organizational, and psychological factors. the goals are to
                             boost problem identification and problem-solving skills.

                             *1 basic reliability course: deepens understanding of such basic issues as hitachi’s monozukuri craftsmanship,
                                quality management, and labor safety.
                             *2 intermediate reliability course: improves understanding of more practical issues in, for example, hitachi
                                monozukuri craftsmanship, iso 9001 certification, defect elimination, design for reliability, and purchasing and
                                vendor management.



        key approaches        ensuring home appliance safety

                             we are reducing consumer appliance accidents to near zero levels in line with hitachi’s
                             customer satisfaction (cs) management guidelines, which set avoidance of all product
                             accidents as the baseline. for example, since fiscal 1987 we have been testing worst-case
                             scenarios, such as deliberately setting a fire inside a product to confirm that the fire will not
                             spread outside it. since fiscal 2006, we have also been conducting product safety risk
                             assessments at the development stage, creating “accidents” that might be caused by misuse.
                                  of the fires in electrical products that occurred in japan during fiscal 2014, room air
                             conditioner accidents (including outside units) were the most common, accounting for 64
                             incidents.*1 no hitachi air conditioners were involved in these accidents, reflecting the strength
                             of the hitachi group qf innovation movement. we will continue to make all our consumer
                             appliances even safer using our own voluntary action plan for product safety so that customers
                             can use our products with confidence.

                             *1 according to the ministry of economy, trade, and industry’s “fiscal 2013 report on status of product safety policy
                                initiatives” (june 30, 2014).

customer satisfaction


                              hitachi’s approach

                             for the company to grow sustainably, it is vital to respond to diversifying
                             customer needs and values, as well as to contribute to a society where
                             everyone—including the young and old, as well as those with
                             disabilities—can live conveniently and comfortably. as a company that
                             offers a broad range of products and services from home appliances to
                             social infrastructure, hitachi believes that it is important to engage in
                             corporate activities with the people at large in mind, not just the
                             corporate customers and individual consumers with whom it directly
                             conducts business.
                                 to improve customer satisfaction (cs), we have created customer
                             satisfaction management guidelines. we share customers’ voices
                             obtained through direct dialogue across the whole group, reflecting them
                             in our management, product, and solution strategies. furthermore, we
                             incorporate the views of product users and experts into our universal
                             design (ud) approach.


                               our actions in fiscal 2014
                               hitachi makes ongoing efforts across the group to boost cs by building closer
                               relations with customers, primarily through staff in the sales and marketing
                               division. in fiscal 2014, we held the hitachi innovation forum and various other
                               lectures and seminars as opportunities for direct dialogue with customers. our
                               website provides comprehensive customer support, and we capitalize on the
                               feedback we receive to improve our business operations, products, and services.
                               we have also continued to promote ud with the end goal of a society where
                               everyone can live conveniently and comfortably.


                                 in fiscal 2014, 85 hitachi group company employees took the web inquiry
                                 responsiveness improvement course to learn how to better handle inquiries,
                                 bringing the total number of participants to 649 since the course began in 2009.
                                 the electric home appliances customer satisfaction division received approximately
                                 2.3 million instances of customer feedback in fiscal 2014.
                                 we conduct semiannual customer service evaluation surveys at some 90 service
                                 centers in japan.

           frameworks            reflecting customers’ voices

                                our sales and marketing division uses customer input in developing management,
                                product, and solution strategies. we identify key customers who will help grow our
                                business, then assign an account manager (am) to each one. the ams serve as
                                customers’ “portals” into hitachi group companies in japan, and the whole group works
                                with them to build closer relations with customers and to boost customer satisfaction.
                                        our hokkaido, tohoku, chubu, and kansai area operations hold executive seminars for
                                local customers. through direct dialogue with customers participating in our seminars and
                                lectures, we incorporate their expectations for hitachi and their opinions into product strategies.
                                        we also hold the hitachi innovation forum, which includes lectures, business sessions,
                                seminars, and exhibits showcasing new businesses and initiatives targeting social
                                innovation. project leaders explain details to customers to deepen their understanding of
                                hitachi’s business. we use feedback from this forum to improve our operations.
                                        our r&d technology community program provides opportunities for creation through
                                collaboration with customers. project leaders invite customers to their research labs to see
                                exhibits of products and systems currently being developed.


           frameworks            providing customer support online

                                hitachi offers comprehensive customer support on its website. this enables us to process
                                customer inquiries, opinions, requests, and complaints—in collaboration with the customer
                                support offices of hitachi group companies in japan—to improve our business operations,
                                as well as our products and services. we also conduct training courses to provide better
                                handling of these inquiries.
                                        as one initiative, we have been holding the web inquiry responsiveness improvement
                                course since fiscal 2009. in fiscal 2014, 85 hitachi group company employees took the

                                responses to inquiries. going forward, we will strengthen coordination among group
                                companies to respond more quickly and effectively to customer inquiries, using the
                                website as an important contact tool.

 policies and frameworks                    promoting universal design

                                           we promote universal design (ud) with a focus on three aspects of our products: their
                                           quality of use, their accessibility, and their entire lifecycle. quality of use means focusing on
                                           the traits that make people feel that the product is easy and enjoyable to make a part of
                                           their lives. accessibility refers to the range of people who can use a product or service.
                                           and the lifecycle covers all the customer-relevant stages of the value chain, from product
                                           purchase through to disposal.
                                                   we conduct basic research on users’ behavioral and cognitive characteristics to
                                           formulate ud guidelines and reflect these in product development, incorporating input from
                                           users and experts at every stage. the information obtained during product development
                                           goes into a database shared by our businesses in japan. we also distribute some of this
                                           information externally to promote open-source standardization and education.


             key approaches                 increasing ud products in digital and home appliances

                                           we define people as customers as soon as a product interests them, and therefore make a
                                           point of considering ud concepts in all stages, from presales to disposal. key attributes
                                           are usability, features, harmony with the environment, safety, and maintenance. our
                                           intention is to provide products that suit the physical capabilities and lifestyles of all
                                           customers and are appreciated for a long time.

                                                   our ud focus extends beyond products to include product manuals. for example, to
                                           allow the visually impaired to use our products safely and easily, we are working with the
                                           npo kanagawa information, employment, and welfare network for the visually impaired
                                           (view-net kanagawa) to make our manuals available as audio text files.
                                                   the entire manual, including photographs, diagrams, and tables, is converted into a
                                           text file that can be played aloud using text-to-speech software (a screen reader for the
                                           visually impaired) and made available online. the text files are created based on feedback
verifying audio text files for product     from visually impaired people who have operated and verified product use while listening to
operation.

                                                   we have also launched a range of measures to improve the accessibility of

            key approaches                bringing ud to public equipment and systems

                                         public equipment and systems are used by a large number of people, including children,
                                         either individually or collectively, in public spaces like government buildings, stations,
                                         railways, and hospitals. product design must address not only ease of use but also
                                         security, privacy, and safety.
                                                 for example, our automated teller machines (atms) include considerations and ideas
                                         based on a human-centric approach aimed at producing a machine that a range of people
                                         can operate in the same way with ease and without any particular concern. the arched guide

                                         vision, has received color universal design certification*1 from the npo color universal
                                         design organization (cudo).

                                         *1 cudo color universal design certification: granted where the color schemes used in products and facilities, etc.,
                                            are tested and found to be consistent with cudo standards for color ud, the concept of designing products
                                            and facilities for universal ease of use, regardless of people’s differences in color perception. the aim of the
                                            cudo certification system is to contribute to the public good by creating a society that accommodates
                                            individuals’ differences.

            key approaches                increasing ud products in web and information systems

                                         web and information systems are essential for gathering information and communicating.
                                         for users with disabilities who have difficulty accessing information, it is particularly
                                         important to make systems accessible, usable, and secure. hitachi promotes ud that
                                         ensures accessibility in our web and information systems by using the international web
                                         content accessibility guidelines (wcag) 2.0.*1 examples include screens and layouts that

                                         feature that allows people to alter font size and color.
                                                 the assistance for color generation by css3 (css3 generator) tool uses css3,*2

communication with shareholders and investors


                               hitachi’s approach

                              dialogue between corporations and investors is increasingly dynamic. to
                              promote sustainable corporate growth and to enhance corporate value
                              over the medium to long term, the japanese government formulated
                              japan’s stewardship code in 2014 and the corporate governance code
                              in 2015, the former laying down a set of principles for investors and the
                              latter for corporations.
                                   in addition to disclosing our management strategies, financial
                              information, and other information in a fair and appropriate manner based
                              on our disclosure policy, we communicate with our shareholders and
                              investors through one-on-one meetings, investor relations (ir) events,
                              and the annual general meeting of shareholders. with an eye to pursuing
                              hitachi’s sustainable growth, moreover, we disclose non-financial
                              information to enhance the transparency of our business activities and
                              ensure that the company is evaluated from a long-term perspective.



                                our actions in fiscal 2014
                                hitachi engages in a wide range of ir activities, including business strategy meetings
                                for institutional investors and analysts, tours of plants and research laboratories, and
                                one-on-one meetings. in fiscal 2014, we held briefings on our progress with the 2015
                                mid-term management plan and hosted an ir event presenting the business strategies
                                of key businesses under the plan.


                                  hosted hitachi ir day 2014, where senior management explained their business
                                  strategies and management policies.
                                  conducted approximately 740 one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and
                                  analysts worldwide.



            core policy        ensuring information disclosure

                              we communicate with shareholders and investors based on our disclosure policy. we
                              disclose not only information required by laws or regulations, but also information that
                              promotes deeper stakeholder understanding of our management policies and
                              business activities.

   disclosure policy
  1   basic policy
      hitachi’s mission is to contribute to society through the development of superior, original technology and products.
      with this in mind, hitachi seeks to maintain and develop trust relationships with its stakeholders, including
      shareholders and other investors, customers, business partners, employees, and regional communities. it will fulfill
      its responsibility to stakeholders by disclosing information in a fair and highly transparent manner and by
      conducting various communication activities.
  2   information disclosure standards
      hitachi discloses information as appropriate in a fair and highly transparent manner, in compliance with the law and/or
      regulations of the stock exchanges on which the company is listed. hitachi discloses not only information required
      by law and/or regulation, but also management and financial information it regards as useful in deepening
      stakeholder understanding of hitachi management policy and business activities. hitachi also discloses non-financial
      information regarding the social and environmental impact of its activities. hitachi’s stance on disclosure recognizes
      that society regards the above information as important.
  3   disclosure methods
      hitachi uses appropriate means to disclose the information required by law and/or regulations of the stock
      exchanges on which the company is listed. the company also posts this information on its website immediately
      after it is disclosed. hitachi also discloses information not required by law and/or regulations by distributing news
      releases, holding press conferences and presentations, posting information on its website, and conducting other
      disclosure activities in an appropriate, precise, and timely manner.
  4   quiet period
      hitachi stipulates a quiet period of a certain length prior to earnings announcements to prevent information leaks
      and to maintain disclosure fairness. during this period, hitachi refrains from answering inquiries about business
      performance and related matters.
  5   forward-looking statements
      in its disclosures, hitachi may make statements that constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management’s
      views with respect to certain future events and financial performance at the time of disclosure and include any
      statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. such statements are based on information
      available at the time of disclosure and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. certain forward-looking statements
      are based upon assumptions of future events which may not prove to be accurate. hitachi discloses the factors that
      could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in forward-looking statements.



             core policy           fundamental policy against takeovers

                                  the group invests a great deal of business resources in fundamental research and in
                                  the development of market-leading products and businesses that will bear fruit in the
                                  future, and realizing the benefits from these management policies requires that they
                                  be continued for a set period of time. for this purpose, the company keeps its
                                  shareholders and investors well informed of not just the business results for each
                                  period but also of the company’s business policies for creating value in the future.
                                          the company does not deny the significance of the vitalization of business activities
                                  and performance that can be brought about through a change in management control, but
                                  it recognizes the necessity of determining the impact on company value and the interests
                                  of all shareholders of the buying activities and buyout proposals of parties attempting to
                                  acquire a large share of stock of the company or a group company by duly examining the
                                  business description, future business plans, past investment activities, and other
                                  necessary aspects of such a party.

                                      there is no party that is currently attempting to acquire a large share of the
                              company’s stocks nor is there a specific threat, neither does the company intend to
                              implement specified so-called anti-takeover measures in advance of the appearance of
                              such a party, but the company does understand that it is one of the natural duties
                              bestowed upon it by the shareholders and investors to continuously monitor the state of
                              trading of the company’s stock and then to immediately take what the company deems to
                              be the best action in the event of the appearance of a party attempting to purchase a large
                              share of the company’s stock. in particular, together with outside experts, the company
                              will evaluate the buyout proposal of the party and hold negotiations with the buyer, and if
                              the company deems that said buyout will not maintain the company’s value and is not in
                              the best interest of the shareholders, then the company will quickly determine the
                              necessity, content, etc., of specific countermeasures and prepare to implement them. the
                              same response will also be taken in the event a party attempts to acquire a large
                              percentage of the shares of a group company.


        key approaches         promoting dialogue through the general meeting of shareholders

                              at the ordinary general meeting of shareholders, we provide audiovisual reports
                              designed to give shareholders a thorough understanding of our situation. after the
                              general meeting of shareholders, we disclose management policy explanations from
                              our president for shareholders and investors via our website. to give stakeholders
                              ample time to consider our proposals, we post notices of annual general meetings of
                              shareholders earlier than legally required on our website, as well as delivering them to
                              shareholders by postal mail. supplementary information on the proposals is also

        key approaches        promoting a proactive ir approach

                             our investor relations (ir) activities include business strategy meetings for institutional
                             investors and analysts, tours of plants and r&d facilities, participation in brokerage-
                             sponsored investor meetings, and one-on-one meetings with investors and analysts.
                                     in fiscal 2014, we held quarterly financial results briefings and corporate strategy
                             meetings on our progress with the 2015 mid-term management plan. following on from
                             fiscal 2013, we hosted hitachi ir day 2014, where senior management explained their
                             business strategies and management policies under the plan. feedback from institutional
                             investors and analysts was positive. their comments included, “i was able to really see
                             that the hitachi group aspires to being a global company,” and “it was a productive day in

social contribution activities


                               hitachi’s approach

                              modern society faces a wide range of societal issues, including the
                              environment, poverty, and human rights infringement, and it requires the
                              power of society as a whole to solve these issues. as business activities
                              are becoming increasingly globalized, we believe that an important role
                              for a company is not only to contribute to society through its business
                              activities but also to get involved as a community member in the local
                              communities where it does its business.
                                   we promote activities in the key areas on which our policy on social
                              contribution activities focuses: human development, the environment, and
                              community support. through our technologies and know-how, we also
                              seek to contribute to solving societal issues together with other
                              organizations, including municipalities and npos.



                                our actions in fiscal 2014
                                in fiscal 2014, we revised our policy on social contribution activities based on our own
                                csr management framework. many of our employees proactively organized and
                                participated in community-oriented events and activities in various places worldwide
                                where hitachi has operations.
                                        on april 1, 2015, the five foundations in japan long supported by hitachi merged
                                into a new foundation, the hitachi global foundation, to further develop their
                                activities together.


                                  provided 2,327 million yen in funding for social contribution activities.
                                  launch of the hitachi global foundation.



            core policy        revision of policy on social contribution activities

                              in fiscal 2014, we revised our policy on social contribution activities based on our own csr
                              management framework. with the new group-wide policy on social contribution activities, we
                              will proactively promote our activities. the engine of our various businesses including social
                              innovation is not only driven by hitachi’s efforts to build a relationship with communities as a
                              corporate citizen but also by our employees’ flexible mindset and motivation brought about by
                              volunteer activities. we believe that these initiatives enable us to contribute to the
                              development of sustainability in both our business and society as a whole.
                                      as one of hitachi’s global efforts, we introduced the hitachi volunteer day in 2012. to
                              mark the international volunteer day on december 5 each year, we set every november
                              and december as a period during which we further encourage our employees to organize
                              and take part in a broad range of volunteer activities to contribute to their communities.
                                      in fiscal 2014, the total funding of the social contribution activities implemented
                              worldwide by hitachi and the five foundations in japan was approximately 2,327 million yen.

                                 on april 1, 2015, five foundations in japan long supported by hitachi, namely, the odaira
                                 memorial hitachi education foundation, the kurata memorial hitachi science and
                                 technology foundation, the hitachi environment foundation, the hitachi scholarship
                                 foundation, and the hitachi mirai foundation, merged into a new single foundation called
                                 the hitachi global foundation. the aim of this launch is for the hitachi global foundation
                                 to develop the activities respectively undertaken by each of the five foundations to further
                                 meet societal needs.
                                         while inheriting the philosophies of the five foundations, the hitachi global foundation
                                 plans to promote activities in three key areas: (1) human development, (2) promotion of
                                 academic research, science and technology, and environmental preservation, and
                                 (3) support of local communities, utilizing hitachi’s experience and know-how.

           key approaches                 social contribution activities in japan

                                         supporting young people’s curiosity at the ibaraki children’s university
                                         hitachi research laboratory, hitachi, ltd., has been dispatching researchers to serve as
                                         instructors at the ibaraki children’s university, a program run by the north ibaraki lifelong
                                         learning center. the company is providing support by having these instructors give
                                         upper-grade elementary school students easy-to-understand explanations of highly
                                         specialized technologies and know-how. ibaraki children’s university was launched in
                                         fiscal 2014 by ibaraki prefecture as a consortium that expands children’s intellectual
                                         horizons by sparking their curiosity and answering their questions. instructors include
                                         university professors and company researchers. the aim is to give participating students
                                         comprehensive knowledge through their studies, thereby fostering their creative power and
                                         helping them develop the ability to solve problems themselves.
                                                 in november 2014, a course titled “learning about new technologies that will open
                                         up the future” was offered at the omika site of the hitachi research laboratory. six hitachi
                                         employees participated, including one as course instructor. the employees provided the
                                         roughly 80 students gathered for the course with instruction on the topics of radiation and
                                         nuclear power generation, as well as related technologies. elementary school participants in
                                         ibaraki children’s university praised the course for explaining these topics in a way that was
                                         fun and easy to understand. plans call for this activity to continue for three years.


                                         the black jack seminar: deepening understanding of medical work
                                         since 2013, hitachi general hospital and johnson & johnson k.k. have teamed up to
                                         offer the annual black jack seminar that provides junior high school students in hitachi
                                         city with hands-on experience related to the work of medical professionals. the aim is to
                                         raise the students’ interest in medicine by giving them the chance to manipulate the actual
                                         medical equipment used for surgery. the lack of medical staff at hospitals has been
the black jack seminar held at hitachi
general hospital.
                                         identified as a major issue facing japan’s medical field, and the role of the seminar is to
                                         convey to students the importance of the profession so that area students will have more
                                         knowledge to draw on when later deciding their own career paths.
                                                 at the seminar held at hitachi general hospital in august 2014, 36 junior high school
                                         students received training in suture techniques, ultrasound scalpel operation, and the use
                                         of laparoscopes, as well as the chance to conduct simulated surgeries, tour the operating
                                         room, and learn about first-aid techniques.
                                                 feedback from participating students included the comments that the seminar
                                         provided “a valuable experience that can’t be gained in daily life” and that it was an
                                         “opportunity to think about my future.”

                                         since fiscal 2011, the hitachi science seminar program has been encouraging children’s
                                         interest in science. in hands-on programs, hitachi group companies involve children in
                                         science experiments and projects in an enjoyable way, sharing with the next generation the
                                         skills and know-how developed through our long monozukuri tradition. the seminar
                                         courses cover a wide range of topics, from materials familiar to children in their daily lives

                                                 in fiscal 2014, hitachi group companies held seven hitachi science seminars at the
                                         science museum in tokyo. the seminars drew 135 elementary and junior high school
                                         students. the hitachi organizations involved in running the seminars included the central
                                         research laboratory of hitachi, ltd., infrastructure systems company, and hitachi
                                         chemical co., ltd. for its seminar, hitachi chemical invited kazuhiro miyamoto, a teacher
                                         at kaisei academy, a junior and senior high school in tokyo, to conduct experiments that
                                         included creating bath powder from citric acid and baking powder and making a super ball
                                         by adding salt to laundry starch containing polyvinyl alcohol. in the sphere of biology, guest
                                         instructor tatsuo motokawa, professor emeritus at the tokyo institute of technology,
                                         presented a seminar on fun ways to learn about the biological mechanisms of living
                                         creatures. hitachi will continue to draw on the technologies and strengths of group
                                         companies for educational support programs that address diverse themes to foster
                                         children's curiosity.

                                         workshops with sumida aquarium to nurture students’ scientific minds
                                         hitachi chemical co., ltd. has teamed up with sumida aquarium in tokyo since 2013 to
                                         hold a series of small-group workshops titled “discovering the mysteries of water
                                         creatures.” in fiscal 2014, nine workshops were held, with around 60 elementary school
                                         students participating.
                                                 observers note that elementary school teachers in japan tend to have backgrounds in
participants in the “discovering the
mysteries of water creatures” event at
                                         the humanities, rather than science, so there are few teachers able to teach science and
sumida aquarium.                         conduct experiments in a proactive, creative way. this lack of teachers specializing in
                                         science is thought to be one of the reasons that interest in science has been declining
                                         among japanese children. the workshop series was brought about by the collaboration
                                         between hitachi chemical, which has experience in planning and conducting science-
                                         related programs, and sumida aquarium, which is interested in offering programs that can
                                         spark participants’ interest in science. the workshops give children an opportunity to
                                         encounter science outside of school, in the hope that these events will spark their interest
                                         and lead some of them to later pursue a scientific career. we plan to continue these kinds
                                         of efforts to nurture children’s scientific minds and understanding of the value of life.


                                         supporting science and math education in hitachi city
                                         the city of hitachi’s educational objectives are to foster an interest in science and to
                                         cultivate the creativity and originality of children on an international stage. hitachi, ltd.
                                         approves of these objectives, and in fiscal 2009 concluded a basic agreement to work with
                                         the city on programs that enrich science and mathematics education. the hitachi science
                                         club, an npo established by former employees of hitachi, is involved in this effort to

                                         improve education in science and mathematics. in fiscal 2014, the club conducted six
                                         different programs.
                                                 the club dispatches volunteers called rika-shitsu no ojisan (mr. science) to teach an
                                         experiment-based course two times a week to elementary school students in hitachi city,
                                         offering them a fun way to learn about science. another program is the super science and
                                         math academy held on school holidays, providing high-level instruction to junior high
                                         school students with a strong interest in science and mathematics. a particularly popular
                                         aspect of the program is the monozukuri workshops, where students and former hitachi
                                         engineers build devices like water-powered rockets made from plastic bottles, windmills,
                                         and propeller-driven cars.
                                                 these initiatives are based on the view that children naturally tend to be familiar with
                                         nature and science, but are moving away from science because of a lack of first-hand
                                         opportunities. this makes it important for them to be exposed to science while in
                                         elementary school in order to foster their scientific dreams.

                                         hitachi volunteer seminars: the first step in social contribution
                                         since 2002, hitachi, ltd. has been holding hitachi volunteer seminars for group
                                         employees and their families for them to experience volunteering and regularly participate
                                         in volunteer activities. in fiscal 2014, 148 people participated in the five workshops, which
                                         included information about rice planting and harvesting in the town of motegi in tochigi
                                         prefecture and about volunteer work at the setagaya museum of art.

volunteer seminar activities.
                                                 the seminars were designed around three main points: (1) ease of participation,
                                         (2) small size for deeper interaction with the instructors, and (3) content that leads
                                         participants to actually engage in volunteer work. in collaboration with the tokyo voluntary
                                         action center, the seminars introduced a variety of activities that suit the social
                                         contribution activities policies of hitachi, which are centered on education, the
                                         environment, and community support. to let as many hitachi employees as possible
                                         participate despite their busy schedules, the seminars were scheduled on the evenings of
                                         no-overtime days or on holidays so that family members could also participate.
                                                 feedback from employees who participated in the seminars included the following
                                         comments: “i’m interested in volunteer work, but until now i haven’t had an opportunity to get
                                         involved. i’m really grateful for this chance”; “since i don’t have any volunteer experience i
                                         was worried that i wouldn’t be of much help, but participating in the seminar made me more

                                          companies are located in china. the program involves hitachi employees volunteering to
                                          visit and give lessons on the environment to schoolchildren. the aim of the program is to

                                          schools to get connected to society, according to teachers from the schools where the
                                          lessons were carried out.

                                    in fiscal 2014, the hitachi group began working with the ipe,*1 a chinese
                                    nongovernmental organization focused on environmental issues. with the help of the ipe,
                                    we urge suppliers in china whose operations may be polluting the environment to improve
                                    their environmental performance. following interviews with these suppliers, the group
                                    companies being supplied, the procurement departments of the hitachi head and
                                    shanghai offices, and the environment department of the beijing office have worked
                                    together to take appropriate measures and provide support in consultation with the ipe.
                                    we will continue to monitor our suppliers and take necessary measures, receiving updated
                                    lists from the ipe every six months, to help improve china’s environment.

                                     building trust and strengthening global human capital

                                    establishing trust with such diverse stakeholders as governments, local authorities,
                                    regional communities, and nongovernmental organizations enables hitachi to respond to
                                    the changing global society and is the base of all csr activities. at the same time, as a
                                    global company, it is imperative that hitachi uphold the rights of all stakeholders.
                                            we integrate diversity into our use of human capital and work to enhance recruitment
                                    and development of global human capital. we also conduct a global employee survey,
                                    hitachi insights, to assess employee engagement. in fiscal 2015, we broadened the range
                                    of sharing of survey results to include managers. by helping managers apply these results
                                    toward concrete actions, we are improving engagement across the group.
                                            in may 2013, we adopted the hitachi group human rights policy to supplement
                                    the hitachi group codes of conduct, drawn up in fiscal 2010. these serve as the base

corporate governance


                                 hitachi’s approach

                                in many overseas markets, there are recognized corporate governance
                                codes that have been established to prevent corporate corruption and
                                protect the rights of shareholders. the japanese government applied a
                                corporate governance code to all companies listed on the tokyo stock
                                exchange in june 2015 with the aim of bolstering sustained growth and
                                improving corporate value over the medium and long terms.
                                     hitachi is pursuing corporate governance as a vital aspect of
                                business operations, with the goal of bolstering value, realizing
                                transparent and efficient management, and establishing a relationship of
                                trust that meets stakeholder expectations. hitachi, ltd. and its eight
                                major listed subsidiaries have adopted the committee system to realize a
                                highly transparent governance system. through our j-sox committee
                                and other efforts, we maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of our
                                internal control over financial reporting.


                                  our actions in fiscal 2014
                                  hitachi is working to implement a group-wide system of governance covering each
                                  aspect of its global operations. as part of these efforts we reorganized the hitachi
                                  group into six areas of focus with the goal of boosting overall governance. we are also
                                  working to transition to an “autonomous decentralized global management” structure
                                  in which each region leads its business autonomously to accelerate proper decision
                                  making and effectively use management resources.


                                    combined the power system group and the infrastructure system group under a
                                    new management structure to form the power and infrastructure systems group.
                                    began implementing a shift to an “autonomous decentralized global management”
                                    structure by appointing group representatives in the four global regions of the
                                    americas, china, asia-pacific, and emea/cis.



policies and frameworks          driving hitachi’s governance

                                hitachi, ltd. has adopted the committee system, which has nominating, audit, and
                                compensation committees.*1 we aim to establish a framework for quick business
                                operations and to realize highly transparent management by separating the responsibilities
                                for management oversight from the execution of business operations. the majority of our
                                board of directors are outside directors, including non-japanese. our goals are to reflect
                                diverse and global viewpoints as well as to reinforce management supervisory functions.
                                we have formulated and published corporate governance guidelines outlining the
                                framework of corporate governance, such as the function and composition of the board of

     corporate governance
                                directors, qualifications for outside directors, and the criteria for assessing the
                guidelines      independence of outside directors.

                                *1 a corporate governance system under the companies act of japan, where a board of directors makes basic policy
                                   decisions and oversees the execution of business by executive officers, while the executive officers, appointed by
                                   the board of directors, execute the company’s business affairs via a set of statutory committees. hitachi, ltd. and
                                   its eight major listed subsidiaries have adopted this system.

                                             we reorganized the hitachi group into six areas of focus under our market-driven
                                             management, with the goal of speeding up services centered on our social innovation
                                             business and strengthening competitiveness in global markets related to social
                                             infrastructure. this move was designed for a rapid response to the worldwide dynamic
                                             changes in business models and services and to enable the entire hitachi group to
                                             present solutions to social issues as well as those faced by our customers.


                                             six-group management structure
                                             in april 2012, we reorganized our existing group management system into five groups: the
                                             information and information & telecommunication systems group, the infrastructure
                                             systems group, the power systems group, the construction machinery group, and the
                                             high functional materials and components group. following this, we established the
                                             automotive systems group in april 2013 and then the healthcare group in april 2014. we
                                             established our current six-group management system in april 2015 by merging the power
                                             systems group and infrastructure systems group into the power and infrastructure
                                             systems group. our six-group management structure enables us to integrate closely
                                             related business, providing maximum value to our customers by allowing for faster
                                             decision making, optimization of group business portfolios, and enhanced global
                                             competitiveness. we will continue to introduce initiatives that strengthen our social

                             to accelerate growth in the global market, hitachi in april 2015 appointed chief
                             executives who represent the hitachi group in interactions with regional communities
                             and customers in the four global regions of the americas, china, the asia-pacific, and

                             and effectively utilizing management resources, the chief executives have authority to
                             make investments in new business areas where growth is expected and are
                             accountable for the returns or losses on these investments. the system implements a
                             transition to an autonomous decentralized global management structure in which each
                             region leads its business independently.

policies and frameworks           compensation for directors and executive officers

                                 compensation for every director and executive officer is determined by the compensation
                                 committee based on the provisions of the companies act of japan.
                                          compensation for directors and executive officers consists of monthly salaries together
                                 with year-end allowances for directors and a performance-linked component for executive
                                 officers. while compensation for directors is basically fixed, the performance-linked
                                 component for executive officers is set within a range equivalent to about 40% of the
                                 executive officer’s annual income, adjusted based on company and individual performance.
                                 beginning with compensation for fiscal 2008, the system for directors and executive officers
                                 was revised to abolish retirement allowances. the payment of retirement allowances to
                                 directors and executive officers due to the abolition of the retirement allowance system will
                                 be in an amount determined by the compensation committee at the time of the retirement
                                 of those directors or executive officers. the amount of compensation for directors and
                                 executive officers in fiscal 2014 is shown below.

risk management


                               hitachi’s approach

                              risks that may threaten business operations can be categorized into
                              “hazard risks” (natural disasters, war and terror, crimes, etc.),
                              “operational risks” (illegal conduct and corruption, quality problems, etc.),
                              “financial risks,” and “strategic risks.”
                                   hitachi strives to identify various risks and to evaluate vulnerability in
                              order to prevent disruption and minimize damage these risks may cause
                              to its business operations.
                                   our business is deeply concerned with developing and maintaining
                              social infrastructure in each and every part of the world. therefore, we
                              commit to making the best effort to strengthen our risk management and
                              enhance our business continuity plans (bcps) to mitigate disruptions of
                              and damage to business that may severely affect social infrastructure.


                                our actions in fiscal 2014
                                a comprehensive risk management system was implemented across the entire
                                hitachi group. bcps were developed and enhanced in key operations in japan and
                                overseas as well. research and risk analysis are undertaken and risk information and
                                alerts are distributed to secure the safety of employees who work in high-risk areas of
                                war and terror.


                                  risk officers are assigned in about 200 business operations of in-house companies
                                  and group companies. about 300 group companies implemented and enhanced
                                  their bcps.
                                  research and survey missions were sent to several countries in the middle east and
                                  africa. timely travel alerts and warnings were distributed promptly to all business
                                  operations around the world.



policies and frameworks        reinforcement of risk management system

                              the entire hitachi group is reinforcing its risk management system to address
                              increasingly globalized and complex risks.
                                      under hitachi, ltd.’s head of risk management, each business operation assigns an
                              executive as its risk management officer to manage risks mainly concerned with
                              compliance, export control, disasters, and crime, and to respond adequately in
                              coordination among the entire group. furthermore, hitachi has started to build a
                              comprehensive risk management system that contains standards and procedures for
                              evaluating any risks that may affect business.

           key approaches                  creating bcps in key operations worldwide

                                          given the close relation of our business to social infrastructure, we are enhancing our
                                          bcps to ensure that the impact of risks does not disrupt our business and thereby
                                          significantly affect society. in december 2006, we issued the hitachi group guidelines for
                                          developing business continuity plans in japanese. in fiscal 2010 these were translated
                                          into english and chinese for distribution to all hitachi group companies worldwide to

(department version).                             when the great east japan earthquake struck in march 2011, our bcps enabled
                                          quick responses and swift decision making. however, issues emerged including
                                          identification of secondary and other suppliers, cloud storage and multiplexing of
                                          production information, and the need to secure alternate transportation and fuel sources.
                                                  based on the lessons learned from this disaster, in october 2011 we released and
                                          distributed new bcp guidelines for departmental implementation to further improve our
                                          bcps. hitachi group operations in japan completed their preparation and review of bcps,
                                          based on applicability to their operations, by the end of fiscal 2011. bcps for large

           key approaches                  improving safety for employees sent to dangerous regions

                                          responding to the hostage incident in algeria in january 2013, president hiroaki nakanishi
                                          reinforced his policy in february 2013 of ensuring the safety of employees sent outside
                                          japan. survey missions of in-house and outside experts are now sent beforehand to areas
                                          at high risk of war, terrorism, and other threats. even after employees are dispatched to
                                          such areas, we conduct additional local surveys every six months as a means of confirming
                                          the effectiveness of our safety policies. in fiscal 2014, survey missions were sent to several
                                          countries in africa and the middle east. in addition, we have introduced a range of safety
                                          measures in the light of recent terrorist incidents involving japanese and other nationals,
                                          including providing timely alerts to employees. these and other steps underscore our
                                          commitment to ensuring the safety of our employees working around the globe.
                                                  hitachi is also contributing to safety measures at other japanese corporations
                                          operating outside japan. to help enhance collaboration between the private and
                                          public sectors in this area, hitachi executives participated in the council for public-
                                          private cooperation for overseas safety organized by japan’s ministry of foreign
                                          affairs, and in june 2014 hitachi took part in a public-private kidnap incident
                                          preparatory training exercise.

compliance


                               hitachi’s approach

                              as a global company, upholding the laws and regulations of the countries
                              and regions where we do business is a basic premise of our operations.
                              we have enhanced our compliance framework by appointing an executive
                              officer to oversee the implementation of risk management initiatives
                              group-wide and by putting top executives at key group companies in
                              charge of handling risk management.
                                   we also promote sincere and fair business practices by bolstering
                              measures against bribery and other corrupt practices, upholding fair
                              competition laws, pursuing greater information security, and
                              deepening compliance knowledge and awareness among hitachi
                              group companies worldwide.


                                our actions in fiscal 2014
                                we are strengthening compliance and information security initiatives, such as holding
                                the compliance management conference and the hitachi group compliance
                                conference as well as establishing the advisory committee and the information
                                security promotion council. we also hold group-wide education and training sessions
                                to build employee awareness of the hitachi group codes of conduct, fair competition
                                laws, export control policies, and information security.


                                  over 250,000 copies of the hitachi group codes of conduct handbook distributed
                                  to employees at group companies in japan (as of march 2015).
                                  group education sessions on the japanese antimonopoly law held for all hitachi,
                                  ltd. sales managers.
                                  e-learning programs on export control basics and us re-export controls introduced and
                                  taken by around 22,000 employees at 106 group companies worldwide.
                                  e-learning programs held on information security and personal information protection;
                                  information security and personal information protection audits conducted at all
                                  group companies and business units.




                             implementing our compliance framework


           frameworks          enhancing our compliance framework

                              to comprehensively implement our compliance framework, we have appointed a senior
                              executive as the head of risk management for the entire hitachi group. every in-house
                              company and key group company also has an executive handling risk management,
                              assisted by a compliance manager (cm).
                                      under this system, policies and measures are shared through the compliance
                              management conference, composed of risk management executives from in-house
                              companies and key group companies. in addition, all cms meet regularly at the hitachi
                              group compliance conference to provide information on compliance and to confirm
                              implementation of required actions.

                                      the advisory committee, consisting of outside experts, convenes regularly to
                              exchange views on the state of compliance initiatives. the insights provided by
                              committee members are utilized to improve policies and actions.
                                      the internal audit section regularly conducts group-wide reviews to verify that each
                              area of compliance is being appropriately operated. in cases where the reviews identify
                              necessary improvements, corrective measures are swiftly implemented.


           core policy         ensuring awareness of the hitachi group codes of conduct

                              hitachi, ltd. formulated the hitachi group codes of conduct as a common conduct
                              code for the hitachi group in fiscal 2010. we issued the hitachi group codes of
                              conduct handbook in fiscal 2011 as a guidebook for all employees; as of march 2015,
                              more than 250,000 copies have been distributed to employees in japan. we ask
                              managers to submit a written pledge to comply with the hitachi group codes of
                              conduct. to deepen awareness of the codes throughout our global operations, we have
                              produced english and chinese versions of a japanese-language e-learning tool
                              showing appropriate behavior and presenting specific examples for use in hitachi group

           hitachi group
                              companies within and outside japan. we also conduct compliance training that
        codes of conduct      includes group companies outside japan.


       key approaches          compliance reporting system

                              hitachi has instituted a group-wide whistleblowing system to prevent illegal and
                              unethical behavior, to promptly address infractions, and to enhance our ability to
                              self-regulate.
                                      in this system, reports go directly to the compliance department at hitachi or to an
                              outside attorney. this system can be used not only by hitachi employees but also by
                              former employees, temporary staff, and suppliers. in addition, we have implemented the
                              channel to the board of directors system to allow employees to directly report problems
                              anonymously to hitachi directors. the facts related to all reports are subject to thorough
                              investigation and checking, and people who have identified themselves in the reports are
                              informed of the investigation results. we make every effort to appropriately deal with
                              situations, including taking remedial action where necessary.


       key approaches          preventing bribery and corrupt practices

                              to deal with global bribery and corruption risks, in fiscal 2013 we referred to the us
                              foreign corrupt practices act resource guide*1 and other documents to develop various
                              corruption risk scenarios. these were used as the basis for a survey conducted at hitachi
                              group companies outside japan. by analyzing the survey results, we identified several
                              companies at risk from corruption. we are monitoring and working with those companies
                              with the goal of reducing corruption worldwide.

                              *1 the us foreign corrupt practices act consists of antibribery provisions regarding foreign government officials and
                                 transparent accounting provisions within the securities exchange act. enforced by the department of justice, it
                                 prohibits bribes to foreign government officials. transparent accounting, enforced by the securities and exchange
                                 commission, requires companies to show transactions fairly and accurately in their accounting records and to
                                 maintain effective internal control over accounting.

       key approaches         preventing violations of fair competition laws

                             hitachi engages in business based on the principles of conformance with the law and
                             business ethics and fair and disciplined competition. however, hitachi, ltd. was found
                             to have impaired the fairness of a public bid in fiscal 2002 and was penalized in
                             september 2006, october 2008, and march 2009 for violating the japanese
                             antimonopoly law.
                                     in november 2012, a subsidiary dealing in automotive components was penalized
                             by the japan fair trade commission for violating the antimonopoly law. in
                             september 2013, the same company was prosecuted by the us department of
                             justice for violating american antitrust laws, resulting in a plea bargain.
                                     we are working to prevent further violations and to broaden awareness of
                             compliance issues, including publicizing messages from top executives, developing
                             company regulations, conducting regular audits, and providing education and
                             training to employees based on a compliance manual. in fiscal 2014, we held group
                             education sessions on the antimonopoly law for all hitachi sales managers, with
                             957 taking part.
                                     through these initiatives we will continue working to improve and enhance our
                             compliance framework.


       key approaches         prevention of antisocial transactions

                             to cut off all relationships with organized crime groups and other antisocial forces, we
                             observe the following three provisions laid out in the hitachi group codes of conduct:
                             1. we will have no relations whatsoever with antisocial forces such as organized
                                crime groups, and we will never engage in antisocial transactions under any
                                circumstances.
                             2. we will prevent antisocial transactions through self-inspection of our transactions.
                             3. we will oppose antisocial forces such as organized crime groups with firm resolve,
                                and refuse any improper demands.
                                     the entire hitachi group acts decisively to eliminate approaches from antisocial
                             forces in partnership with, where necessary, the police, external specialist institutions
                             (the national center for the elimination of boryokudan and tokuboren, the federation
                             on special organized crimes within jurisdiction of the metropolitan police
                             department), and lawyers. we include an organized crime elimination clause in
                             contracts so that if it is determined that a business partner belongs to an antisocial
                             group, we can void the contract and break off the relationship.

       key approaches            thorough export controls

                                for basic export control policies, we adopt the hitachi standards of corporate
                                conduct,*1 which state: “we shall help maintain international peace and security through
                                compliance with trade-related laws and regulations.” we established the corporate
                                regulations concerning security export control based on this policy in 1987. we carry
                                out strict export control practices according to laws and regulations, screening all goods
                                and technologies intended for export for such factors as destination countries and
                                regions as well as intended end use and end users. we provide guidance and educational
                                support to hitachi group companies to ensure that all group companies follow the same
                                export control policies. in fiscal 2014, we held workshops for group companies in the
                                united states, europe, and china and other asian countries providing practical training on
                                export control. e-learning programs on export control basics and us re-export controls were
                                introduced and taken by around 22,000 employees at 106 group companies worldwide.

                                *1 hitachi standards of corporate conduct: created by hitachi, ltd. to ensure full awareness of hitachi’s mission and
                                   role and to enable hitachi to continue to grow as a truly global enterprise.




                              promoting information security


policies and frameworks          implementing rigorous information security

                                the information security committee, chaired by the chief information security officer,
                                determines our information security policies and procedures. the information security
                                promotion council and other bodies convey decisions internally and to other companies in
                                the hitachi group. information security officers at business sites and companies ensure
                                that these decisions are implemented in the workplace.
                                        the hitachi group emphasizes two points in information security and personal
                                information protection:


                                   1    precautionary measures and prompt security responses
                                  we classify assets to be secured and take safeguarding measures based on
                                  vulnerability and risk analyses. we also have an emergency manual for security
                                  breaches, based on the assumption that these are inevitable, and not just possible.


                                   2    promoting stronger ethical and security awareness among data users
                                  we have prepared a program tailored to hitachi’s various personnel levels and are
                                  working to raise the prevailing sense of ethics and security awareness through
                                  group-wide e-learning. we are also conducting audits to identify and address
                                  problems early on.

policies and frameworks        protecting personal information

                              we established a personal information protection management system based on our
                              personal information protection policy. through the rollout of this system, as well as the

   personal information
                              safe handling of personal information, e-learning programs for all employees, and periodic
      protection policy       audits, we are ensuring protection of personal information throughout the company.

                              hitachi, ltd. first received privacy mark certification in march 2007. we have maintained
                              the high level of privacy protection needed to renew this certification five subsequent
                              times, most recently in march 2015. the entire hitachi group is committed to personal
                              information protection, with 61 hitachi group companies in japan having received the
                              privacy mark as of may 2015. in july 2009, the corporate hospital group in japan also
                              gained privacy mark certification. this group is working hard to protect and carefully
                              handle the personal information of its patients and others. hitachi also strives to safeguard

policies and frameworks        preventing information leaks

                              hitachi, ltd. has formulated the three principles for preventing leakage of confidential
                              information to ensure the highest level of care for such information and to prevent leaks
                              and other incidents involving it. our policies ensure that if an incident does occur, damage
                              is promptly minimized by contacting customers, reporting to government agencies,
                              investigating causes, and acting to prevent any recurrence.
                                      hitachi group companies take the following it steps to prevent information leaks:
                              using encryption software and secure pcs; employing electronic document access control
                              and expiration processing software; maintaining id management and access control by
                              building an authentication infrastructure; and filtering e-mail and visited websites. in
                              response to the recent spate of targeted e-mail attacks and other cyber attacks, we are
                              participating in an initiative to share information between the private sector and the
                              government. we are also enhancing our it organization by adding more layers to our leak
                              prevention procedures, including both entry and exit countermeasures.
                                      to ensure the secure exchange of information with our suppliers, we review their
                              information security measures based on hitachi’s own standards before allowing them
                              access to confidential information. we have provided tools to suppliers (procurement
                              partners) for security education and for checking business information on computers. in
                              addition, we require suppliers to check and remove business information from personal
                              computers to prevent leaks.


                                three principles for preventing leakage of confidential information
                                 principle 1   as a general principle nobody can take confidential information out of the
                                               company’s premises.
                                 principle 2   any person taking confidential information out of the company’s premises
                                               due to business necessity shall obtain prior approval from the information
                                               assets manager.
                                 principle 3   any person taking confidential information out of the company’s premises
                                               due to business necessity shall put in place relevant and appropriate
                                               measures against information leakage.


       key approaches          global information security management

                              hitachi group companies worldwide reinforce their information security in line with our
                              global information security administration rules, which conform to the international iso/
                              iec 27001 standard. these rules are distributed from the parent company in japan to
                              group companies around the world. other security measures include secure shared
                              services and support from our regional headquarters in the americas, europe, southeast
                              asia, china, and india.

       key approaches         education on information security

                             consistently maintaining information security requires all parties to continually develop their
                             knowledge of information handling and to remain strongly aware of the issues. for this
                             reason, we hold annual e-learning programs on information security and personal
                             information protection for all directors, employees, and temporary employees.
                                     nearly all of the roughly 40,000 employees at hitachi, ltd. participate in these
                             programs. we provide specific additional training, with clear goals, that is geared to new
                             employees and managers, and to information system administrators in particular. in 2012,
                             we also began simulation training to educate employees about the increasing trend toward
                             targeted e-mail attacks and other cyberattacks. employees are sent examples of targeted
                             e-mail to heighten their awareness of security through direct experience.
                                     our educational programs, available to hitachi group companies in japan and
                             overseas, provide group-wide education on information security and personal
                             information protection.


       key approaches         thorough information security audits and inspections

                             the hitachi group has developed its approach to security based on the “plan-do-check-
                             act” (pdca) cycle for its information security management system. we conduct annual
                             information security and personal information protection audits at all group companies and
                             business units.
                                     the president appoints officers to conduct independent audits. these officers are
                             not allowed to audit their own units, underlining our commitment to fairness and
                             objectivity in auditing. hitachi group companies in japan conduct audits in the same

                              campaign for corporate ethics and compliance month

                             corporate ethics and compliance are the bedrock of all our activities. to cultivate and
                             enhance awareness of corporate ethics we have since fiscal 2009 designated october as
                             ethics and compliance month throughout the hitachi group.
                                     the ceo of hitachi, ltd. shares messages with employees during this period,
                             which serves as an important opportunity to reexamine the importance of corporate
                             ethics. we have also created and put up on our intranet a set of case studies for
                             workplace discussions on issues relevant to particular workplaces. all of these case
                             studies match chapters in the hitachi group codes of conduct handbook and have
                             been translated into english and chinese for use in our global operations. in addition,
                             company-based activities such as lectures, presentations of satirical senryu poems, and
                             the display of themed posters are being used to instill and foster awareness of
                             corporate ethics among employees.
