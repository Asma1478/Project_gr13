           hazira, in north-west india, is one of
           the country’s major industrial hubs and
           biggest ports. heavy industry such as
           manufacturing companies, steelmakers
           and power plants have set up business
           there. but rapid development in recent
           years has affected the environment. for
           example, the wide tidal mudflats along

           as part of efforts to rejuvenate the local
           environment we have been working
           with village communities, the regional

        enhanced oil recovery
        it is estimated that on average only about
        a third of a reservoir’s oil is normally
        recovered. but by using enhanced oil
        recovery (eor) techniques, we can extract
        more from existing resources, extending
        the life of declining fields. the international
        energy agency estimates that 300 billion
        barrels of oil could be unlocked globally by
        using techniques such as injecting steam,
        gas or chemicals to recover more oil from
        the ground. shell has been at the forefront
        of eor development since the 1930s,
        when we first applied steam recovery in
        california. in texas in the 1970s we were
        also one of the first companies to inject co2
        to enhance oil recovery.

        we conducted successful field trials in
        syria with an eor technique that involves
        injecting low-salt water to alter the rock’s
        properties, including its permeability. oil
        recovery has increased 14% since these                                                                 restoring oyster beds in the gulf of mexico.

          securing diverse energy




        oil sands
        canada’s oil sands are one of the world’s
        largest potential sources of crude oil.
        if developed responsibly they can make
        an increasing contribution to meeting the
        world’s energy needs. but developing
        and processing oil sands is energy and
        water intensive.

        at our oil sands operations we are tackling
        these challenges by finding ways to
        improve our energy efficiency and limit
        fresh-water use through recycling. we
        are also working to develop a large-scale
        carbon capture and storage (ccs) project.
        we work with neighbouring communities,
        supporting local and aboriginal businesses.
        by the end of 2010, we had contracted

        companies since 2005. we also work

        the arctic
        the arctic could be essential to meeting
        growing demand for energy in the future.
        it holds as much as 30% of the world’s
        undiscovered natural gas and around 13%
        of its yet-to-find oil, according to the u.s.
        geological survey. of these resources,
        about 84% lie offshore. we have plans to
        explore in the beaufort and chukchi seas
        off north alaska in the near future.

        the arctic’s environment is already
        undergoing change due to global warming.
        it is home to indigenous peoples who
        depend on the land and sea for their

           in 2002, shell foundation and the world resources institute created embarq, a                    using cleaner-burning cookstoves in india.
           global network of transport experts that creates sustainable ways to overcome local
           transport problems. these include bus rapid transit (brt) systems, retrofitting existing
           buses with environmental improvements, and developing cycling and pedestrian
           routes as well as transport safety measures. in mexico city, for example, a 20 km brt
           corridor – the network’s first initiative – now serves 500,000 passengers a day, halving
           previous travel times for its passengers. embarq has expanded its operations to run
           projects in 22 cities around the world and has attracted $880 million in investment.
           more than one billion passengers have benefitted and it is estimated that the scheme
           has saved 720,000 tonnes of co2.

           in 2010 shell foundation released a new report, enterprise solutions to scale, to
           highlight lessons learned from successes and failures. the report aims to encourage
           transparency among organisations engaged in similar work so that lessons may be
           shared more effectively.

        fuel efficiency
        road transport emits 17% of the world’s
        co2 emissions from fossil fuels. with the
        number of cars and trucks on the road
        expected to reach well over 2 billion
        by 2050, limiting co2 emissions from
        transport will be a major challenge.

        [a]	petroleum industry guidelines for greenhouse gas estimate, december 2003 (api, ipieca, ogp), indicate that uncertainty in greenhouse gas measurements can be
             significant depending on the methods used. co2 equivalent is a term used to express the total emissions of the major greenhouse gases, including co2, methane,
             nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons. in 1998 we set a voluntary target for 2010 of 5% lower direct ghg emissions from facilities we operate than our comparable
             1990 level. direct ghg emissions for the 1990 base year for our major facilities have been adjusted in accordance with the requirements of iso 14064‑1. it has not
             been technically feasible to determine the 1990 emissions for some recent acquisitions. we have updated our 2009 figures following recalculation of the data.
        [b]	the rise in flaring emissions in 2010 is primarily due to increased production in nigeria, as well as inclusion of flaring in iraq following the start of our production
             contract with the iraqi government in 2010. flaring in iraq amounted to 0.3 million tonnes of hydrocarbon in 2010. we have updated our 2009 figures following
             recalculation of the data.
        [c]	data reported in accordance with ipieca guidelines. we have updated our 2008 and 2009 figures following recalculation of the data.
        [d]	we have updated the last five years of data to reflect the operation of cogeneration facilities. the data includes mining and upgrading operations. it does not include
             in situ production.
        [e]	we have indexed our refinery energy intensity data to the year 2002. this allows for easier comparison of current performance to our starting point. the index is
             based upon the solomon associates energy intensity index 2006 methodology.
        [f] all spill volumes and numbers are for spills over 100 kilograms.
        [g] we have updated our 2009 figures following completion of investigations to confirm spill volumes.
        [h] all sabotage and theft related spills have occurred in nigeria except in 2007 (0.7 thousand tonnes outside nigeria) and 2006 (0.6 thousand tonnes outside nigeria).
        [i]	we have updated our 2009 figure following review of the data. the number of operational spills reported for the years 2004 and 2005 also contain a small number
             of hurricane spills.
        [j] we have updated our 2007 figure following review of our data and portfolio.
