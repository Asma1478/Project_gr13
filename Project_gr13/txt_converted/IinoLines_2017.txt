            holidays via the central monitoring unit makes it possible to rapidly respond to any situation, and ibt is utilizing this capability to
            develop a mechanism for preventing problems and minimizing their impact in the unlikely event that something occurs.

        accidents in fiscal year 2016, 90% or more of the accidents
        and problems occured on group owned vessels were caused
        by human error on the part of crew members.
        to eradicate human error, it is important to include case

      iino kaiun kaisha, ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries

      notes to consolidated financial statements


      1. basis of presentation of the consolidated financial statements
      the accompanying consolidated financial statements of iino kaiun kaisha, ltd. (the “company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries
      (collectively, the “companies”) are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in japan. the accompanying
      consolidated financial statements are prepared by the company as required under the financial instrument exchange law of japan.

      certain items presented in the consolidated financial statements submitted to the director of the kanto finance bureau in japan have
      been reclassified for the convenience of readers outside of japan.




      2. summary of significant accounting policies
      a. basis of consolidation

      the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its 56 significant subsidiaries in 2017 (54 in 2016).

      the other subsidiaries are excluded from consolidation since, in aggregate, the combined total assets, net sales, net income, and retained
      earnings of these subsidiaries do not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the companies.

      for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, all significant intercompany transactions, account balances, and
      unrealized profits among the companies have been eliminated.

      b. equity method

      investments in significant affiliates are accounted for under the equity method as of march 31, 2017 and 2016.

      investments in the remaining 7 non-consolidated subsidiaries and 3 affiliates of the company are stated at cost on march 31, 2017 (7
      non-consolidated subsidiaries and 3 affiliates on march 31, 2016) since the company’s equity in their net income (loss), on aggregate, does
      not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

      c. fiscal periods of consolidated subsidiaries

      the accounts of the consolidated subsidiaries, except for serpent’s mouth carriers s. a. and 5 other subsidiaries whose fiscal year ends are
      december 31, are prepared as of the same date as the consolidated financial statements. the aforementioned 6 subsidiaries with differing
      financial years are included in the consolidated financial statements based on their accounts as of december 31 (their fiscal year ends), and
      necessary adjustments for significant transactions during the period between their fiscal year ends and the consolidated balance sheet
      date are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

      d. foreign currency translation

      all monetary assets and liabilities of the company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are
      translated into japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet dates. the foreign exchange gains and losses from
      translation are recognized in the statements of income to the extent that they are not hedged by forward exchange contracts. revenues
      and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates of the respective periods.

      e. vessel operating revenues and related costs

      vessel operating revenues and related costs are recognised using the percentage-of-completion method, according to the number of days
      the vessel has completed its voyage.

      f. income taxes

      the provision for income taxes is computed based on “income before corporate income taxes” in the consolidated statements of
      operations. the asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
      consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded for tax purposes.




63   iino report 2017

g. net income and dividends per share

net income per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
year, appropriately adjusted for stock splits during the year.

cash dividends per common share shown for each year in the accompanying statements of operations represent dividends approved as
applicable to the respective year.

net income is adjusted by deducting bonuses paid to directors as well as the payment of dividends to shareholders of preferred stocks to
be recognized as an appropriation of retained earnings, and the calculation of net income per share is made on that adjusted net income
basis.

h. cash and cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows are comprised of cash in hand, bank deposits able to be withdrawn
on demand, and marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less and which represent a minor risk of fluctuation in
value.

i. marketable securities and investment securities

equity securities classified as “other securities” (available-for-sale securities) for which market quotations are available, are stated at fair
market value. net unrealized gains or losses on these securities are reported as a separate item in other comprehensive income at a
net-of-tax amount and carried as accumulated other comprehensive income. equity and debt securities classified as “other securities
(available-for-sale-securities) for which market quotations are not available, are stated at amortized cost or acquisition cost calculated using
the weighted average method.

j. derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

in accordance with the “accounting standard for financial instruments” and the “guidelines for accounting for financial instruments,”
gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements, forward exchange contracts and currency swap
contracts designated as “hedging instruments” are reported as a separate item in other comprehensive income and carried as
accumulated other comprehensive income until the profits and losses on the hedged items or transactions are recognized.

in addition, net cash flows from interest rate swap agreements which meet certain criteria under the accounting standard, are offset
against or added to the interest arising from the hedged interest-bearing debt.

in addition, designation (“furiate-shori”) is applied to forward exchange contracts and currency swap contracts designated as hedging
instruments under certain criteria.

derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to market, and the unrealized gains or losses on the derivative
instruments are charged or credited to current earnings.

k. allowance for doubtful accounts

an allowance for doubtful accounts is generally provided at an amount calculated using the bad debt loss ratio, primarily based on past
experience, plus the estimated uncollectible amount of specific receivables.

l. inventories

real estates held for sale are stated at cost, determined using the specific cost method and the real estate held for sale with lower
profitability are written down for the purpose of reporting on the balance sheet. other inventories are stated at cost, determined using the
first-in first-out method and other inventories with lower profitability are written down for the purpose of reporting on the balance sheet.




                                                                                                                         iino report 2017          64

      m. depreciation and amortization

      tangible fixed assets (excluding lease assets):
      vessels, property and equipment, including significant capital expenditures and additions, are stated at cost. maintenance and repairs are
      charged to income as incurred.

      depreciation is computed using the straight-line method (or the fixed ratio method for some vessels) over the estimated useful lives of the
      assets as designated by the japanese income tax laws.

      intangible fixed assets (excluding lease assets):
      amortization of intangible assets is primarily computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as
      designated by the japanese income tax laws. software for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the period of
      estimated use (5 years).

      lease assets:
      finance lease transactions that transfer the ownership are capitalized and accounted for as ordinary sales transactions.
      finance lease transactions that do not transfer the ownership are capitalized and depreciated by using the straight-line method over the
      lease term of the assets with no residual value.
      finance lease transactions that do not transfer the ownership, which commenced prior to april 1, 2008, are accounted for as ordinary lease
      transactions.

      n. accrued employees’ pension and severance costs

      accrued employees’ pension and severance costs under the defined benefit plans of the companies are determined based on the required
      payment for personal circumstances of projected benefit obligations at year end, calculated by applying the simplified method to
      employee service rendered to that date, and the actuarial value of plan assets at year end.

      o. reserve for periodic overhaul of vessels

      under japanese law, the vessels of the companies are subject to periodic overhaul. japanese law requires that vessels be overhauled every
      five years. the companies provide for the estimated cost of the future periodic overhaul of vessels.

      p. appropriation of retained earnings

      the corporation law of japan provides that an amount equal to 10% of distribution of surplus (aggregate of capital surplus and retained
      earnings) must be appropriated as a legal reserve or as capital reserve depending on which surplus is distributed, until the total of such
      reserve and additional capital reserve equals 25% of capital.

      6. derivative financial instruments

      in the normal course of business, the companies employ forward exchange contracts to manage their exposure to adverse fluctuations in
      foreign exchange rates in respect of receivables and payables. in addition, the companies use interest rate swap agreements to limit their
