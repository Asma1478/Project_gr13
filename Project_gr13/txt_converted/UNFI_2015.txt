                      a letter from the ceo
                      today, our industry is in a time of rapid change, offering many exciting

                      possibilities. at the same time, the world is undergoing demographic,

                      environmental and cultural shifts that affect us all.

                      as a company whose mission is to provide healthier food options to

                      people and their families, we believe that being a good neighbor is our

                      responsibility – especially as we innovate and grow to capture new

                      opportunities. we stay true to the values that we’ve operated by for 40 years

                      and we’ll continue to do so for another 40. that’s what sets unfi apart.

                      this year, we evolved the unfi brand. it’s a change that marks the start of

                      our next chapter, best conveyed by our tagline “discover what’s next.” it

                      communicates how we approach our work every day – with bold ideas and

                      new possibilities that drive our future. you’ll see many examples of this

steven spinner, ceo   in our csr report this year, from the thousands of hours our associates

                      volunteer in their communities to the millions of kilowatt hours of

                      renewable energy produced by our solar arrays.

                      i’m inspired to come to unfi every day and partner with associates who are

                      so tremendously dedicated to giving back. they truly drive our success.



                                                      sincerely,


                                                                                                      promoting healthy, organic food systems
