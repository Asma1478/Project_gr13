 global industry overview
 global wine production and consumption
 the fundamentals of the global wine industry remain attractive. consistent with trends observed in f15, the
 long-term global demand and supply continues to move into balance (as shown in figure 3 below). global wine
 production in 2015 was supported by strong vintages in three of the world’s largest wine producing nations: italy,
 france and spain. this was partially offset by lower yielding vintages in argentina, south africa and china.

1. every year, due to timing requirements of reporting and billing latency from third party suppliers, the majority of the june environmental
   performance data for energy, water, waste and carbon emissions is estimated. prior to annual publication, the june figures of the previous
   year are replaced with actual values. similarly, any other discrepancies in the previous year’s data are amended.
2. absolute figures include all wineries, packaging centres and company-owned vineyards. they do not include data from offices or cellar doors.
3. energy and water efficiency for twe’s wineries and packaging centres include non-twe australian volumes packaged at our facilities
   under contract. efficiencies do not include energy and water used at company-owned vineyards, offices, and cellar doors.
4. includes all wineries, packaging centres and company-owned vineyards. does not include emissions from offices, cellar doors, wastewater
   treatment plants, refrigerants or scope 3 emissions.
5. this data reports on environmental indicators from the sites acquired by twe from diageo on 1 january 2016.
6. lost time injury frequency rate (ltifr).
7. the company’s f15 annual report reported a volunteering participation rate of 58.6% based on the proportion of salaried employees
   who accessed volunteering leave during that financial year. reporting of the volunteering participation rate has changed in f16 to include
   salaried and non-salaried employees. this has resulted in a change to the rate previously reported for f15.

as outlined in the company’s f15 annual report, twe has seen energy and emissions improvements as it
optimises the company’s supply chain, moving production to more efficient sites and improving facility utilisation.
these improvements occurred in the company’s primary production regions of the us and australia.
the company expects that energy, water and emissions will improve as a result of further optimisation to the
supply chain footprint due to be embedded in f17.
total solid waste generated has also reduced over time due to a number of reasons, including an ongoing
continuous improvement program, sustainability projects and supply chain optimisation. this has occurred
alongside increases to the company’s solid waste to recycling ratios.
while twe has seen waste and energy efficiency improvements in f16, a number of environmental metrics
are difficult for the company to control given the nature of grape growing and influence of climatic conditions.
changes in production volumes and highly variable growing conditions year to year impact the company’s
overall efficiency.
during f16, twe acquired diageo’s wine business, taking effect from 1 january 2016. as the us vintage took
place prior to twe taking control of these sites, the environmental metrics attributable to the acquired assets
have not been included in twe’s f16 data, and have instead been reported separately. efficiency data for these
assets is not available for f16, as production occurred prior to 1 january 2016. from f17 onwards, these sites
will be reported in the same form as all other twe sites.
in f16, twe undertook its second global volunteering week. due to the acquisition of the diageo wine business,
twe’s employee base increased in the months leading up to the week. as a result, while on a like-for-like
basis total participant numbers for global volunteering week 2016 was very similar to 2015, the proportion
of employees who participated reduced slightly.

                     financial, strategic and operational hurdles and agreed key performance
                     objectives (kpos) are achieved.
                     one-third of the stip award for executives is deferred into restricted equity
                     in the company. of this restricted equity, one-half (i.e. one-sixth of the overall
                     stip award) will vest after one year, and one half (i.e. one-sixth of the overall
                     stip award) will vest after two years.
                     the remaining two-thirds of the stip award is delivered in cash at the end
                     of the one-year performance period.
long-term            the ltip is an at-risk component of executive remuneration under which an            section 4.c
incentive            equity reward may be provided to participants based on achievement of specific
plan (ltip)          performance measures over a three-year performance period.
                     under the ltip, participants are awarded performance rights which give them
                     the opportunity to acquire shares subject to two performance measures with
                     equal weighting:
                     • relative total shareholder return (tsr); and
                     • return on capital employed (roce) growth.
share cellar         the group operates a broad-based employee share plan, share cellar,                  section 4.d
                     which operates by way of after-tax employee payroll contributions (minimum
                     $500 to maximum $3,000) to acquire twe shares. for every two purchased
                     shares that a participant holds at the vesting date (approximately two years)
                     twe delivers one matched share.
                     shares were acquired in f16 under the 2015 share cellar offer, and a subsequent
                     offer to participate in the 2016 share cellar plan was made during the year.
restricted equity    in addition to the ltip, the group operates the rep which allows the board           section 4.e.3
plan (rep)           to make offers of restricted shares or deferred share rights for the purpose
                     of attracting, retaining and motivating key employees within the group.
                     there were no awards granted to, or vested for, executives under the rep in f16.

 section 3: link between group performance and executive remuneration
 a. company long-term performance against key financial measures
 critical to twe’s transition from an order-taking, agricultural company to a brand-led marketing organisation is
 execution by all regions and functions. ebits growth and ebits margin accretion, together with improved asset
 returns will continue to be underpinned by the company’s focus on portfolio premiumisation, optimisation of brand
 building investment, building stronger and more efficient routes-to-market in key growth regions, and the embedding
 of a cost conscious culture.
 twe’s f16 result demonstrates the benefits of this strategy with the company delivering ebits of $342 million,
 up 29% on a constant currency basis. improved profitability was also delivered in f16, with strong ebits margin
 accretion and significantly enhanced roce.

ii. f16 stip outcomes
executive stip outcomes for f16 are summarised in table 3.2. short-term incentive outcomes were driven
by achievement against executives’ balanced scorecards and specific personal objectives. almost all f16 stip metrics
were fully achieved or overachieved in f16. under the balanced scorecard approach two regional metrics which were
just under target were offset by significant overachievement on other metrics.

iii. f16 ltip awards
the ltip has been designed to provide reward for long-term executive performance and long-term value creation for
shareholders. key terms of the ltip are detailed in section 4.2. the allocation of f16 ltip awards made to executives
are summarised in table 3.3. performance rights have no exercise price. the minimum total value of the grant is zero.
the maximum value is the number of awards granted multiplied by the share price at vesting.

1. the value of ltip awards granted to executives was the face value of the volume weighted average price (vwap) of company shares sold
   on the australian securities exchange over the 90-day period up to and including 30 june 2015 ($5.3166 per share). the value ($) in the
   table above is calculated using the valuation method detailed in note 21 of the financial statements.
2. the revised number of awards reflects the updated number of performance rights allocated to executives after the rights entitlement
   adjustments were made. the additional number of units granted was determined in accordance with the methodology provided to the
   company by an independent third-party advisory firm.
3. this value is calculated using the valuation method detailed in note 21 of the financial statements based on the revised number of awards.
4. the number of awards shown for ms ledrew and mr reeves represent the full f16 ltip grant (and rights entitlement adjustments,
   where applicable). however, upon ceasing employment with the company, ms ledrew and mr reeves were only entitled to retain a pro-rata
   portion of their f16 ltip awards, reflecting the expired portion of the performance period, and subject to post-employment vesting.

iv. ltip vested during f16
the f14 ltip was tested for the performance period ended 30 june 2016. the group’s relative tsr performance over the
three year performance period placed the company at the 77th percentile of its peer group resulting in 100% vesting for
this metric. the earnings per share compound annual growth rate (eps cagr) for the performance period was 12.8%
and excludes the acquisition of the diageo wine business, resulting in vesting at 70.8%. the combined vesting outcome
for the f14 ltip plan is 85.4%.
the vesting schedules for the f14 ltip awards are shown in table 3.4.

section 4: executive remuneration framework
the group’s remuneration strategy and structure is reviewed by the board and the human resources committee
(hrc) for business fit and market relativity on an ongoing basis.
remuneration policy and strategy
the group’s remuneration strategy is designed to:
• attract and retain high-calibre employees by providing competitive remuneration packages in the markets in which
  the group operates;
• motivate employees to deliver exceptional individual and business results by rewarding high performance
  appropriately; and
• align remuneration outcomes directly with the achievement of short-term and long-term business strategies as well
  as shareholder value creation.
the group’s remuneration policy and strategy ensure that remuneration is competitive, performance-focused,
clearly links appropriate reward with desired business performance, and is simple to administer and understand
by executives and shareholders. in accordance with the remuneration policy, remuneration levels and arrangements
are reviewed annually to ensure alignment to market and the group’s stated objectives.
to ensure the variable components of the group’s remuneration structure remain ‘at-risk’, employees may not hedge
against the risk inherent in arrangements such as the ltip or any other equity-based incentive plans. awards will
be forfeited if the policy is breached.
executive shareholding guidelines exist for the ceo and direct reports. under the guidelines, each executive is
encouraged to have control over ordinary shares in the company that are worth at least the equivalent of one year’s
fixed remuneration. executives are expected to meet the guideline over a reasonable period of time (approximately
five years). the group’s variable incentive programs contribute towards executives meeting this guideline.

                                                remuneration report (continued)




a. fixed remuneration
different markets are considered relevant for different executive roles. the group looks at industry and general market
peers, with key quantitative criteria applied (such as market capitalisation and revenue). both australian and global
peers are considered, reflecting the complexity of roles in a global business and the group’s international lens on talent.
executive peer groups are reviewed regularly for accuracy and alignment with the nature of the business.
executives’ fixed remuneration is structured as:
• total fixed remuneration for australian-based executives, which is inclusive of cash salary, mandatory
  employer superannuation contributions, and any other packaged benefits (e.g. novated motor vehicle, additional
  superannuation contributions). executives may also receive non-monetary benefits (wine allocations, event tickets,
  car parking, etc.) as part of their tfr (inclusive of fringe benefits tax). references to ‘fixed remuneration’ in this
  report refer to the tfr component for these executives; or
• base salary plus benefits consistent with local market competitive practice for executives based outside australia,
  and generally vary by country. references to ‘fixed remuneration’ in this report refer to the base salary component
  for these executives.
a remuneration review is conducted annually in july-august, with any changes effective from 1 september.
b. stip
the f16 stip is linked to group ebits and the achievement of group, team and individual metrics.
financial, strategic and operational performance measures apply under a balanced scorecard approach.

                     for executives is 60% and capped at 108%. for the ceo it is 100%, capped at 135% of tfr for
                     maximum performance.
performance          vesting of any stip award is subject to performance against a combination of financial, strategic
measures             and operational measures set at the beginning of the financial year and detailed in executive
                     balanced scorecards.
                     to generate a payment under the f16 stip, threshold performance must be achieved on at least one
                     of the balanced scorecard measures along with at least target individual performance. balanced
                     scorecard measures are individually weighted, and all measures are not required to be achieved
                     in order to deliver a payment under the stip.
                     the board has the discretion to assess stip outcomes more holistically in making any adjustments
                     to the stip outcome. the intention of the board exercising its discretion is to ensure that any
                     stip awards payable are appropriately aligned to twe’s underlying performance and the interests
                     of shareholders.
                     balanced scorecard multiplier
                     individual scorecard measures were set and approved by the board for the ceo, and by the ceo
                     for all other executives, based on 70% financial and 30% strategic and operational measures aligned
                     to delivering twe’s strategic plan.
                     each measure is assessed after the financial year-end against full year audited accounts
                     (where relevant) on a constant currency basis to determine the overall level of performance
                     achieved. using the weighting and the achievement against threshold, target or maximum
                     for each balanced scorecard measure, a balanced scorecard multiplier is determined as part
                     of the stip methodology above.
                     individual multiplier (kpo outcome)
                     in addition to the assessment of balanced scorecards, each executive is also assessed on the
                     achievement of individual kpos relevant to the executive’s area of responsibility, and performance
                     against company behaviours. individuals kpos are set and approved by the board for the ceo,
                     and by the ceo for all other executives.
                     individual kpos are assessed at the financial year-end and an overall performance rating
                     allocated. this rating drives the individual multiplier as part of the stip methodology above.
stip restricted      to further align executive remuneration with shareholder interests, one-third of any executive’s
equity component     f16 stip award is delivered as restricted equity in the form of restricted shares (deferred share
                     rights in jurisdictions where local legislations do not allow the allocation of restricted shares,
                     or cash equivalent in locations where local regulations prohibit or restrict the allocation of equity).
                     the balance of any earned award is delivered as cash.
                     the restricted equity is subject to mandatory restriction periods (one-half of the equity for one
                     year from the allocation date, and the other half for two years from the allocation date) and
                     continued employment with the group. participants are entitled to dividends and voting rights
                     in respect of their restricted shares. participants holding deferred share rights are entitled to
                     neither dividends nor voting rights. the value of any cash equivalent would generally incorporate
                     the value of dividends which would have been paid, had they instead been allocated restricted
                     shares, however do not entitle the participant to any voting rights. the board has absolute
                     discretion as to whether participants retain their unvested restricted equity upon ceasing
                     employment, taking into account the circumstances of their departure.
cessation of         prior to stip payment date – under the stip guidelines for f16, if an executive ceases
employment           employment with the group prior to any stip awards being paid (i.e. september 2016), they are
                     generally not entitled to receive any cash stip payment or corresponding restricted equity.
                     post-stip payment date – if the executive is dismissed for cause, tenders his/her resignation,
                     is terminated for performance reasons (as determined by the board) or commits an act that the
                     board deems to result in forfeiture after stip awards have been allocated, but prior to the relevant
                     vesting dates, then any restricted equity will generally be forfeited. cash payments are not subject
                     to any clawback, should the executive leave the group at any time post-payment date.
change of control    in the event of a change of control, unless the board determines otherwise, the transfer restrictions
                     imposed on the shares will be lifted, but only in so far as to permit the executive to participate
                     in the change of control event. any shares that do not participate in the change of control event
                     will continue to be subject to restrictions until the end of the applicable restriction period.
clawback             the board maintains the discretion to clawback any unvested equity should a clawback event arise,
                     such as (but not limited to) material mis-statement, which was not apparent at the time the equity
                     was awarded.

c. ltip
the ltip is designed to reward executives for long-term performance and long-term value creation for shareholders.
ltip awards are delivered in the form of performance rights. no dividends or voting rights are attached to performance
rights. if the performance conditions are met at the end of the three-year performance period, the relevant portion
of performance rights automatically vests and executives receive a share for each vested performance right. any rights
that do not vest lapse. no amount is payable on the vesting of the performance rights or on their conversion into shares.

i. terms of the f16 ltip
the key terms of the f16 ltip are summarised in table 4.2.
table 4.2: terms of the f16 ltip
element               detail

eligibility           offers were made to select executives and senior leaders as nominated by the ceo and approved
                      by the board.
ceo offer             as a matter of good corporate governance, the company seeks shareholder approval for ceo ltip
                      equity grants. following approval at the 2015 agm (12 november 2015) f16 ltip offers were granted
                      on 4 december 2015. the company will seek shareholder approval at the 2016 agm for an f17 ltip
                      offer to the ceo.
performance           the performance period for the f16 ltip is three years – from 1 july 2015 to 30 june 2018.
period                the board considers three years an appropriate performance period as it is aligned to market
                      practice and is sufficiently long-term to influence the desired performance outcomes, whilst providing
                      a foreseeable and genuine incentive to participants.
performance           the f16 ltip is subject to two performance measures which are weighted equally and assessed at
measures              the end of the performance period. the board chose performance measures that align management’s
                      long-term interests with those of shareholders. these measures are considered consistent with
                      market practice and are easily understood by both participants and shareholders.
                      • relative tsr provides shareholder alignment by taking into consideration the increase in share
                        price as well as dividends paid. the relative measure supports competitive returns against other
                        comparable organisations. twe applies a 90-day volume-weighted average price (vwap) to
                        determine the start and ending share price to determine the relative tsr measure.
                      • the peer group for relative tsr comprises companies within the s&p/asx 200 index, excluding
                        companies from the energy, metal and mining, real estate and finance global industry classification
                        standards sectors (106 companies at the start of the performance period). this peer group was
                        chosen as these organisations exhibit similar characteristics in terms of business cyclicality, market
                        capitalisation, stock volatility and business operations, and provide a sufficiently large population
                        to minimise the risk of attrition. the relative tsr peer group remains relatively broad as there are
                        too few industry peers (i.e. within the consumer goods/distillers and vintners subgroup) to make
                        additional sector exclusions viable.
                      • roce growth is a new measure in f16 and is aimed at driving improvements in capital
                        efficiency. roce is widely regarded as a metric well suited to a capital intensive business,
                        and encourages growth in earnings on an optimised cost base.
                      • roce is calculated as ebits divided by average capital employed (at constant currency).
                        capital employed is the sum of average net assets (excluding sgara) and average net debt.
                        the board retains the discretion to adjust the roce performance condition to ensure that
                        participants are not penalised nor provided with a windfall benefit arising from matters
                        outside of management’s control that affect roce.

table 4.2: terms of the f16 ltip (continued)
element                    detail

ltip opportunity           the maximum value of an individual’s ltip opportunity is determined at the time of offer and is set
                           as a percentage of a participant’s fixed remuneration. the percentage of fixed remuneration varies
                           depending on the individual’s role and is 200% for the ceo and generally 150% for the other executives.
                           for f16, the number of performance rights allocated was based on the 90-day vwap preceding
                           1 july 2015 (the start of the performance period).
hedging                    the terms and conditions surrounding the f16 ltip do not allow participants to hedge against
                           future performance by entering into any separate equity or other arrangements.
cessation of               if an executive ceases employment before the end of the performance period, unvested performance
employment                 rights will generally lapse.
                           in exceptional circumstances (such as redundancy, death or disability), the board, in its discretion, may
                           determine that a portion of the award is retained having regard to performance and time lapsed to date
                           of cessation (or that an equivalent cash payment be made). retained awards will generally be subject to
                           post-employment vesting, where the participant must continue to hold the relevant performance rights
                           until the end of the performance period, and be subject to the performance conditions under the plan.
change                     if a change of control event is to occur, the board has discretion to determine that all or a portion
of control                 of the award will vest, and may have regard to performance and time elapsed to the date of change
                           of control in exercising that discretion.
clawback                   the board maintains the discretion to clawback any unvested equity should a clawback event arise,
                           such as (but not limited to) material mis-statement, which was not apparent at the time the equity
                           was awarded.


ii. terms of the f17 ltip
no changes are proposed to the structure of the ltip in f17. the revised roce vesting schedule for f17 is detailed
in table 4.3. for the purposes of the f17 ltip, roce growth will be measured against the f16 roce base of 9.6%.

ii. 2016 share cellar
during f16, the 2016 share cellar plan was launched with deductions commencing in april 2016. actual share
acquisitions under the plan will be completed in f17. enrolment rates for the second year offer of share cellar
were at a similar level to the original offer in 2015. all executives as at 30 june 2016 are enrolled in the
2016 share cellar plan.
iii. 2017 share cellar
to continue to encourage employees to build shareholdings in the group, and align the interests of group employees
with shareholder interests and the performance of the group as a whole, the maximum possible contribution limit for
share cellar will be increased in 2017 from $3,000 to $5,000 subject to affordability on a year by year basis.
e. prior years’ equity arrangements
the following section details all outstanding equity arrangements, including relevant f16 vesting events, for executives.
e.1 stip restricted equity
restricted equity allocated in respect of the f15 stip is currently outstanding as detailed in table 4.5. no awards
were made in respect of the f14 stip or f13 stip as performance conditions under the plan were not met.

1. table 4.5 reports only executives who were kmp at 30 june 2016. as mr meehan joined the group during f16, there was no f15 stip
   award made (including restricted equity).
2. the value at allocation date is calculated based on the allocation price ($6.125, the five-day vwap up to and including the allocation date).
3. due to regulatory filings which were required to be made in china prior to the allocation of restricted shares, mr foye’s allocation
   under the f15 stip rep was delayed. this resulted in mr foye not being registered as a shareholder on the record date and accordingly
   not receiving the retail premium for the restricted shares. mr foye received in cash the renounceable value of the restricted shares that
   he was entitled to at the record date, being 19 october 2015, which was paid in december 2015. this cash amount is included in table 6.1.
4. as mr foye is remunerated in us$, his local currency stip award was converted to a$ at the payment date (15 september 2015) in order
   to determine the number of restricted shares to be allocated. therefore, the final a$ amount varies to that disclosed in the f15
   remuneration report.

section 7: non-executive director remuneration
a. non-executive director fee pool
the board determines the fees payable to non-executive directors within the current maximum aggregate fee pool
of $2,200,000 per annum (inclusive of superannuation guarantee contributions and any fees that a non-executive
director elects to sacrifice on a pre-tax basis). this fee pool has not been increased since 2012, when it was last
approved by shareholders at the 2012 annual general meeting (agm).
it is proposed that the non-executive director fee pool be increased to $2,500,000 in f17 subject to shareholder approval
at the company’s 2016 agm. the board believes it appropriate to increase the non-executive director fee pool to provide
the company with flexibility for future adjustments to annual fees, competitive with comparable companies, thereby
enabling the company to maintain and attract high calibre non-executive directors with the appropriate experience,
expertise, skills and diversity to oversee the company’s business and strategic direction. also, as previously announced
to the market, an additional non-executive director, ms lauri shanahan, was appointed to the board effective 1 november
2016. further details will be included in the company’s 2016 notice of agm.
b. non-executive director fee policy
in setting the level of non-executive directors’ fees, the following factors are taken into account:
• risks and responsibilities of the role;
• global reach and complexity of the business;
• director skills and experience; and
• market benchmark data provided by independent external consultants.
non-executive directors are remunerated by way of base board fees (for their service as a director of the board)
and additional committee fees (for membership of, or chairing, a committee). the chairman of the board, taking
into account the greater time commitment required, receives a higher base fee, but does not receive any additional
payment for service on committees.
in order to maintain independence, non-executive directors do not participate in the company’s incentive plans
and they do not receive retirement benefits other than the superannuation contributions disclosed in this report.

c. non-executive director shareholdings
non-executive directors are encouraged to hold shares in the company, and are required to build their shareholding
to the equivalent of one year’s base fees over a reasonable period of time. in order to support this the company operates
the director share acquisition plan (dsap). the dsap operates by applying a portion of directors’ after-tax fees
to acquire the company’s shares on the asx on a periodic basis at the prevailing market rate.
d. non-executive director fees
non-executive director base fees increased during f16, effective 1 april 2016, for the first time since the demerger
of treasury wine estates in may 2011. the fee for the chairman of the board and member fees for the hrc also
increased. other committee fees remain unchanged. the increases were based on advice from the committee’s
independent remuneration adviser and were made in order to remain competitive in the market, noting the increasing
global operations, scale and complexity of the group.
current annual base fees and committee fees are detailed in table 7.1.

the above fees were effective from 1 april 2016 and are inclusive of superannuation.
1. the chairman fee was increased from $390,000 per annum to $440,000 per annum, effective 1 april 2016.
2. the non-executive director base fee was increased from $130,000 per annum to $160,000 per annum, effective 1 april 2016.
3. the hrc base fee was increased from $15,000 per annum to $20,000 per annum effective 1 april 2016.
4. currently, the chairman of the board is also the chairman of the nominations committee, thereby not receiving any additional fees
   for this role.

non-executive directors elect how they wish to receive their total fees – e.g. as a combination of cash, contributions
to the dsap, superannuation contributions or charitable donations.
in addition to the above fees, non-executive directors receive a wine allowance. currently, overseas-based directors
are also entitled to a travel allowance. the travel allowance is intended to compensate the overseas-directors for travel
undertaken in their duties, in addition to any business-related expenses that may be incurred in carrying out their
duties, and it has previously been agreed that the travel allowance will cease at the end of f18. details of the travel
allowance applicable for f16 are set out in table 7.2.
travel costs are not included in base fees but are paid to non-executive directors as appropriate so that it is a targeted
spend for the business to compensate for actual travel taken during the year.

note 3 – revenue and other income (continued)
types of products and services
the group generates revenue through the sale of branded wines, principally as a finished, bottled product. the group’s
wine portfolio includes some of the world’s leading commercial, masstige and luxury wine brands such as penfolds,
beringer, lindeman’s, wolf blass, stags’ leap, chateau st jean, beaulieu vineyard and sterling vineyards.
the group also distributes beer and cider under licence in new zealand and provides contract bottling services
to third parties.
sales approach
the group distributes wine to a range of customers across the world, with routes to market tailored by country. in some
geographies, wine is sold principally to large distributors. in others, the majority of sales are direct to national retail
chains, independent retailers and on premise outlets. the group also has some limited sales direct to the consumer.
the group has two major customers whose revenues represent 15.4% (f15: 17.4%) and 9.0% (f15: 10.2%) of reported
revenues. the customers are in the americas and anz segments respectively.

accounting policies
revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. as the group does not generally
provide extended credit terms, this is typically the amount shown on the invoice. revenue is recorded net of sales
discounts and rebates, duties and taxes. revenue is recorded only if it is probable that the economic benefits will flow
to the group, such as when product is sold to a credit approved purchaser.
the following specific criteria are also applied:
wine
revenue is recognised when the risk and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer. sales to national retail chains,
domestic distributors, independent retailers and on premise outlets are usually recognised when goods are delivered.
sales to international distributors are recognised based on the international commercial terms the goods are shipped
under, but typically when goods are despatched. this is also the case for some national retail chains that manage their
own distribution networks.
property
revenue from the sale of properties is recognised when an executed contract becomes unconditional.
royalties
revenue is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.
bottling services
revenue is recognised when the relevant service has been completed.

key estimate and judgement:

volume discounts and rebates
products are often sold with volume discounts and other rebates. sales are recorded based on the price specified in the
sales contracts, net of the estimated discount or rebate at the time of sale. accumulated experience is used to estimate
and provide for the discounts based on anticipated annual purchases.

in accordance with aasb 133 earnings per share, the comparative earnings per share calculations have been restated
for the bonus element of the two-for-fifteen share rights issue undertaken in october 2015. the previously reported
june 2015 weighted average number of shares has been adjusted by a factor of 1.02, being the market price of one
ordinary share at the close of the last day at which the shares traded together with the rights $6.57, divided by the
theoretical ex-rights value per share of $6.46.

calculation of earnings per share
earnings per share (eps) is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share.
basic eps is calculated by dividing the net profit after income tax attributable to ordinary shareholders
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
diluted eps is determined by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders after tax by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period (adjusted for the effects of dilutive potential
ordinary shares in the employee long-term incentive plan and restricted equity plan (see note 21)).

inventories of wine stocks are classified between current and non-current based on sales projections for the ensuing
year. inventories recognised as an expense during the year and included in cost of sales amounted to $1,417.1 million
(f15: $1,170.0 million). in f16, the write-down of inventories to net realisable value amounted to $23.4 million
(f15: $16.9 million). the reversal of write-downs amounted to $7.3 million (f15: $3.5 million). these amounts
are included in cost of sales.

note 9 – working capital (continued)

accounting policies
cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, cash in transit, short-term
deposits and investments with maturities of three months or less.
cash assets and cash liabilities are offset and presented as a net amount in the statement of financial position
when the group has a legally enforceable right to offset or intent to settle on a net basis.
for the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are disclosed net
of outstanding bank overdrafts.
receivables
trade receivables are initially recognised at invoice value (fair value) and subsequently measured at amortised cost,
less allowance for doubtful debts.
credit terms are generally between 30–120 days depending on the nature of the transaction. an allowance for
doubtful debts is raised to reduce the carrying amount of trade receivables based on a review of outstanding amounts
at reporting date where there is potential credit risk.
inventories
inventories are valued at the lower of their cost (using average or fifo basis) or estimated net realisable value.
the cost of raw materials is their purchase price or, in the case of grapes sourced from group owned vineyards,
fair value (see note 11 for further details). the cost of manufactured goods is determined on a consistent basis
and is made up of the raw materials and direct labour used in manufacture. it also includes other direct costs
and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs
of completion and estimated costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
trade and other payables
trade and other payables including accruals are recorded when the group is required to make future payments
as a result of purchases of goods or services. trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost.

key estimate and judgement:

volume discounts and rebates
key estimates relate to the amount accrued for discounts and rebates. products are often sold with volume discounts
and other rebates. sales are recorded based on the price specified in the sales contracts, net of the estimated discount
or rebate at the time of sale. accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and rebates
based on anticipated annual purchases and depletions.

the period over which some wine inventories are converted from raw materials to finished goods can be a significant
length of time. failure to forecast demand effectively may result in excess inventories or missed revenue opportunities.
forecast demand and market prices can vary significantly over the holding period up to the likely date of sale.
estimating the most likely conditions at the expected point of sale is therefore more challenging over the longer term.
non-current inventory is $678.4 million (f15: $533.8 million) and its estimated selling price is therefore a key estimate.

included within plant and equipment are ‘projects in progress’ of $110.5 million (f15: $51.4 million), which are assets
under construction and therefore not yet depreciated. the cost of construction includes the cost of materials used
in construction, direct labour on the project, and an allocation of overheads.

accounting policies
property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost and then reduced by accumulated depreciation and any
impairment losses.
plant and equipment is depreciated so that the assets are written down to their residual value over their useful lives,
using a reducing balance or straight-line method depending on the nature of the asset. assets that relate to leases
are written-off over the period of the lease or useful life, whichever is the shorter. residual values, useful lives and
amortisation methods are reviewed annually and adjusted when required. no changes to depreciation rates were
made this year.
depreciation expense is included in ‘costs of sales’, ‘selling expenses’ and ‘administration expenses’ in the statement
of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
the depreciation rates used for each class of asset are as follows:

freehold buildings and improvements                    1.5%–10.0%
leasehold buildings and improvements                  10.0%–20.0%
plant and equipment                                    3.3%–40.0%

de-recognition and disposal
when an asset is sold, scrapped or is no longer of use to the business it is derecognised. any gain or loss arising on
de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset)
is recorded in the period the asset is derecognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

grape growing and sourcing
the group has a variety of sources of fruit including owned and leased vineyards, contracted growers and the bulk
wine market.
this approach provides flexibility through the economic cycle and assists with managing the risks arising from
agricultural factors beyond the group’s control such as pests, disease and extreme weather conditions.
the group owned vineyards ensure access to super premium fruit from key viticultural regions including the barossa
valley and coonawarra in australia, marlborough in new zealand and the napa and sonoma valleys in california.
these vineyards contribute to some of the group’s most prestigious wines.

note 11 – agricultural assets (continued)

accounting policies
the agricultural assets of the group (principally vines) are measured at their fair value, less estimated point
of sale costs.
the net change in their fair value over the year is recognised within ‘other expenses’ in the statement of profit
or loss and other comprehensive income.
prior to harvest, grapes are considered as part of the agricultural asset and included in its fair value.
harvested grapes are transferred to inventory initially at fair value and are then subsequently accounted
for in the cost of inventory (see note 9).
costs incurred in maintaining agricultural assets are recognised as an expense as incurred.
fair value determination
the valuations of agricultural assets are level 2 fair value measurements under the group’s accounting policy
(see note 1), with the principal inputs being:

vines
determined with reference to both independent valuations of the relevant vineyards and the market price
of purchased vines (rootlings).

grapes prior to harvest
estimated based on the expected yields per hectare, forecasted harvest costs and the anticipated market price
of grapes.

harvested grapes
determined by reference to the weighted district average of grape prices for each region for the current vintage.
prices vary with the grade quality of grapes produced in each particular region.

key estimate and judgement:

fair value of vines
key to estimating the value of vines is the identification of factors that could have a long-term impact on the
viability of the vines and the measurement of the impact a change in these factors have on the valuation of vines.
these are typically site dependent.
in addition, the estimated fair value of both vines and unharvested grapes could change if:
• yield estimates were higher/(lower);
• the estimated harvest costs were lower/(higher);
• market prices for grapes were higher/(lower); or
• the quality of grapes was higher/(lower).

indefinite life brands
brand names with a carrying value of $934.0 million (f15: $731.7 million) are assessed as having an indefinite useful life.
the indefinite useful life reflects the group’s intention to continue to manufacture or distribute these brands to generate
net cash inflows into the foreseeable future.

key estimate and judgement:

useful life of brand names
in assessing whether a brand has a finite or indefinite useful life, the group makes use of information on the long-term
strategy for the brand, the level of growth or decline of the markets that the brand operates in, the history of the market
and the brand’s position within that market.
if a brand is assessed to have a finite life, the group will use judgement in determining the useful life of the brand
and will consider the period over which expected cash flows will continue to be derived in making that decision.

note 12 – intangible assets (continued)

accounting policies
brand names and licences
brand names are recognised as assets when purchased individually and (primarily) as part of the allocation
of the purchase price when the group acquires other businesses. internally generated brand names are not
capitalised and expenditure incurred in developing, maintaining or enhancing brand names is charged to profit
or loss in the year incurred.
brand names are initially recognised at cost when purchased individually and at fair value when acquired with
a business. this fair value is determined by reference to independent valuations.
following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any
accumulated impairment losses.
the useful lives of brand names have been assessed to be indefinite and therefore are not amortised.

goodwill
goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses and represents the difference between the purchase price and share
of the net assets of the acquired business, recorded at fair value.
following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. goodwill is not
amortised but is tested for impairment (see note 14).

it development and software
costs incurred in developing information technology (it) products or systems and costs incurred in acquiring
software and multi-year licenses are capitalised as intangible it assets. they include the cost of purchased software
and internal labour and contractors used in the development of software.
it assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and are amortised over their expected useful life
(2–10 years) on a straight line basis. amortisation is included in ‘other expenses’ in the statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income.

americas segment
the americas assets held for sale comprise assets acquired as part of the diageo chateau & estates acquisition
($59.1 million) which are surplus to requirements and include paicines and acacia wineries as well as rutherford
house. the carrying value of total assets held for sale include land and buildings $41.0 million, plant and equipment
$17.2 million and agricultural assets of $0.9 million.
anz segment
the anz assets held for sale relate to ryecroft winery, matua auckland winery as well as select vineyard assets which
are surplus to requirements. the carrying value comprises land and buildings $14.4 million, plant and equipment
$24.2 million and vineyards $1.1 million.

accounting policies
non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their value will be recovered principally through their sale,
rather than through ongoing use within the business.
assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. they are valued at the lower of
their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with an impairment loss recognised for any difference. a gain
is recognised for any subsequent increase in value, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously
recognised. any gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset is recognised
at that point. the fair values of the assets based on independent market appraisals exceed the assets’ carrying values.

note 14 – impairment of non-financial assets
in f16, the recoverable amounts of cash generating units (cgus) exceed their carrying values and as a result no
impairment has been recognised (f15: nil). there were no indications that previously recognised impairment losses
should be reversed (f15: nil). the recoverable amount was determined through a value in use calculation.
the group’s cgus are consistent with the prior period and are:
• americas;
• europe; and
• australia and new zealand (anz).

accounting policies
timing of impairment testing
the group tests property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment:
• at least annually for goodwill and indefinite life brands; and
• where there are indications that an asset may be impaired; or
• where there is an indication that previously recognised impairments may have changed
impairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
approach to impairment testing
if the asset does not generate independent cash inflows and its value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair
value, the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cgu to which it belongs.
when an asset’s (or cgu’s) carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, it is impaired. recoverable amount
is the higher of the asset’s (or cgu’s) fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
fair value is determined in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 1.
in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu.
reversals of impairment
if there is an indicator that a previously recognised impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased, recoverable
amount is estimated. if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine an asset’s recoverable amount
since an impairment loss was recognised, the carrying value of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount
(limited to the amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised
for the asset in prior years).
any reversal is recognised in profit or loss with an adjustment to depreciation in future periods to allocate the asset’s
revised carrying value, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. the group does
not reverse impairments recognised for goodwill.

note 14 – impairment of non-financial assets (continued)

key estimate and judgement:

impairment testing key assumptions
cash flow forecasts
cash flow forecasts are based on the group’s most recent five-year financial plans approved by the board.
key assumptions in the cash flow forecasts include sales volume growth, cost of sales and cost of doing business.
the group’s assumptions regarding sales volume growth and costs of doing business are based on expectations
of the market demand and past experience. the assumption on cost of sales is based on expectation about future
vintage costs.
this approach is consistent with the prior period.
long-term growth rates
cash flow forecasts beyond a five-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.5% (f15: 2.7%).
discount rate
the group applies a post-tax discount rate to post-tax cash flows as the valuation calculated using this method
closely approximates applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows. the post-tax discount rates incorporate
a risk-adjustment relative to the risks associated with the net post-tax cash flows being achieved. the group used
the following pre-tax discount rates:
                                                                                                    2016             2015

europe                                                                                            11.6%         13.5%
anz                                                                                               12.8%         13.1%

exchange rates
cash flow forecasts in foreign currency are forecast in that currency and discounted using the applicable regional
discount rates (predominantly usd and gbp).
sensitivity analysis
increases in discount rates or changes in other key assumptions, such as operating conditions or financial performance,
may cause the recoverable amount to fall below carrying values.
based on current economic conditions and cgu performances, there are no reasonably possible changes to key
assumptions used in the determination of cgu recoverable amounts that would result in a material impairment
to the group.

onerous contract provisions are held for non-cancellable leases, it infrastructure service contracts and wine grape supply
contracts that have been identified as being surplus to the group’s needs. the restructuring provision balance comprises
costs in relation to the group’s supply chain optimisation program and group rationalisation and restructure program.

accounting policies
provisions are recognised for present obligations (legal, equitable or constructive) to make future payments
(or other transfer of value) to other entities due to past transactions or events. they are recognised only when
it is probable the liability will arise and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount.
if the effect of time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash
flows at a pre-tax risk free rate plus, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. where discounting is used,
the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
employee entitlements
liabilities for employees’ entitlements to wages and salaries, annual leave and other current employee entitlements
(that are expected to be paid within 12 months) are measured at amounts expected to be paid as at the reporting date.
liabilities for other employee entitlements, which are not expected to be paid or settled within 12 months of reporting
date, are accrued in respect of all employees at the present value of future amounts expected to be paid.
restructuring
restructuring provisions are recognised at the point when a detailed plan for the restructure has been developed
and implementation has commenced. the cost of restructuring provided is the estimated future cash flows, discounted
at the appropriate rate which reflects the risks of the cash flow.
termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. the group recognises termination benefits
when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of a current employee according to a detailed
formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or upon the provision of an offer to encourage voluntary redundancy.
onerous contracts
onerous contracts are measured at the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost
of continuing with the contract (discounted to present value if material).

note 16 – capital management
the group considers capital to be the combination of shareholders’ equity, reserves and net debt. the key objectives
of the group’s approach to capital management include:
• safeguard the company’s ability to continue as a going concern;
• maintaining a credit profile and the requisite financial metrics that secures access to funding with a spread
  of maturity dates and sufficient undrawn committed facility capacity;
• optimising over the long term, and to the extent practicable, the weighted average cost of capital to reduce the group’s
  cost of capital while maintaining financial flexibility; and
• to provide returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders.
in order to optimise the group’s capital structure and in line with the group’s strategic objectives and operating plans,
the company may:
• alter the amount of dividends paid to shareholders;
• return capital to shareholders;
• issue new shares;
• vary discretionary capital expenditure;
• draw-down additional debt; or
• sell assets to reduce debt.
various financial ratios and internal targets are assessed and reported to the board on a regular basis
by management to monitor and support the key objectives set out above. these ratios and targets include:
• an earnings to net interest expense ratio;
• a total net indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and self-generating
  and regenerating assets ratio; and
• group debt maturity profile.

note 17 – borrowings (continued)
financial guarantees
the group has financial guarantees to other persons of $23.2 million (f15: $27.5 million) that could be called upon
at any time in the event of a breach of the group’s financial obligations. the group does not expect any payments will
eventuate under these financial guarantees as the group is expected to meet respective obligations to the beneficiaries
of these guarantees.

accounting policies
borrowings are initially recorded at fair value of the consideration received, net of directly attributable costs.
after initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. amortised
cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on issuance. gains and losses are
recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income if borrowings are derecognised.

the shares have no par value.
ordinary shares
ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the company
in proportion to the number of and amounts paid on the shares held. ordinary shares entitle their holder to one vote,
either in person or by proxy, at a meeting of the company. incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax from the proceeds.
treasury shares
included within ordinary fully paid shares are 1.3 million (f15: 0.9 million) shares which are available to satisfy
any entitlements which vest under the company’s employee equity plans (set out in note 21). share options exercised
during the reporting period are satisfied with treasury shares.
when the company reacquires its equity instruments (treasury shares) their cost is deducted from equity. no gain or loss
is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of treasury shares. any difference between
the cost of acquisition and the consideration when reissued is recognised in share-based payments reserve.

the group’s leases of property expire between one and 20 years. leases generally provide us with a right of renewal at
which time all terms are renegotiated. during the year the group acquired operating leases as part of the acquisition
of diageo chateau & estates.

accounting policies
leases
the determination of which of the group’s arrangements are leases can be complex; for example determining whether
long term contracts are for the supply of grapes or a lease of the vineyard. the assessment is made based on the substance
of the arrangement, whether it is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and if it conveys a right of use.
when an arrangement is a lease, it is accounted for in one of two ways. where the lessor retains substantially
all the risks and benefits of ownership of an asset it is classified as operating leases. operating lease payments
are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the statement of profit or loss and
other comprehensive income.
where the group takes on substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased item it is classified
as a finance lease. an asset is recognised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower,
at the present value of the minimum lease payments. lease payments are split between a finance expense and
a reduction of the lease liability so as to record a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.

the group operates equity plans as outlined below:
f15 short term incentive plan (stip) restricted equity
one-third of earned stip is delivered in the form of deferred equity (restricted shares/deferred share rights).
the key terms of this award are:
• subject to a mandatory two-year disposal restriction period and continued employment;
• holders of restricted shares are entitled to dividends and to exercise their voting rights during the restriction;
• will generally be forfeited if the executive is dismissed for cause or resigns. clawback mechanisms also exist.
f16 stip restricted equity
one-third of earned stip is delivered in the form of deferred equity (restricted shares). the key terms of this award are:
• subject to a mandatory restriction period and continued employment. half of the award is restricted for one year
  and the remaining half for two years from grant date;
• holders of restricted shares are entitled to dividends and to exercise their voting rights during the restriction;
• will generally be forfeited if the executive is dismissed for cause or resigns. clawback mechanisms apply.
ltip
under the ltip certain employees receive performance rights, which entitle participants to receive the company’s
shares at no cost subject to the achievement of performance conditions and continued employment. no dividends
are payable to participants prior to vesting.
for the f14 and f15 award, performance rights are subject to dual performance measures with equal weighting over
a performance period of three years.
• relative total shareholder return (tsr)
• earnings per share (eps) compound annual growth rate (cagr)
• will generally be forfeited if the executive is dismissed for cause or resigns. clawback mechanisms apply.
for the f16 award, performance rights are subject to dual performance measures with equal weighting over
a performance period of three years.
• relative total shareholder return (tsr)
• return on capital employed (roce) growth
• will generally be forfeited if the executive is dismissed for cause or resigns. clawback mechanisms apply.
restricted equity plan (rep)
under the rep, certain employees receive a grant of restricted equity awards in the form of restricted shares.
if restricted shares cannot be awarded (e.g. due to country specific regulation) deferred share rights are granted.
the award is at no cost to the employee and is subject to a restriction period. restricted equity awards require
continued employment with the group through the restriction period. other terms are similar to the stip terms above.
restricted equity awards may be granted to compensate employees for foregoing equity compensation in their previous
organisation as a sign-on award and/or as a retention incentive.
share cellar (broad-based employee share plan)
share cellar is the group’s broad-based employee share plan and plan participation is offered annually. the plan was
first launched early in 2015. participation is voluntary and employees in select countries are eligible to join the plan.
share cellar operates as a matching plan whereby employees contribute funds to the plan from their after-tax pay and
shares are acquired by the group on their behalf. if the individual continues to hold their shares, and remains an
employee of the group at the vesting date (approximately two years), the group will grant one matched share for every
two purchased shares they hold.
participants are entitled to dividends and to exercise voting rights attached to the shares purchased under the plan,
and matched shares once they have been allocated.

note 21 – employee equity plans (continued)

accounting policies
employee equity plans are accounted for as share-based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for
the awards. the fair value of the shares and performance rights that are expected to vest is progressively recognised
as an employee benefits expense over the relevant vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
the fair value of shares granted is determined by reference to observed market values. the fair value of the tsr
component of performance rights is independently determined at grant date by an external valuer using a monte-carlo
simulation. for the non-market components (eps cagr), the fair value is independently determined based on the share
price less the present value of dividends.
non-market performance conditions do not impact the value of shares and performance rights, but rather the estimate
of the number of shares to vest.
at each reporting date the company revises the estimate of the number of shares and the non-market component
of performance rights that are expected to vest and the employee benefits expense recognised each period incorporates
this change in estimate.
an expense is recognised for the tsr component of performance rights whether or not the tsr hurdle is met.
no expense is recognised if these rights do not vest due to cessation of employment. no expense is recognised for
shares and non-market components of performance rights that do not ultimately vest.

unrecognised tax assets
there are potential future income tax benefits relating to accumulated losses in non-australian group companies,
which have not been brought to account. these possible benefits amount to $66.6 million (f15: $96.8 million).
the group has carry forward capital tax losses in australia and the uk respectively. these losses may be used
to offset any future capital gains derived by activities in these countries. the group will assess the conditions for
deductibility imposed by the tax laws of australia and the uk prior to any utilisation of the capital losses.
ongoing tax audits
the group is subject to ongoing tax audits by taxation authorities in several jurisdictions covering a variety of taxes.
the group fully cooperates with these enquiries as and when they arise.
franking credits
the australian tax consolidation group has $9.5 million (f15: nil) franking credits available for subsequent
reporting periods.

key estimate and judgement:

taxation
the group is subject to income taxes in australia and jurisdictions where it has foreign operations. significant judgement
is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. there are many transactions and calculations
undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. where the final
tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact
the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

note 22 – income tax (continued)

accounting policies
current taxes
current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, taxation
authorities at the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
deferred taxes
deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. deferred income tax assets
are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses,
to the extent it is probable that they will be utilised.
unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent
that it will become possible that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
the carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise them.
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date.
deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences at balance sheet date between accounting carrying amounts
and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, other than for:
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time
  of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or on the recognition of goodwill.
• foreign taxes which may arise in the event of retained profits of foreign controlled entities being remitted to
  australia as there is no present intention to make any such remittances.
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities associated with indefinite life intangibles such as brand names are
measured based on the tax consequences that would follow from the sale of that asset.
income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in profit or loss.
offsetting deferred tax balances
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxation authority.

note 23 – financial risk management
financial risk management framework
the group’s financial risk management policies (‘group treasury policies’) cover risk tolerance, internal controls
(including segregation of duties), delegated authority levels, management of foreign currency, interest rate and
counterparty credit exposures, and the reporting of exposures. these policies are reviewed at least annually
and approved by the board of directors.
the centralised group treasury function has been delegated operational responsibility for the identification and
management of financial risks.
the group holds financial instruments from financing (principally borrowings), transactions (trade debtors and creditors)
and risk management (derivatives) which result in exposure to the following financial risks, covered by the group
treasury policies:
• liquidity risk;
• interest rate risk;
• foreign exchange risk; and
• counterparty credit risk.
the following table outlines how these risks impact group financial assets and liabilities:

  against capitalised facility finance costs of $4.8 million (f15: $2.9 million) to be amortised over the facility period.

(b) interest rate risk
nature of the risk
the group is exposed to interest rate risk principally from floating rate borrowings, including bank borrowings and
us private placement notes. other sources of interest rate risk include receivable purchasing agreements, interest-bearing
investments, creditors’ accounts offering a discount and debtors’ accounts on which discounts are offered.

risk management
the group manages interest rate risk by ensuring that the sensitivity of forecast future earnings to changes in interest
rates is within acceptable limits. this involves longer term forecasting of both expected earnings and expected borrowing
to determine the tolerable exposure.

(c) foreign exchange risk
nature of the risk
the group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through:
• transaction exposures including sales of wine into export markets and the purchase of production inputs,
  denominated in foreign currencies other than the respective functional currency of the specific group entity;
• exposures arising from borrowings denominated in foreign currencies; and
• translation exposures including earnings of foreign subsidiaries and revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities,
  including borrowings.
the currencies in which these transactions are primarily denominated are the australian dollar (aud), united states
dollar (usd) and great british pound (gbp). other currencies used include the canadian dollar, euro, new zealand
dollar, singapore dollar, swedish krona, norwegian krone and south african rand.
risk management
the focus of the group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is on the transactional exposures arising from
the sourcing and sale of wine.
a proportion of expenses are hedged over time up to a period of three years. the timing, nominal amount and average
price of the instruments in place at 30 june 2016 are disclosed in the table on the following page.
in determining the amount of hedging required, the group also considers the ‘natural hedges’ arising from
the underlying net cash flows in the relevant currency, comprising operating, investing and financing cash flows.

(d) credit risk
nature of the risk
counterparty credit risk arises primarily from the following assets:
• cash and cash equivalents;
• trade and other receivables; and
• derivative instruments.
risk management
the group’s counterparty credit risk management philosophy is to limit the group’s loss from default by any one
counterparty by dealing only with financial institution counterparties of good credit standing, setting maximum exposure
limits for each counterparty, and taking a conservative approach to the calculation of counterparty credit limit usage.
where available, credit opinions on counterparties from two credit rating agencies are used to determine credit limits.
the group assesses the credit quality of individual customers prior to offering credit terms and continue to monitor
on a regular basis. each customer is assigned a risk profile based upon the measurable risk indicators for dishonoured
payments, adverse information and average days late along with the securities and guarantees held. all prospective
accounts are required to complete a credit application and generally a director’s guarantee is required with minimal
exceptions. failure to provide a director’s guarantee results in either no credit or a limited level of credit offered.
credit terms may be reduced or extended for individual customers on the basis of risk.
past due accounts are subject to a number of collection activities which range from telephone contact, suspension
of orders through to legal action. past due accounts are reviewed monthly with specific focus on accounts that are
greater than 90 days overdue. where debt cannot be recovered, it is escalated from the credit representative to the
credit manager to initiate recovery action.
for derivatives, the group transacts under an international swaps and derivatives association (isda) master netting
agreement. if a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under an isda agreement are
terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.
level of exposure at balance date
the maximum counterparty credit risk exposure at 30 june 2016 in respect of derivative financial instruments was
$5.1 million (f15: $2.7 million) and in respect of cash and cash equivalents was $53.7 million (f15: $21.0 million).
the group’s authorised counterparties are restricted to banks and financial institutions whose long term credit rating
is at or above a standard and poors rating of bbb+ (or moody’s equivalent rating of baa1). the magnitude of credit
risk in relation to receivables is generally the carrying amount, net of any provisions for doubtful debts. the ageing
of the consolidated group trade receivables (net of provisions) is outlined below:

trade receivables have been aged according to their original due date. terms may be extended on a temporary basis

note 24 – derivative financial instruments
at reporting date there were $192.0 million (australian dollar equivalent) net face value of outstanding foreign exchange
contracts at contract rates (f15: $630.3 million) and interest rate swaps of $402.8 million (f15: $130.3 million).
these instruments are regarded as being level 2 under aasb’s fair value measurement hierarchy.


note 25 – fair values
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets and most financial liabilities approximate their carrying
value. the fair value of the us private placement notes is $401.6 million (f15: $333.8 million). there have been no
reclassifications of financial assets from fair value to cost, or from cost or amortised cost to fair value during the year.
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are based upon market prices, or models using inputs observed from
the market, where markets exist or have been determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by the current
interest rate for financial assets and financial liabilities with similar risk profiles (a level 2 valuation).
the valuation of derivative financial assets and liabilities reflects the estimated amounts which the group would be
required to pay or receive to terminate the contracts (net of transaction costs) or replace the contracts at their current
market rates at reporting date. this is based on internal valuations using standard valuation techniques.
as the purpose of these derivative financial instruments is to hedge the group’s underlying assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge against risk of interest rate fluctuations, it is unlikely in the absence
of abnormal circumstances that these contracts would be terminated prior to maturity.
for all other recognised financial assets and financial liabilities, based on the facts and circumstances existing
at reporting date and the nature of the group’s financial assets and financial liabilities including hedge positions,
the group has no reason to believe that the financial assets could not be exchanged, or the financial liabilities could
not be settled, in an arm’s length transaction at an amount approximating its carrying amount.


note 26 – class action
on 2 july 2014, brian jones, represented by maurice blackburn, commenced a funded class action in the federal
court of australia (new south wales registry) for unspecified damages on behalf of shareholders who acquired
the company’s shares between 17 august 2012 and 15 july 2013. mr jones alleges that the company engaged in
misleading and deceptive conduct and breached obligations of continuous disclosure in respect of its us operations.
a second class action was commenced in the supreme court of victoria on 22 december 2014 by melbourne city
investments pty ltd (mci) on behalf of shareholders who acquired the company’s shares on or after 17 august 2012
and who held those shares on 15 july 2013. this proceeding was commenced following an earlier proceeding
commenced by mci having been permanently stayed by order of the supreme court of victoria as being an abuse
of process, and the high court having refused mci special leave to appeal this decision. mci also alleges in the
december 2014 proceeding that the company misled the market and breached obligations of continuous disclosure
in respect of its us operations. the company made an application to the federal court to stay this second mci
proceeding as also being an abuse of process. on 5 july 2016 justice foster of the federal court granted the
company’s application and ordered the second mci proceeding also be permanently stayed as an abuse of process.
mci has subsequently applied to the federal court to set aside or revoke this permanent stay. the outcome of this
further application is not yet known.
with regard to continuing claims and applications in the federal court, the company strongly denies any and
all allegations made against it and is vigorously defending the proceeding.
no orders have yet been made for class closure or opt out. based on the information currently available, the company
does not know the quantum of either class action. no provision has been recognised at 30 june 2016 in respect
of the claim.

note 27 – business acquisitions
diageo chateau & estates
on 1 january 2016, the company acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of diageo chateau & estates (‘dc&e’),
a company incorporated in the us. this included the acquisition of related assets in the uk. dc&e is a leader
in the us luxury and masstige wine market, being the owner of a collection of iconic wine brands based in napa,
california. additionally, dc&e has a strong market presence in the commercial wine market in the uk.
the cash consideration of $803.8 million was funded by a combination of cash resources generated from the issue
of shares during the period and utilising the group’s debt facilities.
from the date of acquisition, dc&e contributed $200.7 million of revenue and $23.8 million to profit before tax
from continuing operations of the group. revenue and profit from the acquired entities that would have been earned
if the acquisition had occurred at the commencement of the financial year has not been provided on the basis that
the calculation of that information is impracticable. this is because the businesses were fully integrated into the
diageo group and separate comparable financial information relating to the acquired business as a stand-alone entity
is not available. additionally, information relating to the fair value of assets acquired is not available to accurately
determine the purchase price accounting adjustments that would have been recognised had the acquisition taken
place on 1 july 2015. transaction costs of $24.5 million were expensed and are included in administration expenses.
assets acquired and liabilities assumed
the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of dc&e at the date of acquisition were:
                                                                                                           fair value

acquisition of assets
the acquisition method of accounting is used for all asset acquisitions regardless of whether equity instruments
or other assets are acquired.
cost is measured as the fair value of cash, shares issued or liabilities undertaken at the date of acquisition.
costs directly attributable to the acquisition are generally included in the asset’s carrying amount. transaction
costs arising on the issue of equity instruments are recognised directly in equity.
where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amount payable in the future is discounted
to its present value.

key estimate and judgement:

business combinations
business combinations (acquisitions of subsidiaries) are accounted for using the acquisition method. the consideration
transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition
date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners
of the acquiree and the equity issued by the acquirer. acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, and included
in administration expenses.
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with
limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. when the group acquires a business,
it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with
the contractual terms, economic conditions, the group’s operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions
as at the acquisition date. the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill. under the acquisition method, the group has up to 12 months post the acquisition
date to finalise the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities.

independent auditor’s report to the members of treasury wine estates limited
report on the financial report
we have audited the accompanying financial report of treasury wine estates limited (the
company), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 june 2016,
and consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated
statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended on that
date, notes 1 to 33 comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information and the directors’ declaration of the group comprising the company and the entities
it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the financial year.
directors’ responsibility for the financial report
the directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives
a true and fair view in accordance with australian accounting standards and the corporations
act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of the financial report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or
error. in note 1, the directors also state, in accordance with australian accounting standard aasb
101 presentation of financial statements, that the financial statements of the group comply with
international financial reporting standards.

auditor’s responsibility
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. we conducted
our audit in accordance with australian auditing standards. these auditing standards require that
we comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial report is free from material
misstatement.
an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial report. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due
to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant
to the entity’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. an audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
we performed the procedures to assess whether in all material respects the financial report presents
fairly, in accordance with the corporations act 2001 and australian accounting standards, a true
and fair view which is consistent with our understanding of the group’s financial position and of
its performance.
