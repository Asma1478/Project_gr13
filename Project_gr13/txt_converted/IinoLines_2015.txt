    transporting coal by barge at maizuru port, kyoto prefecture. the iino group now operates the
    shipping business, comprising oceangoing shipping and regional shipping operations, and the
    real estate business.

    shipping agency activities and ship equipment sales. the real estate business’ s activities
    include leasing mainly of office building space, building management, warehousing, and studio
    operations. we offer high-quality services, going beyond cargo transport and building leasing,
    by integrating related operations, such as ship management and building management.
    it is our earnest desire to support contemporary life and industry while continuing to contribute
    to society through both our land- and sea-based businesses.

     message from the president

     harnessing our integrated strength to become a “trustworthy global enterprise”

                                               introduction
                                               iino lines celebrates its 116th anniversary this year.
                                               over this long history, we have succeeded in developing
                                               two core businesses — shipping and real estate. the
                                               foundation for success in both operations is maintaining
                                               safety, and as a result of that management philosophy, we
                                               have been able to target consistent, sustainable growth.
                                               our shipping business is a global business, and as such
                                               it reflects the state of the global economy, which is
                                               continuing to grow and increase demand for international
                                               commerce, although the growth these days is mainly led
                                               by emerging countries. because of its close ties to global
                                               market conditions, earnings in the shipping business are
                                               dependent on several highly volatile factors such as fuel
                                               costs, exchange rates, interest rates, international freight
                                               charges, and more. our real estate business, on the
                                               other hand, is a domestic business, mainly centered on
                                               our office lease business in central tokyo. while rental
                                               rates and maintenance costs also fluctuate, this business
                                               is less exposed to the volatility of multiple markets than
                                               shipping, and therefore, it generates relatively stable
                                               profits. over the decades, we have sought to develop
                                               a stable consolidated earnings base by combining the
                                               shipping business, which captures the opportunities
                                               of global growth, with the real estate business, which
                                               delivers reliable income, while at the same time keeping
                                               an eye out for new business opportunities which may arise.
                                               the feature section of this report reviews both our
                                               international business development efforts in the shipping
                                               business and our strategy to develop commercial
                                               properties through our real estate business that will
                                               continue to meet customers’ changing needs.
                                               i believe that anyone who takes a few moments to read
                                               this report will gain a deeper understanding of the iino
                                               group and an appreciation for our unique, investor-
                                               friendly business structure.

                                                q. can you give us a brief overview of your business
                                                    operations for the fiscal year ended march 31,
                                                    2015.
                                               first, we should look back at global economic
                                               developments during that fiscal year, which was marked
                                               by sluggish economic conditions in europe and a
                                               slowdown in china. that was compounded in the second
                                               half of the year by increasing concerns about credit
                                               uncertainty involving several countries, including russia,
                                               due to the sharp decline in crude oil prices. overall,
                                               economic trends were generally flat amid an increasingly
                                               unstable international situation due to escalating tensions
                                               in areas such as the middle east and ukraine. in japan,
                                               the bank of japan introduced a large-scale program of
                                               additional quantitative easing measures that prompted a
                                               rally in share prices and a further depreciation of the yen.

       (solas), which establishes rules for ensuring safety at sea,
       and the international convention for the prevention of
       pollution from ships, 1973 as modified by the protocol of

improve evaluation of “well-thought action” (thinking                                     trainees from overseas with their training completion certificates

       the head office relocation, i am absolutely delighted
       that we chose the iino building.
       the iino building was designed to be a property that
       would continue to earn people's admiration far into
       the next century. sustainability was a major element of
       this concept, and the building ranks in the top echelon
       of prime office space in japan in terms of its advanced
       environmental performance. as a result, it has garnered
       a host of accolades from both domestic and overseas
       organizations for its eco-friendly construction and design,
       including the highly regarded casbee-s certification.
       as tenants, we have been impressed on a daily basis by
       the passion and enthusiasm with which the maintenance
       staff, service managers, security guards, and other
       building services personnel work to ensure that the
       building is kept in first-class condition. i also read in

       been awarded a prize by the environment ministry for the

      iino kaiun kaisha, ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries

     notes to consolidated financial statements


      1. basis of presentation of the consolidated financial statements
      the accompanying consolidated financial statements of iino kaiun kaisha, ltd. (the “company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the
      “companies”) are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in japan. the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared
      by the company as required under the financial instrument exchange law of japan.

      certain items presented in the consolidated financial statements submitted to the director of the kanto finance bureau in japan have been reclassified for the
      convenience of readers outside of japan.


      2. summary of significant accounting policies

      a. basis of consolidation
      the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its 54 significant subsidiaries in 2015 (50 in 2014).

      the other subsidiaries are excluded from consolidation since, in aggregate, the combined total assets, net sales, net income, and retained earnings of these
      subsidiaries do not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the companies.

      for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, all significant intercompany transactions, account balances, and unrealized profits among
      the companies have been eliminated.


      b. equity method
      investments in significant affiliates are accounted for under the equity method as of march 31, 2015 and 2014.

      investments in the remaining 8 non-consolidated subsidiaries and 3 affiliates of the company are stated at cost on march 31, 2015 (12 non-consolidated
      subsidiaries and 4 affiliates on march 31, 2014) since the company’s equity in their net income (loss), on aggregate, does not have a material effect on the
      consolidated financial statements.


      c. fiscal periods of consolidated subsidiaries
      the accounts of the consolidated subsidiaries, except for serpent’s mouth carriers s. a. and 7 other subsidiaries whose fiscal year ends are december 31, are
      prepared as of the same date as the consolidated financial statements. the aforementioned 8 subsidiaries with differing financial years are included in the
      consolidated financial statements based on their accounts as of december 31 (their fiscal year ends), and necessary adjustments for significant transactions
      during the period between their fiscal year ends and the consolidated balance sheet date are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

      one of the company’s subsidiary, serene sea navigation s.a., changed its fiscal period end from march 31 to december 31 in this consolidated fiscal period,
      and the fiscal period of such subsidiary in this consolidated fiscal period is 9 months. such change does not have a material impact on the companies.


      d. foreign currency translation
      all monetary assets and liabilities of the company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into japanese
      yen at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet dates. the foreign exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the statements of
      income to the extent that they are not hedged by forward exchange contracts. revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates of the
      respective periods.


      e. vessel operating revenues and related costs
      vessel operating revenues and related costs are recognised using the percentage-of-completion method, according to the number of days the vessel has
      completed its voyage.


      f. income taxes
      the asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between

     lease assets:
     finance lease transactions that transfer the ownership are capitalized and accounted for as ordinary sales transactions.
