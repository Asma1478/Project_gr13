   6.3. strategy
   management
   soon after the formal adoption of the strategy, a
   dedicated structure was established to coordinate
   the processes of its implementation at the group.
   within its framework, members of the manage‑
   ment board, along with the president, act as
   project sponsors. another tier is the steering com‑
   mittee, composed of the owners of strategic goals.
   the management board’s proxy for the strategy
   is responsible for coordinating and monitoring the
   sustainable development and responsible busi‑
   ness strategy’s implementation at pgnig group
   subsidiaries and branches, as well as for internal
   and external communication of the sustainable de‑
   velopment and responsible business agenda. the
   same role at the level of the group’s branches and
   subsidiaries is performed by regional csr facilita‑
   tors. altogether, there are several dozen employ‑
   ees for whom sustainable development is one of
   their principal duties. the proxy is also responsible
   for monitoring the implementation status of the
   strategic goals and operational objectives, and for
   reporting actions scheduled for a given period to
   the management board.

   it is worth noting that since 2010 the strategic
   goals have been among the criteria used to
   evaluate senior management staff, following their
   inclusion in the annual mbo targets. in this way the
   strategic goals are reflected in the objectives set
   for individual employees and teams.

   since 2010, the group companies have conducted
   their businesses based on their own sustainable
   development and responsible business strategies.



   6.4. about the report
   the pgnig group 2013 best csr practices is a set
   of best practices in the implementation of the
   sustainable development and responsible business
   strategy at the pgnig group.

   tices’ presents our pursuit of the objectives defined

gas from pgnig and money to you’ was organ‑
ised. the objective of the campaign is to reduce
emissions from coal-fired boilers and furnaces in
kraków, mainly by liquidating the sources of such
emissions and replacing them with natural gas as
an environment-friendly fuel.

the principal goal of the campaign is to win new
and encourage existing customers to change their
energy carriers and use natural gas for heating
purposes, which will result in lower emissions
from coal-fired boilers and furnaces and increased
natural gas consumption. each customer who takes
advantage of this special offer will receive pln

tariff w-3, respectively).

the project was aimed at enhancing security in the
local community by preventing illegal abstrac‑

included gas customers, the local community, and
the police. the following measures were imple‑
mented: regular meetings with representatives
of the provincial police headquarters, training
on gas theft for county police departments, and
publication of articles on gas theft in the ‘dylematy

police. one of the noteworthy effects of the project
is gas theft prevention.

the goal of the project was to discover and foster
young talents. beneficiaries of the project included
children of pgnig termika employees and of
inhabitants of warsaw. the project included ‘the
heat story’ competition held in the spring of 2013
and addressed to children of the company’s em‑
ployees, who were asked to write a creative story
about heat. winners were announced on children’s
day at teatr rampa. the winning story was turned
into a script of a theatre play, which was later
staged featuring children actors (who first partici‑
pated in a theatre workshop). the play premiered
in december at the finale of the 3rd edition of the
‘fairytale theatre festival’ campaign at the palace
of culture and science. an educational documen‑
tary ‘how heat is produced’ was also shot.

ficiency of the team’s work.

for instance, drawing on the pgnig code of ethics,
the team has developed the code of responsible
gas and oil production, which sets out our vision of
how we want to go about this process.

we also wanted experts in drilling, geology and
environmental protection, and not merely ‘spin
doctors’, to take part in meetings and share their
knowledge with local communities. this is why
the entire communication team attended training
sessions where we learned how to listen and com‑
municate effectively, as well as the role of body
language. now, we hold weekly meetings at which
we exchange information and discuss various
issues. we have thus developed into a tightly‑
knit team, working together to implement one of
pgnig’s major pr projects.

all our communication efforts are designed to:
• provide target audiences with extensive
  information on shale gas production, reliably
  and transparently communicate the details of
  planned projects, and correct untrue informa‑
  tion about unconventional gas,
• show the advantages and benefits that may
  arise from launching projects in particular
  locations,
• conduct and promote two‑way communication
  with local communities.

geophysical and drilling service providers, but also
the security firms we work with. drawing on our
code of ethics, we have developed the code of
responsible gas and oil production, and we expect
all companies involved in the process to adhere to
its provisions. we are well aware that this is a con‑
stant learning process. by no means do we claim
absolute knowledge on how certain things should
be done − we keep on learning, also from our
people in the field. we must also remember there
are a number of misconceptions about shale gas,
which are persuasive enough to capture people’s
imagination and stir their fears. this is why it is so
important to approach the feelings and attitudes
of everyone involved in or affected by our jointly
implemented projects with patience and respect.

in june 2013, a charity collection among staff
members of the carpathian trading division was
organised for the benefit of single mother shelters in
kraków and tarnów. the purpose of the charity event
was to collect in-kind donations and raise funds to fi‑
nance the purchase of essential items and equipment.
the donated or purchased items were presented to
the shelters by the representatives of the carpathian
trading division before christmas. before the charity
collection was launched, the shelters were first asked
to specify their most urgent needs and requirements.
the purchases financed with the collection proceeds
were also made based on earlier consultations with
the shelters, so they received exactly the supplies
they needed most. the collected stocks of essential
items were sufficient to cover the operating needs of
the shelters for at least several months.

the project’s objective was to educate pre-
schoolers on safety issues. pgnig has been a
partner of the project for several years now (also
in 2013). the project is organised in cooperation
with the prevention division of the municipal police
department in poznań. as part of the initiative,
meetings and educational demonstrations are held
in pre-schools to encourage safe behaviour on the
way to/from school, to teach children how to play
safely at school, outdoors or at home, and to famil‑
iarise them with the most common road signs. the
guests invited are usually members of the police
force, firefighters or representatives of programme
partners, such as pgnig. an important objective of
the programme is to win children’s trust and help
them acquire the confidence to ask parents and
tutors for help.

various environmental projects are also imple‑

individual group companies, many of which have
contributed over the years to reduced atmospheric
emissions, improved safety of land, soil and
groundwater, and reduced amount of generated
waste. they include projects to replace old pipe‑
lines, purchase advanced drilling equipment, feed
gas into pipelines in an emission-free way, pur‑

pgnig’s ‘responsible energy 2013’ report was prepared primarily
on the basis of the reporting indicators of the global reporting
initiative, which is an independent stakeholder network with a
mission to develop and popularise unified guidelines for economic,
environmental, and social performance reporting worldwide. this
enables objective comparisons of csr activities pursued by various
companies. besides principles and guidance, the gri guidelines contain
a system of indicators that companies may opt-in to include in their
reporting.
