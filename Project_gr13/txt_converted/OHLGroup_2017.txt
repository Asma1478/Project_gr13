4   letter from the chairman




                                                         letter from the
                                                         chairman

               ladies and gentlemen,

               2016 has been a financial year of poor results for the ohl group, strongly
               influenced by the impact of the full recognition of the losses in a number of
               older projects (referred to internally as legacy projects) and by the adverse
               exchange rate trend in the currencies of the countries in which the group
               carries out its business activity.

               on the operating level, the income statement has been influenced to a large
               extent by both factors, which have led to losses amounting to 432 million euros.
               the normalized income statement, without taking into account the influence of
               the results expected from these older projects and at a constant exchange rate,
               would have shown a net profit of 248 million euros, four times more than the
               profit obtained in 2015, which totaled 57 million euros.

               despite these adverse results and following the measures taken in the financial
               sphere, the 2016 financial year has left a sound and reinforced balance sheet
               that constitutes a solid base on which to build the company’s future.

               in this context, regaining the confidence of our rating agencies has been
               established as a priority objective for ohl in 2017. the group trusts that
               the debt-reduction measures taken, the sound and profitable model of the
               construction business –once the impact of the older projects has been absorbed–
               and the strength of the liquidity position –following the agreement with ohl’s
               reference banks-, will make it possible to reach a recourse leveraging ratio at
               the end of 2017 of less than 1, an aspect which is expected to bring about a
               positive impact on the rating.

                                                                    letter from the chairman   5

principal milestones of the financial year in economic terms

•   final elimination of the impact of the legacy projects on the results and
    the curtailing of their impact on the cash flow. at the close of accounts
    for the year, a revision of the final targets for these projects was made that
    has translated into lower figures for ebitda and for the result of entities
    accounted for by the equity method totaling 520 million and 149 million
    euros, respectively. with this situation resolved, ohl will be able to center
    on the management of the rest of the construction business, now on sound
    footing and producing a positive cash flow on a sustainable basis.

•   successful rotation of assets with capital gains in all cases. that activity,
    which is a part of the company’s ordinary course of business, has enabled
    debt reduction and the simplification of ohl’s financial structure. this
    rotation has involved divestitures totaling 1.6 billion euros in 2016 and
    627 million in the first two months of 2017 and has led to a net result of
    330 million euros in 2016. moreover, in the first two months of 2017, an
    additional amount of approximately 100 million euros has been obtained
    following the recent divestiture of the 2.5% stake in abertis and the partial
    divestiture of the mayakoba and canalejas assets.

•   excellent performance of the concessions division, where sales and
    ebitda from tolls, at a constant exchange rate and excluding the effect
    of the change in the consolidation method of metro ligero oeste, grew
    11.7% and 20.5% respectively, and where the concessions in mexico, with
    growth figures in local currency of 14.7% and 14.8%, respectively, stand
    out particularly.

    the division has initiated a process for incorporating new partners during
    this financial year, up to a total of 49%, into its greenfield assets: vespucio
    oriente, puente industrial, río magdalena, nogales-puchuncaví and
    puerto valparaíso. this incorporation would cut the equity contributions
    by approximately half and, according to current estimates, these would then
    be reduced to 146 million euros, delivering a cash inflow of approximately
    116 million euros, corresponding to the proportionate part of the equity
    already contributed to these projects at the close of accounts for 2016.

•   complete elimination of trigger risk. following the sale of the 4.425%
    stake in abertis on october 3, 2016, the process was completed for the
    elimination of all of the borrowings with trigger risk which, at the start of
    2015, totaled 1.5 billion euros.




                                                the ohl group maintains
                                                  a public and voluntary
                                               commitment to sustainable
                                                 development promoted
                                                 by its board of directors

6   letter from the chairman




               •   backing of the group by the banking sector. caixabank, banco sabadell,
                   bankia, santander, popular, société générale and crédit agricole, following
                   a detailed study of the present and future situation of ohl, have decided to
                   maintain their positions and to commit a package of additional financing in
                   a total amount of 747 million euros. this transaction confirms the support
                   of these institutions to the business plan designed by the company, which
                   in 2016 has had to confront high volatility in the markets caused basically
                   by the rating agency downgrades.

               •   an investor day was held on april 5, 2017, during which the current
                   situation of the company and of the market was addressed. ohl will
                   reinforce its presence in its eight home markets and will give priority to the
                   return-risk ratio over the growth target in works completed, in addition to
                   reinforcing the risk control and contract management mechanisms in the
                   tendering and performance stages.


               sustainable development

               in 2003, the ohl group stated its public and voluntary commitment to
               sustainable development. this is a firm commitment that is driven by its
               board of directors through the audit, compliance and corporate social
               responsibility committee.

               as significant events during the financial year in this scope, i would like to
               highlight the following:

               •   the drawing-up of the group’s human rights policy.

               •   review and updating of the corporate sustainability policies within simple,
                   clear and effective regulatory frameworks that are known and applied
                   systematically in all of the business activities and geographical areas in
                   which the group operates.

               •   implementation of 44% of the measures included up to 2020 in the
                   group’s csr strategic plan 2015-2020. major objectives of the plan,
                   which is aligned with the united nations sustainable development goals,
                   are to strengthen ohl’s contribution to sustainable development and to
                   succeed in having its csr actions become a factor of competitiveness for
                   the business lines.

               •   continued presence on the ftse4good ibex since 2008. this sustainability
                   index ranks us as a committed security and of particular interest to investors
                   who combine their profitability targets with their concern for ethical, social,
                   environmental and good governance aspects in business management.

               •   maximum “a” score (formerly, 100a), with leader status in the cdp
                   climate change 2016, and renewal of the group’s presence on the climate
                   a list, a list made up by only 9% of the companies with the highest scores
                   in the world in the fight against climate change.

                                                                  letter from the chairman   7



•   the ohl group is placed twelfth in the ranking of european construction
    companies and seventeenth among spanish companies in all sectors,
    within the top 1,000 european companies that invest most in r&d&i,
    according to the document eu industrial r&d investment scoreboard
    2015, published yearly by the european commission.

and to conclude, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to convey to you that, in
this new stage commencing under my chairmanship, ohl has established a
solid foundation on which to consolidate a promising future for the group that
will be achieved, without a doubt, thanks to the support and confidence of all
of our shareholders as well as of our stakeholders. and most especially i wish
to thank ohl’s outstanding team for their generosity, in singularly difficult
and painful circumstances for all of us, and because their effort, dedication and
unfailing spirit of achievement will continue to be essential for the attainment
of the targets we have set for ourselves in 2017. i wish to thank all of you most
sincerely, in my own name and in that of the board of directors.

60   strategy and business model


                owens lake
                the owens lake contract, awarded by the los angeles department of water and
                power (ladwp), is the largest project obtained by the ohl group in california to
                date. the scope of the contract encompasses the second-to-last phase of the project
                designed to mitigate the dust emissions from owens lake, which extends over an area
                of 938 hectares of the lake playa and is located at a distance of 160 kilometers from
                the city of los angeles.




                at the start of the 20th century, the city of los angeles acquired the majority of the
                water rights in the owens valley for the purpose of building the los angeles aqueduct.
                the water from owens lake was diverted to the aqueduct and, as a result, the lake
                dried up in 1926. the desiccation of the lake gave rise to the crystallization of the
                minerals and salts, generating a crust of alkaline salt that still today covers a large part
                of the lake bed. the effects of the heavy winds on this saline crust have given rise to a
                source of dust and air pollution in the area, causing a serious public health problem
                and a strong ecological impact.

                the ladwp has undertaken a number of measures to mitigate this impact, and the
                contract awarded to ohl na covers the second-to-last phase of the global project
                planned for attenuating the dust emissions. the scope of the project includes the
                movement of millions of tons of rock and the installation of an automatic watering
                system along the lake bed.

                to date, 95% of the dust emissions have already been reduced achieving a positive
                impact on the quality of life of the communities in the area.

                from the ecological perspective, owens lake has been an important nesting area for
                many birds, and one of the benefits of the ponds and areas of vegetation generated is
                that birds are returning to the lake to breed. the lake is an important stopover for
                hundreds of species of birds and, now that there are more insects, the birds can return.
                the audubon society has designated owens lake as an important area for bird

mexico-toluca inter-city train
the mexico-toluca inter-city train is a medium-distance and medium-speed
railway project under construction that will connect the metropolitan area of
the toluca valley, state of mexico, to the western area of mexico city.




the train, which will cover a distance of 58 kilometers in 39 minutes, will
enable the daily carriage of around 230,000 passengers and, in addition, once
its operation has commenced, will prevent the emission of more than 28,000
tons of carbon dioxide.

ohl’s mexican subsidiary, constructora de proyectos viales de méxico, s.a.
(cpvm), participates in the project, which consists of the construction of a
section of approximately 36 km of double-track, designed to reach a maximum
speed of 160 km/h. the section includes 32 km of viaduct and will have four
elevated stations 200 m in length.

cpmv has implemented environmental offsetting measures such as the creation
of programs for reforestation and the relocation of local animal species. with
these measures, not only are potential environmental impacts prevented, but
also favorable conditions are generated for the integration of green spaces.

forestry offsets

as part of the program, 1,500 trees of the pinus hartwegii species have been
planted, with an average height of from 60 to 80 cm in optimum morphological,
physiological and health conditions, and in appropriate tree planting bags to
ensure the survival of the specimens during the dry season.

the reforestation operations were performed in the town of ocoyoacac, state
of mexico, in the “los pocitos” and “la mina” areas, located in los ejidos de
santa maría la asunción, tepexoyuca. so far, an area as large as 22 hectares
is already under continuous maintenance.

relocation of local animal species

the wildlife rescue and relocation program is being implemented for the care
of animal species and is focused principally for the protection of the species in
accordance with the nom-059-semarnat-2010 standard. the program
includes the assessment and identification of the spaces, to determine the best site
for the species to be relocated. as a result, from the start of the project up to the
present time, more than 4,200 specimens of amphibians, reptiles, birds and
mammals have already been relocated. at the same time, the environment
department has undertaken a number of campaigns designed to raise awareness
and to teach the local communities about the care of the species native to the
area.

cement plant in colombia
the maturity of the bim 3d system

ohl industrial has been awarded a turnkey project for a cement production
plant in sonsón, province of antioquia, in colombia, worth 225 million. this
is a key project for the development of the country.

the bim methodology, now mature at ohl industrial, has been present since
the bidding phase when a 3d model was generated that served for making the
estimates necessary for performing the technical and economic valuations. the
model was also used for preparing a commercial video for the presentation of
the tender to the client.




scope of bim implementation at industrial.

the integration of the various elements is being performed in the design phase,
beginning with the surveying and geotechnics, the design of earthworks and
roads, buildings, conveyor belts, among others. in the case of the elements
whose design has to be outsourced, for example the “pyroprocessing”, these
are also integrated into the system. this contributes to considerably improving
and streamlining coordination in the entire team involved in the preparation of
the project.

one of the major successes already achieved is that the great majority of the
drawings are extracted from the 3d models, with the result that there is a full
guarantee that what is modeled will appear in the same way on the drawings,
thereby eliminating errors in coordinates, elevations, heights and labels.

moreover, and with the ongoing objective of improving and optimizing
processes, the intention in this project is to take several additional steps towards
the implementation of a complete bim model. the first step in that direction
consists of the incorporation into the model of the fourth dimension, 4d, that
is, time. the 5d model -cost control- has also been initiated with the extraction
of part of the measurements from the models, and plans are for advancing as
far as 7d.

                 mostly of urban and organic waste, due to the operations for infrastructure
                 maintenance and to the services provided.

                 in terms of management, the construction and demolition waste (cdw) presents
                 a high percentage of recovery (30%) in comparison to deposit. there is little scope
                 for improving this percentage because of the difficulty in locating cost-efficient
                 alternative uses in the vicinity of the works. the rest of the non-hazardous waste is
                 managed for the most part by recycling and reuse, thanks to the development of a
                 market for by-products.                                                                 >>>

         water consumption in 2016 increased 13% with respect to 2015, due to the start
         of plant maintenance contracts in the industrial division and the construction
         projects in australia. this increase in consumption has taken place in reused or
         recycled water, thereby reducing the impact on the extraction of the resource in
         the immediate environment. with the drawing-up of the water scarcity footprint
         protocol, the discharges are calculated with the urban waste water as well as with
         the water from the water table, which is the reason why a year-on-year comparison
         is not feasible.

                 outcomes 2016

                 the consumption of direct and indirect energy has been reduced with respect to
                 2015 by 11.2% and 2.9%, respectively, associated with the decline in activity.

                 the trend of the group in terms of the sources of energy consumed is toward the
                 reduction of the use of fossil fuels in favor of electricity. moreover, in 2016, the
                 use of electricity with a 100% renewable energy guarantee of origin totaled close
                 to 15000 gj, in line with the principles of sustainable procurement.

                 in addition, the group generated and consumed slightly more than 7000 gj of
                 energy from the sun in its concessions during 2016. the decline in activity and in
                 consumption has resulted in a reduction in direct ghg emissions of 13% (almost
                 25,000 tco2e) in comparison to 2015, while reducing the indirect emissions from
                 the consumption of electricity by 3%. scope 3 increased 20.6% with respect
                 to 2015, due to the start of operations of several concessions in colombia and
                 mexico.

                 the construction business generated more than 75% of the scope 1+2 emissions
                 stemming from its energy demand, while 78% of scope 3 was associated with the
                 activities of the concessions division, owing to the use of the infrastructures under
                 concession.

                 in 2016, 3,075 tco2e were offset in the u.s., spain, mexico, chile, colombia and
                 peru. the tons offset by the group since 2011 total more than 10,000 t.

                 the emissions of other pollutants to the air (nox, sox, cov and pm) have
                 been reduced by 10.7% with respect to 2015, consistent with the lower fuel
                 consumption.

                 in 2016, ohl has worked in adjacent areas or has been located in 39 protected
                 areas or non-protected areas with high biodiversity value. the main impacts are on
                 water resources, the coastal environment, the ecosystems and the preexisting plant
                 and animal life. the impacts are controlled by means of measurement plans and
                 through offsetting actions, included in the environmental impact assessment.

                 in the context of biodiversity and as a result of the occupation of the land by its
                 operations, the group has developed soil protection measures on a surface of
                 1,062 ha and has performed the environmental restoration of 4,111 ha.
