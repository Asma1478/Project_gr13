     of the company:

     • working with relatives, duties and operations outside the company, personal investments
     and private relations with suppliers might cause conflict of interest in all areas, including
     recruitment.

     • as a general rule, we avoid conflict of interests. if unavoidable, such cases should be
     managed with utmost care. in this process, the fundamental issue is “full disclosure”. full
     disclosure allows for a healthy investigation. a process that seems suspicious may turn out to
     be harmless to the company.


     • we do not engage in any personal relations based on debts with people who are directly
     or indirectly related to our duty. we do not seek personal interest in such people and
     institutions, nor do we accept any interests offered. we avoid any actions to achieve interests
     for ourselves or our relatives by using the name, resources, reputation of the company and
     our position. we do not abuse the professional information we have for our own benefit or
     that of our relatives.

          strategic sustainability issues
          as the leading chemicals producer of turkey, ak-kim makes 5-year strategic plans in line
          with the mission and vision to ensure continuity of growth. accordingly, we identified our
          sustainability strategies in the reporting period and held a workshop to draw our roadmap.

          led by our general manager, all directors of related departments participated in the
          sustainability workshop. thus, appropriate sustainability practices and areas to be improved
          were identified.

          in addition to identifying our key stakeholders, we also evaluated an extensive list of issues
          influencing our company and stakeholders by using internationally recognized guidelines.
          strategically material issues for our company were examined and prioritized in three groups:
          economic, environmental and social. as a result, we created the ak-kim materiality matrix.

                                local employment and supply practices
                                the word “local” has two meanings for ak-kim: the cities that our company operates in, in
                                terms of employment and the within borders of turkey in terms of where we supply our raw
                                materials from.
                                even though ak-kim does not have a specially designed local employment procedure, we
                                prefer to contribute to local economies by employing people directly from the regions we
                                operate in.
                                ak-kim purchases 50% of its raw and other materials from local suppliers and continues to
                                seek alternative local suppliers to increase the ratio. in terms of contribution to the turkish
                                economy, we find that this ratio is significant in our industry.

     efficient use of raw materials
     employee opinion
     according to our sustainability survey, 62% of our employees say:
     “measures and practices of ak-kim for efficient use of raw materials in
     production processes are satisfactory”.


                                                                                                       our environmental performance
     ak-kim performs all production operations in its integrated production facilities. in other
     words, outputs of a facility are used as raw material in another facility. this brings us a
     considerable advantage in costs and competition. for instance, we not only produce and sell
     hydrogen peroxide, but also use it as a raw material in another facility (sodium percarbonate).
     similarly, we produce and sell methylamines but we also produce dimethylformamide by
     using these methylamines.

     there are more than 20 facilities within ak-kim and all of these facilities have become
     operational under the leadership of ak-kim’s engineering team. ak-kim has been exporting
     its know-how and technologies to foreign companies since 2002. we also have a process
     development unit that benefits from the robust engineering infrastructure and team of
     ak-kim. thanks to this unit, we monitor efficiency of facilities, make improvements where
     required and increase efficiency of raw materials. with the changes made in processes, the
     amount of scrap used in ferric iii chloride production increased. this sets a good example for
     both the efficient use of raw materials and the reuse of waste materials.

     ak-kim facilities also monitor raw material consumption with process control devices and
     improve processes when necessary.

     raw materials and products are properly stored and checked regularly for shelf life thanks
     to the computer-based storage management system. based upon the “first in first out”
     principle, these storage center practices reduce the loss of raw materials.

     among practices to involve employees in the resource use processes are including raw
     material efficiency into individual production goals, training staff on raw material efficiency
     and giving instructions to improve raw material efficiency.

     vehicles licensed by the ministry of environment and urbanization.

     ak-kim has a variety of projects to reduce wastes. for instance, r&d activities seek to
     ensure that activated alumina wastes used in hydrogen peroxide production are used in the
     ceramic industry as a raw material or as a concrete admixture. when this project succeeds,
     activated alumina wastes amounting to approximately 200 tons/year will be recovered.

     in addition, personal scorecards of employees include targets for reducing wastes.

     as a result of all these efforts, approximately 265 tons of hazardous wastes and 550 tons
     of non-hazardous wastes were discharged at ak-kim facilities in 2013. furthermore, 115
     tons of packaging wastes (nylon and paper) and 310 tons of contaminated packaging wastes
     (galvanize and plastic barrels, ibc tanks) were recovered.

     system to avoid any environmental damage. 1,750 tons/year steam power is generated
     during the incineration and this energy is used for the heating of corporate facilities.

     air quality distribution modeling aims to identify how the polluters generated during our
     operations (dust, co, nox, sox, voc, etc.) may be dispersed in the working area under
     existing meteorological conditions and what may be the potential ground level precipitation
     of such pollutants.

     during air pollution distribution modeling, the distribution of air pollutants in the atmosphere
     are mathematically simulated by using parameters such as source data, meteorological data,
     land forms, etc. related computer programs analyze mathematical equalities and algorithms
     of pollutants. ak-kim performs these practices within the coordination of management
     systems.

     with a variety of emission measurement devices, ak-kim makes internal measurements in
     emergencies or pre-defined periods and thus prevents environmental pollution by timely
     intervention in case of any problems.

     in addition, ak-kim actively participates in and contributes to activities of related non-
     governmental platforms, public institutions and business.

     ak-kim has adopted the vision of “offering tailor-made integrated solutions to its customers”.
     one of the important aspects in its r&d practices is enabling customers to save resources by
     improving processes through environment-friendly chemicals. other environment-friendly
     chemicals developed at ak-kim r&d center and offered to customers are listed below.


     • adblue - turns nitrogen oxide gases within the exhaust into nitrogen and water vapor.           our social performance
     prevents emission of nitrogen oxides that harm the environment.

     • akar speed – created as an alternative to conventional methods, this product has a longer-
     lasting effect for defrosting of ice on roads and ensures minimum corrosion of the asphalt.

     • akbleach sld – bleaching processes in the textile industry requires high temperatures.
     this product performs bleaching in low temperatures and thus saves 25-35% energy.

     • akef ant 550 – silicon-based antimicrobial finishing; no effects on the nature during use
     and in time.

     • akua san 7391 – used in the recovery of wastewater in advanced treatment systems
     thanks to its antiscalant features.

     • akwash sr – water is the most wasted resource in textile facilities. to remove extra dye,
     fabric is washed 6-8 times in the post-reactive dyeing process. superior washing performance
     of this product reduces the number of washes and thus achieves water saving.

     • ferric iii chloride - used for sedimentation in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment.

     • polyaluminium chloride - used for sedimentation in drinking water and wastewater
     treatment. thus, it prevents hazardous wastes from polluting the environment.

     • sodium hypochloride - used as a disinfectant in water and wastewater treatment. this
     chemical plays an important role in resource use.


     another project that may be given as an example to our environment-friendly products is
     the capillary membrane system. still in the development phase, this system aims to produce
     capillary synthetic membrane and membrane modules used in wastewater and fresh water
     treatment. due to the increase in population, urbanization and rapid growth of industrial
     practices, access to water and recovery of wastewater is gaining importance. this project
     is expected to contribute positively to the national current deficit and serve environmental
     strategies in turkey.
