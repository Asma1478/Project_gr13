the road to sustainability is fraught with obstacles - some have to be overcome with innovation, some with determination, and some simply by
perseverance. but as we overcome each obstacle, we come across doors of opportunities with multiple outcomes that take us to the next level. this
thought is graphically represented in this design theme. the upward moving transverse lines represent the group's ambitions. the pillars of myriad colours
are the roadmaps of individual businesses. while the ones in red are symbolic of mahindra's rise for good philosophy that continues to guide them all.

businesswise is the next phase in our sustainability
journey. in it, every individual business is driving the sustainability
agenda on issues material to their stakeholders and aiming to set
new benchmarks within their sector and geographies. it is like
pursuing the sustainability agenda with independent teams who
are not only committed but capable and experienced. this
enlarged team, new vigour, focus and greater ownership has
created a multiplier effect that aims to transcend incremental
growth and give rise to a transformational change. and it has
begun to yield accelerated results in the very rst year.

materiality
in our dynamic and fast-paced world, externalities and
expectations are constantly evolving. to keep our focus on
sustainability issues that are important and warrant focussed
attention, as they could have signiﬁcant impact on the
organisation or our stakeholders, we periodically evaluate our
material issues.

materiality, for us, is the compass that provides direction to our

per gri g3.1 guidelines and aa 1000 accountability principles standard:

 materiality
  mahindra has adopted a structured methodology for materiality assessment, followed by creation of measurable
  performance indicators for prioritised material issues. the report presents the sustainability roadmaps with deﬁned goals
  and targets. the stakeholder engagement outcome can be utilised as a key input to the development of sustainability
  roadmap by all sectors.


 stakeholder inclusiveness
  the report fairly presents the various stakeholder engagement initiatives conducted during the reporting period.



                                                                                                                               06

 responsiveness
   the organisation responds to the stakeholder concerns through policies, procedures and governance systems aligned to
   material issues.


 reliability
   the collection and collation process for sustainability data and information at mahindra is partly through an online portal
   and partly through manual worksheets. the systems deployed for collection, collation and analysis of sustainability data
   and information were reviewed at the site and sector level for the ﬁrst three quarters of the ﬁnancial year 2014-15 and at
   the corporate level for all four quarters of the ﬁnancial year 2014-15. overall, the sustainability data and information
   presented in the report are reliable.

sustainability and us




                overview
                'alternative thinking' has been the driving force of our sustainability journey. it is
                directing us to think big but act lean, get ahead but give back, market globally but
                manufacture locally and target high proﬁts but in harmony with a higher purpose.

                over the years, we have travelled a signiﬁcant distance. we have been taking the
                lead and big leaps in sunshine areas, traversing alternative routes, ﬁnding rooms for
                improvement in seemingly perfect solutions and adding sustainable possibilities in
                our bouquet of offerings.

                a native language of mahindras business narrative, today we almost subconsciously
                sieve our strategies, actions and policies through the triple bottom line ﬁlter.




                the essence of sustainability resides in the very core
                purpose of mahindra "we will challenge conventional
                thinking and innovatively use all our resources to
                drive positive change in the lives of our
                stakeholders and communities across the world, to
                enable them to rise."




                                                                                                         28

sustainability structure
sustainability at mahindra is governed by a top-down approach enabling strategic vision and action plan to not just steer grass-
roots interventions, but also monitor its effectiveness and disclose it transparently.

behind and companies have channelised efforts to overcome the barriers and catch up with the targets.

stakeholder engagement
if sustainability is about ensuring value addition and long-term
proﬁtability while simultaneously managing and minimising
negative social and environmental impacts of business, then
stakeholder engagement is one of the key activities that enables
this to happen successfully and effectively.

at mahindra, we believe that forging strong and dynamic channels of
communication with our stakeholders is mutually beneﬁcial at
multiple levels. it helps us plan our short- and long-term
strategies better, identify scope for a new product or service
and enhance the performance of existing products. at
the same time, our stakeholders become part of
our overall growth vision, understand our
decisions much better and support
our endeavours more fervently.




                                           whether it is a customer or an investor, a dealer or a
                                           supplier, an employee or a local community, we make it a
                                           point to address and listen to every stakeholder.




                                           group-wide stakeholder engagement
                                           mechanisms:
                                           as the mediums change, so must our modes of engagement. we evolve our
                                           engagement modules to be in sync with the changing times.

employees
at mahindra, we believe that only a well-engaged employee can be consistently productive. not only does consistent engagement
lead to better alignment with corporate goals, it also helps gauge employee needs and wants. employees being privy to internal
systems and decision-making processes, are also a rich source of insights to improve organisational processes and policies.


we provide ample platforms for active dialogues with employees.

health & safety
the ﬁrst step to create a great workplace is to foster a safe working condition
for the employees. rigorous safety procedures are in place at all
mahindra locations which are continuously improved year-on-year.

despite our efforts in making our organisation injury free,
we still face unfortunate incidences of fatalities and
accidents. five fatalities were reported in the
reporting period.

the green route to taj mahal
mahindra launched an electric vehicle pilot project, under the aegis of the
government of india's ambitious national electric mobility mission plan
(nemmp). as part of the project, four battery-powered maxximo electric vans
were handed over to the agra development authority, which will be used along
the clean, green taj zero emission corridor, to help reduce vehicular emissions.

this initiative by mahindra is the ﬁrst such project under the central government's
nemmp. developed by mahindra reva, a pioneer of electric vehicle (ev)
technologies, the four maximmo electric vans will initially be used to ferry
tourists from shilpgram to the east gate of the taj mahal. mahindra will also
provide charging stations, technical assistance, spare parts and additional service
support for this project.

india's rst crde tractor
we introduced crde technology, which is usually present in an
automobile, in tractors. the crde technology is a modular,
electronically controlled diesel fuel injection system, which offers
high performance over varying load ranges and provides a better
driving experience due to lower engine noise.

with the crde technology, the new arjun 605 mat, which is
india's ﬁrst multi-application tractor, offers better fuel efﬁciency
and enhanced performance in agri-applications as well as haulage.

economic performance




                                                                overview
                                            fy 2015 was a year that began with a lot of hope in india. a new government
                                       had just come into power and was expected to shake policies and
                                decision-making processes out of limbo. but it takes time for hope to turn into reality
                           and till that time, one needs to continue having faith in it. although indias economy grew
                      by 7.3 percent during fy 2015, growth hastened slowly, constrained by weak demand at
                  home and abroad.

         against the backdrop of such an economic condition and subdued consumer interest, mahindra group saw a
    minor blip in its ﬁnancial performance in fy 2015. the consolidated gross revenues and other income for the group
    was inr 760.15 billion as against inr 787.36 billion in the previous year. the consolidated proﬁt after tax, after
    deducting minority interests, stood at inr 313.7 billion as compared to inr 466.7 billion in the previous year. similar
    performance was seen in auto and farm sectors as well, which is usually our biggest revenue contributor.

    automotive division saw de-growth in sales across all major segments. passenger vehicles including uvs, mpvs and
    cars saw an 11.9% decrease in volumes due to the increasing preference for new launches, petrol engines and
                    compact uvs. yet we continued leadership of the domestic uv market by posting a market share of
                                37.4%. bolero retained the title of being india's largest selling suv for the 9th
                                consecutive year and became the 5th highest selling passenger vehicle in india.
                                sales of commercial vehicles also came down by 4.8% due to slowdown in agricultural
                                income and ﬁnance availability.

                                   similarly farm division (including swaraj division) recorded sales of 234,766 tractors, a
                                   decrease of 12.6% over last year. this mirrors the overall decline of 13% in sales for
                                   the indian tractor industry in fy 2015. that said, we still command a leadership
                                   position with a market share of 40%. the business performance did not dampen our
                                   efforts of promoting technology and innovation in our products.




                                   we introduced arjun novo, the rst
                                   tractor model to roll out of the all-new

                                   comfort and ergonomics.


                                   meanwhile, our group companies continued to forge ahead on the road to
                                   prosperity. mahindra lifespace developers ltd. posted a consolidated total income
                                   and pat (pre-minority interest) of inr 11.48 billion and inr 2.83 billion respectively -
                                   an increase of 52% in the former and a highly satisfying 157% increase in the latter.
                                   mahindra & mahindra financial services ltd. also reported a 14% increase in its
                                   consolidated income and also expanded its network to 1,108 ofﬁces in 26 states and 5

our ﬁnancial performance in fy 2015 however had no bearing on the general
                                                                                          during the reporting

                                          mtwl acquires 51% stake in peugeot scooters

                                          over the past few years, mahindra has strengthened its position in the two-wheeler
                                          segment globally. in january 2015, the global ambitions of mahindra group received
                                          a tremendous shot in the arm when mahindra two wheelers ltd. (mtwl) completed
                                          all the necessary formalities for acquiring 51% stake in peugeot motocycles (pmtc),
                                          part of the euro 54 billion psa group based in france.

                                          pmtc (a.k.a. peugeot scooters), a key player in urban mobility in europe for 116 years,
                                          is the oldest motorised two-wheeler manufacturer in the world. it offers one of the
                                          most comprehensive range of scooters and mopeds, from 50cc to 400cc, including the
                                          successful three-wheeled scooter metropolis in the european market.

                                          the coming together of mahindra and peugeot is expected to beneﬁt the
                                          two-wheeler businesses of both companies. mahindra offers access to the india
                                          market, mass market product technology and competence in marketing while peugeot
                                          brings premium range, a strong european footprint and a globally recognised brand.




this partnership would enable both mtwl and pmtc to speed their international
expansion by driving synergies and leveraging respective strengths of both parties.

local supply
in recent years, we have been steadfast towards achieving our global ambitions. but while we have trained our vision to foreign
shores, our intention to localise our production and operation remains strong as ever. although the boundaries of india remain
the de facto deﬁnition of local supply, some businesses have their own deﬁnition and boundary of what constitutes as local.
this is based on its industry requirements and other on-ground realities like access to technology and know-how, tax and duty
regimes, and supply of skilled manpower. but the objective remains to promote local talent and give it an opportunity to ﬂourish
on a larger scale.

that said, we have exacting quality standards and stringent processes to identify and empanel our suppliers. some of the factors
inﬂuencing supplier selection include:

environmental performance




                                      overview
                          during the reporting period, we progressed well on our environmental
                    agenda. notable milestones include turning water positive as a group and
               mahindra lifespaces conducting a natural capital proﬁling - a ﬁrst in the group.

               while we marched ahead to achieve our big goals faster and sooner, we kept a
               sharp focus on introspective small steps that eliminated roadblocks and helped
               lay the foundation for big impacts. this resulted in enhanced environmental
               performance in areas of energy conservation, water reduction and waste
               management across the group.



               we embarked on new initiatives across our value chain to
               ensure that we created better value for our customers
               and our stakeholders while growing our business.



              management approach
               our approach to environment management stems from our core purpose to drive
               positive change in the lives of our stakeholders and enable them to rise. it is rooted
               in our belief that only businesses that embrace sustainability and environment
               efﬁciency will generate long-term value for their stakeholders.

               thus environmental efﬁciency is central to all our processes, products and premises.
               we are committed to make a positive difference across our entire product lifecycle.
               from green manufacturing facilities to imbibing green consciousness in our people,
               our approach to environmental sustainability covers all the high-impact material
               issues across our businesses.




               we consistently raise the bar and set ourselves ambitious
               targets and goals. we leverage alternative thinking to
               unleash new ideas to achieve these goals.


                                                                                                        83

                                          three places witnessed presentations on sustainable operational practices as well
                                          as a dialogue session.

                                          suppliers gained knowledge on various sustainability aspects such as energy
                                          conservation, water efﬁciency, waste management, use of alternate energy, local
                                          sourcing, operational safety and biodiversity. mldl's sustainability roadmap
                                          2020 was also shared during the meetings.

                                          all three meets saw an overwhelming response with around 65+ individuals from
                                          50 companies in the west zone, 50+ individuals from 35 companies in the north
                                          zone and 100+ individuals from 80 companies attending the south zone meet.




environmental management
our environment management approach aims to achieve continuous improvement in environmental performance in all our
activities. we follow a well-structured process to manage waste, water and energy resources across the group operations.
environment parameters are now aspects of roadmap. employees at all levels are responsible for company's environmental
performance. robust monitoring practices, stringent feedback measures, continuous introspection along with a well-deﬁned
reporting structure, enables us to be ahead of the industry curve on environment kpis.



sustainability reporting contributes to our sustainability agenda in more ways
than one. while we report, we also reect. disclosures result in deliberations and gures
transform into ground level initiatives and strategic interventions.

                                                                                                                                84

calculating specific consumption
we measure our environmental performance on absolute as well as speciﬁc basis. the speciﬁc consumption is calculated by
dividing absolute consumption by a denominator based on the nature of business. for e.g., in case of manufacturing
business units, it is the number of units produced, whereas for services, it is the number of employees, or units of services
offered etc. the denominators for the group companies are delineated in the following table:

nis- not in scope

*in june 2013, mahindra group and spain's cie automotive sa signed a global alliance agreement that resulted in creation
of mahindra cie automotive. as part of the agreement the automotive component businesses of the group under mahindra
forgings ltd., mahindra composites ltd., mahindra hinoday industries ltd., mahindra gears and transmissions pvt ltd. were
merged with cie automotive.

from 2014-15 onwards, out of all the systech companies, only mssspl is part of the group. hence, throughout the chapter,
systech values have been replaced by mssspl values alone.




air quality
breath is the most signiﬁcant
representation of life and the quality of
the air we breathe, directly determines
the health and longevity of our life.
good air quality is vital and we have an
important role to play. we not only
adhere to all statutory norms, but also
effectively use an efﬁcient monitoring
mechanism to keep a check on various
pollutants.

the particulate matter pm10
(size less than 10 µm) & pm2.5 (size less
than 2.5 µm), sulphur oxides (sox) and
nitrogen oxides (nox) are commonly
monitored at all our manufacturing &
service locations, in line with the
revised national ambient air quality
standards (naaqs 2009). some
manufacturing plants also monitor
more speciﬁc pollutants related to their
processes like respirable suspended            ambient air quality 2014-15                                   microgram/m3

notes:
the speciﬁc emissions of ad, mssspl, mtwl, sbu, mreva, sfd, mahindra lifespaces, mll, have shown a drop in the current year, due to
various conservation initiatives implemented by the respective sectors.
the increase at fd is due to a new fuel mix and projects implemented at zaheerabad plant.
increase in mil is due to a new annealing process at kanhe location.
increase in consumption of npd is due to additional machineries at die shop.
mepc has recorded an increase in consumption due to enhancement in scope of reporting.
mhril and mfcsl have recorded increase in consumption due to addition of 7 resorts and 9 locations respectively.
mrv recorded an increase due to increase in engine testing.
mvml, epc, mwc, tech m, cc have recorded an increase and have been alerted accordingly.
fss has an increase because of better quality of data, while in tech m, the increase is due to increase in denominator as well as better
quality of data.

initiatives


combating ghg emissions is deep-seated among mahindra group companies. detailed below is an
example of how individual companies undertake holistic ghg reduction initiatives wherein they focus on
scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions.

                                                                                   the ghg emissions have
processes redesigned to eliminate paper use like vendor                            reduced from 103.66 in
payment process form reduced from 10 pages to 1 page and document                  fy 14 to 90.44 kg / eq.veh.
management system (dms) to avoid printing.
                                                                                   in fy 15.

as part of the portfolio, mepc installed and commissioned a
1 mw solar plant at iit mumbai. over and above green power,
it gave a huge commercial advantage to the institute, as the
cost of power from the plant is inr 4.10/kwh, which is almost
50% of the cost at which they are currently buying power.



 tech mahindra employee commutation survey

 at tech mahindra, we continuously strive towards a sustainable culture within the organisation and connecting
 business growth with responsibility. business growth is coupled with employee growth which in turn leads to a growth
 in the number of vehicles deployed for their commute, leading to an increase in the carbon footprint as well as
 pollution.

 as an it ﬁrm, business travel including employee commute is a signiﬁcant issue and one of the biggest contributors to
 scope 3 emissions. hence, we continuously monitor it as well as take initiatives to reduce it.

 an employee commute survey was conducted in march 2015, with an easy to ﬁll questionnaire which captured the
 travel mode, vehicle type, fuel type and the distance travelled. in a period of one and a half months, about 2,500
 employees took the survey. it was encouraging to see that over and above participation in the survey, a host of
 employees were enthusiastically sharing ideas on how to reduce scope 3 emissions. this led to co-creation of ideas and
 greater ownership.

 results of the interventions will be seen in the next reporting period.

                         conservation is better than restoration. the mahindra group believes in preserving the
                            biodiversity of ecosystems and its services which are beneﬁcial for the communities and the
                                 businesses rather than quick ﬁx solutions for its revival.

                                          as part of the conservation strategy, during the reporting period, we signed

                                       evolved a horticultural development project on marginal, degraded community
                                       lands to enrich their local nutrition, their ecosystem and augment the
                                       community's income.


                                       outcome
                                       the adivasi farmers, who became part of this horticulture project, started
                                       growing arabica coffee through organic agriculture. they use only bio-fertilisers,
                                       bio-pesticides and encourage natural predators such as spiders and ladybirds to

  impact
  'fair trade' coffee grown organically and mostly exported overseas, is now a viable
  livelihood option for these adivasi farmers and brings the coffee-growers annual
  income of inr 100,000 plus.

  naandi foundation also encouraged the adivasi farmer community to form the largest organic coffee cooperative in
  the world -- the small and marginal farmers mutually aided cooperative society (samtfmacs). this coffee
  cooperative ploughs its proﬁts into village development projects like healthcare, ambulances and drinking water.

  naandi foundation's work in the araku region began over 15 years ago and embraces the adivasi values of caring for
  the community and the forests. this makes the programme a success and it continues to positively impact over 100,000
  adivasi lives.

mahindra lifespace developers ltd. can be considered a front runner in
sustainability, as per the assessment. the company focuses on green design of
                                                                                       with this mldl became

to strengthen biodiversity and facilitate reduction in temperature. it also
institutionalises effective and efﬁcient waste management, energy management
                                                                                       developer in india to be
and water management within the cities it develops.                                    featured in this report.
the company's performance on sustainability is considered to be a strong
brand differentiator. this can be further reinforced by enhancing stakeholder
understanding of the company's potential contributions to the wider
ecological system.

the company may be able to create an interesting usp for new developments by
showing how the company's long term presence in an area contributes to the
creation and preservation of ecosystem services available to local stakeholders.
moreover, communicating within the cities about the steps taken by mahindra on
natural capital management, will strengthen the support for mahindra's
approach and will contribute to a sense of pride among employees, companies
and residents.

through its role within the integrated business cities, mahindra may also wish to
explore the opportunities to involve companies within the city in the conservation
and sustainable use of biodiversity. such an initiative could focus on biodiversity
not only within the city, but also on biodiversity policies within the companies,
where companies exchange experiences and best practices.

the next step in this journey should be to integrate natural capital considerations
in the company's supplier requirements, thereby further improving the
company's sustainability performance in the design and construction of
residential homes.

energy is the lifeline of industry as it moves men and machines. but
energy comes at a price, a commercial price and an environmental price. to stay
commercially competitive and environmentally sustainable, we maintain
an unwavering focus on our energy consumption and constantly invest resources
to make our processes more energy efﬁcient. learning from global best
practices, sharing successful initiatives within sectors and functions,
and implementing the best interventions, are all an integral part
of our system.

promoting energy efficiency

as part of our efforts in pioneering and promoting energy
initiatives, we participated in the plenary 'india energy efﬁciency in
buildings laboratory' organised under the aegis of wbcsd (world
business council for sustainable development). energy efﬁcient
buildings (eeb) was the agenda of the session and mahindra
lifespaces was on the wbcsd eeb 2.0 india steering committee.

wbcsd is a ceo-led global coalition straddling business and
sustainable development. it has long-standing relationships in india
with both the confederation of indian industry (cii) and teri bcsd.
its arm, wbcsd india, enables greater in-country cooperation and
knowledge transfer between wbcsd and these organisations.

water
turning negatives into positives needs
courage, commitment and vision.

in fy 2012 -13 we launched an ambitious project 'h20 to h2inﬁnity'
to change the then existing water equation and transform a
fast-depleting reserve, back to tomorrow's inﬁnite resource.
the aim is to ensure that there is enough water
available for a growing india.

in pursuance of this goal, in fy 2013 -14,     but, this is
we crossed an important milestone as      just a milestone,
the mahindra group achieved
water positive status.              we continue on our
                               journey recharged and all our
                        businesses and divisions continue
                  to contribute in their own way to
            conserve every drop of water through
       innovations and initiatives.
                                                                                                                               105

the group marked the start of a focused and accelerated effort to conserve water in 2011-
12 with a 360o water management programme, h2innity. this programme brought
about a massive change in the consumption and conservation of water - not just within
our operations, but also by local communities, our vendors as well as our customers.

                                we operate in a material constrained world. natural resources are
                                under stress as production tries to keep pace with the growing
                             demands of an ever rising population and evolving lifestyles.
                        at mahindra, we are committed to produce more from less and strive to
                            reduce our material consumption. we have also increased the
                                 percentage of alternative materials in our products to curb our
                                      carbon footprint, without affecting the efﬁciency and
                                            performance of our products.

waste
we follow a two pronged strategy on waste - reduction and reuse. less waste means less
disposal cost plus conservation of natural resources and energy. reuse of waste helps cut
raw material costs and decreases the burden on the environment.

this focus on reduction or reuse of waste is pervasive right from the design
stage to the manufacturing process and distribution of ﬁnished
goods. at every step we are looking for opportunities for waste
minimisation and reuse.

whatever waste we generate is responsibly
disposed keeping the compliances, rules
and regulations of the land in mind.




                                            hazardous waste is handed over to authorised hazardous waste collection vendors
                                            equipped with the requisite treatment, storage and disposal facilities, while a major
                                            portion of non-hazardous waste is disposed through contractors who hand it over
                                            to large-scale recycling units or reuse it.

                                                                                                                                    115

     initiatives


     going ahead
     plans are afoot to introduce innovative              utilisation of paint sludge          solar sludge drying bed
     methods for waste management including               for primer making                    for paint sludge




     turning waste to wealth
     miq and group sustainability teamed up to conduct - waste to wealth, a programme that focuses on management of
     solid waste and wastewater and familiarising participants with the newly introduced laws pertaining to hazardous,
     e-waste and biomedical waste management. innovative and proven approaches to waste segregation, removal,
     generation of useful by-products like biogas, cng, briquettes as fuel, recycling of furniture and disposal of solid waste
     were also discussed. the programme attracted a record 50 participants from various group companies including
     auto, farm, two wheelers, cie, spares business unit, mil, mhril and the icing on the cake was the participation
     of suppliers.




     reduction in emissions
     scope 3 emissions were reduced through packaging improvements,
     due to which the estimated wood usage reduction for the year fy 2015 is
     128 tonnes / annum.




                                                                                                                                 119

packaging
as a proponent of sustainable development, it is a huge responsibility to ensure
we 'design out' any potential negative environmental impacts of packaging from
our products. in recent years, we have considerably reduced our consumption of
non-recyclable material to make the packaging of our products convenient,
economical and environment friendly.




                                            spills
                                             spills prevention is prudent in any business. spills increase operating costs, lower
                                             productivity and can have a negative impact on the environment. at mahindra
                                             group, we are committed to ensure complete safety of our operations and the
                                             environment through a comprehensive environment management system which
                                             also encompasses spills. during the reporting period, we did not witness any
                                             signiﬁcant incidents of spills.




environment
compliance
conforming to the environmental laws, rules and regulations is
the cornerstone of any successful business. mahindra group continues
to adhere to environmental compliances and abide by all the applicable
laws of the land for all of its projects. during the reporting period, we were not
ﬁned for any non-compliance.




                                                                                                                                    121

social performance




                                   management approach
                          at mahindra, organisational growth and societal development are two
                    sides of the same coin. hence, we approach social interventions with the same
               commitment, passion and professionalism as our businesses.

               we have been contributing 1% of our proﬁt after tax (pat) towards corporate social
               responsibility (csr) in a structured manner since 2005  long before it became a
               mandate. hence we were better prepared to shift to a higher gear of 2% of three-
               year average net proﬁt as prescribed by the guidelines laid down in the new
               companies act 2013.

               our goal is to create self-sustaining transformations across
               the weaker sections of society by empowering them to rise.

   made landfall near visakhapatnam, andhra pradesh and resulted in
   multiple casualties and losses worth billions of rupees. sadly, in addition to
   economic damage, it also devastated the ecology of visakhapatnam district.

   mahindra committed to plant 0.62 million trees in 7 cyclone affected
   mandals of visakhapatnam district that had lost most of their tree cover.

health support
even today, a chunk of our population grapples with poverty. when basic requirements such as
food, water and shelter are hard to acquire, access to medical support seems like a
distant dream for the underprivileged.

we have always regarded health support as an integral part

towards bringing basic healthcare to the
poor and secluded areas of
our country.
