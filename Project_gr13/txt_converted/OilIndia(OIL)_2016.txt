                                                   managing director


i am delighted to present to you our fourth sustainability report for fy 2015-16. as the    g4-1

second largest national upstream oil & gas company in india, we are committed to
contribute our share towards providing energy solutions to the nation. to fulﬁll this
aspiration, every oil indian thrives to operate with a sense of utmost responsibility,
learning from leading practices globally and staying connected with all our
stakeholders.

as an upstream e&p company, the nature of business we are in, remains to be
unpredictable due to crude oil prices volatility. however, our response has always
been positive towards tackling challenging situations.

we are aware of the socio-economic and environmental impacts of our activities and
our environmental approach mainly focuses on conservation of energy in our
operations apart from other initiatives. we have taken up renewable energy generation
and efﬁciency improvement projects that have resulted in enhancement & overall
sustainability of our operations along with cost savings.

we have presence in some of the remote areas of the country and our social initiatives
focus in diverse areas of education, healthcare, skill & capacity building, livelihood
generation, conservation of biodiversity, infrastructure development etc. we are
committed towards inclusive growth, ensuring that while oil progresses, the nearby
communities also get beneﬁted.

the theme of our sustainability report is 'darpan'. in our view, sustainability is about
balancing the triple bottom line by creating value and communicating our performance
to all our stakeholders in an open and transparent manner. we make sincere efforts to
achieve the same by upholding high standards of ethics. i am conﬁdent that by doing
so, we will not only ensure sustainability of our business but a brighter and sustainable
tomorrow.

            message
                  sustainability at oil india limited comprises of numerous steps that help redeﬁne the future of our business and
                  that of the nation. this has helped bridge gap between our environmental, social and economic performance.

                  although the relationship between economic growth, human well-being and environment has a long and
                  complex history, it has taken an exponential growth in recent decades. the inclination towards reporting
                  environmental and social performance along with economic performance is rapidly taking pace among the
                  organizations. as the world today faces many long term challenges like resource scarcity, rapid urbanization and
                  climate change, it is crucial to effectively utilize the natural resources to ensure business sustainability and
investment outcomes. to keep up with this pace, we have taken steps and have incorporated sustainability matrix along with
traditional metrics, such as ﬁnancial proﬁtability and efﬁciency.

this report highlights our efforts to adopt new approach and demonstrate our ability to sustain for years to come. we strive to
deliver sound ﬁnancial performance each year, which will help in strengthening and materializing india's economic growth.
through our innovative work, we have built a culture of excellence that inspires our people, and ensures holistic progress for all
our stakeholders.

                                                                                                                 director (finance)

                 mankind is an amazing creation of the supernatural power which has bestowed us with mother nature, plentiful of
                 resources, both living and non-living to relish our existence. judicious use of these resources is imperative as
                 gratuitous exploitation will lead to extinction and deprive the future generations to cherish the beauty of life.

                 india is a country, abundant with natural resources - ﬂora & fauna and minerals as well. although harnessing
                 these resources is the crux to the economic and social development of the county, which is cruising at a brisk
                 pace, it is equally imperative to preserve them and maintain an ecological balance for sustaining growth of the
                 nation for ages to come.

oil india limited is involved in the strategic initiative of exploring and exploiting hydrocarbon resources to fuel the development
and growth of the country. it has always been an endeavour of the company to carry out its activities in an environment friendly
manner, true to our vision of commitment to safety, health and environment, thus trying to curb the ecological imbalance to the
extent possible. oil india limited as an entity has also forayed into harnessing renewable energy by setting up solar power plants
and wind farms to fulﬁll the objective of caring for mother nature.

oil india reafﬁrms its commitment to follow the path of growth with sustainability.

with the wish of making sustainable development the guiding light…..
                                                                                                              sudhakar mahapatra
                                                                                             director (exploration & development)

                 sustainability involves balancing the triple bottom line which includes economic, environmental and social risks
                 along with opportunities. organizations with strong culture of sustainability can operate for long term and strive
                 to support a healthy environment and improve lives of their own people and communities around them.

                  human resource management is an integrated approach focusing on organization's faith to work with people.
                  we work towards building positive employee-organization relationship through nurturing initiatives, innovations
                  and aspirations with best practices & commitment and provide professional working environment. employees
                  are central to growth & success of any organization and we have always been proactive in taking up initiatives for
continuous overall development of our employees. this year we implemented our initiative 'udaan' (ushering development and
achieving new horizons), a growth and reorganization journey that outline and delineate the future prospects. through udaan,
we would like to identify growth plan for the company over next 15 years. this will commence by ﬁrst deﬁning overall growth
aspiration, followed by identifying the initiatives to achieve these aspirations and implement these initiatives. we are also
strengthening our csr initiatives to develop local communities around our operational areas and thereby contributing in building
the nation.

this report once again marks our perseverance to contribute to a secure and sustainable future and i would like to thank all our
stakeholders for their support in making this a meaningful journey towards a promising tomorrow.


                                                                                                                   biswajit roy

                                                                    5

                  in today's world, sustainability has become a major driver in integrating company's operations with
                  innovation and technology. our core business comprises of exploration, production and transportation of
                  hydrocarbon and we will continue to carry our business with technological excellence, process efﬁciency
                  and in a responsible manner.

                  we believe innovation has been a driving force in bringing excellence to our operations and conducting our
                  business sustainably. our technological advancements in r&d has resulted in improved oil recovery (ior)
                  and enhanced oil recovery (eor) and enhanced our production performance. we also collaborated with
                  ism dhanbad to produce plant based natural surfactant for the use in eor.

for over 30 years r&d has played a vital role in our operational improvement and we continue to promote such tradition. we
are making progress in exploring shale gas and conducted evaluation for various shale samples in upper assam and
rajasthan basin. in pursuit of moving towards an innovative future, we have helped in ﬁnding new ventures in alternative
energy, especially focusing on renewable energy like solar and wind and commissioned 135.6 mw of renewable energy
projects in different parts of the country.

through our various environmental commitments and social stewardship programs, we wish to bring along the
technological stewardship in our course of doing business. i invite your suggestions and feedback which will help us in
making our journey meaningful.

                  it is my pleasure to present my views in fy 2015-16 sustainability report. we at oil, has served this
                  country for more than ﬁve decades now and has overcome the difﬁcult times with our optimistic approach.
                  today world is witnessing high turmoil in crude oil prices which are affecting the e&p companies across
                  the globe. being in the same sector this has affected our business and has added pressure on our bottom
                  lines. in spite of this, we continue to operate responsibly in areas of our operation without affecting the
                  community and environment.

we have responded the challenges in a constructive way and are trying to increase the production from our matured oil
ﬁelds and check on our overhead expenses. with our focused efforts we are able to achieve balance between our
fundamental business mission to explore and produce more and more quantity of oil and gas.

we initiated the project udaan to prepare for the uncertain times ahead. the project aims to reorganize our style of
functioning to ensure all our productive assets and human resources perform optimally. restructuring and organizational
changes always bring challenges and requires patience and understanding from each employee. despite all the obstacles we
are already leaving our footprints on the path of success and want to congratulate for the accomplishment achieved so far.

we always believe in constructive feedback that help us focusing on key areas of concern.

                                                  project udaan
           initiated in fy 2015-16, udaan is our 15 year growth and reorganization initiative.
          this project has been undertaken to outline the future prospect by first defining the
         aspiration goals, followed by identifying the initiatives for each goal and finally
       implementing the initiatives. under this we have defined six aspiration goals for
     sustainable and responsible growth of the company. across the six strategic goals we
    have identified 30 initiatives and implementing these initiatives will need special focus
   on execution, building capabilities and organizational and operational change. so far we
  have launched 15 initiatives which have benefitted us in different ways.




                                                                          kwh
                                      energy meters
we are in the process of installing electronic energy meters as an energy
conservation initiative. these meters measure, monitor and control the electrical
energy consumed by the occupants at oil township in duliajan. the phase wise
implementation of the meters are monitored by audit & ethics department at
corporate level. depending on the type of building, meters are set to permissible limits
of electrical load and trips automatically if energy is consumed more than allotted
amount.




                                                  renewable energy
                    in order to further strengthen our footprint in area of renewable energy
                  we have established a new grid interactive solar photovoltaic power plant of
                9mwp generation capacity at raghwa, rajasthan at a cost of inr 51.03 crore.
             it is built over an area of 22.5 hectares having 250 wp solar photovoltaic
            modules.

                                              9

                        flare reduction initiative
we have commissioned 37 km natural gas pipeline from baghjan to madhuban. this
has resulted in utilization of non-renewable natural resources to the tune of 32.80
mmscm and helped in reducing the gas flared and related greenhouse gas emissions by
feeding into gas distribution network.




                                                  recycling of drilling fluid:
                  our initiative to recycle drilling/ work over fluid by judicious use of
                bowsers has helped us to reduce the operational cost and the quantity of
              chemicals consumed. we have achieved a cost reduction of 20.75% in work
            over operations and 20% in drilling operations as compared to fy 2014-15.




                      oily sludge recovery
we have installed an oily sludge treatment facility to address the issue of
accumulating oil sludge from our various installations considering its health,
safety & environmental impact. the facility has set up an oily sludge processing
plant near dikom well for processing 5,000 cubic meters of oily sludge. around 1,000
kl of oil was recovered by processing 5,000 kl of oily sludge, thereby reducing safety
and pollution hazards that will lead to a cleaner and greener environment.

we regard that all the stakeholders are important for our continued business growth. we engage
with our stakeholders regularly and have a constructive dialogue with them. the input and feedback
we receive from all our stakeholder groups throughout the year has helped us make informed
changes in our approach to reporting.

suggestions. however, this year we have not conducted a separate stakeholder consultation process. the
management consider that responses from the consultation exercise which included members from the local
communities, oil’s senior management, ofﬁcers and workforce received during fy 2013-14 would still remain
relevant for this reporting year as well.

the primary audience for this report are employees, shareholders and analysts, governments and regulators,

encourage all the stakeholders to peruse this report and provide their valuable feedback in our effort to
improve our performance furthermore in the coming years.

        materiality analysis
        material issues are those that have the greatest potential to impact our responsible business strategy and are the
        most relevant to our stakeholders. understanding and prioritizing these issues has always helped us to carry out
        systematic review of current and future business risks and opportunities based on the feedback from engaging
        internal and external stakeholders to strengthen our strategy.

        the materiality analysis was carried out as per the framework laid out by the gri g4 guidelines and issues
        defined as material in this report are specific to our operations. we will continue to use this framework for all the
        future reporting ventures.

        materiality determination process




              step 1                                   we began the materiality analysis by first dividing our
                                                       stakeholders into two broad categories- internal and external.
                                                       one interesting outcome was the fact that one of the important
           identification                              stakeholder; government is both an external stakeholder in its
                                                       role as a regulator. since we are a public sector undertaking
                                                       (psu), the government is also an internal stakeholder.

                                                                                    we then conducted one-on-one interviews

         we believe that a responsible company has a duty to drive economic growth in its areas of
         operations. it is imperative for the company to maintain a healthy rate of increment in its
         productivity and proﬁtability year on year. in view to this, we have made continued efforts to sustain
         the economic productivity throughout our operations.

the financial decisions of india’s flagship oil & gas exploration and production company remains guided broadly
by the government’s policies and regulations. during the year, we have earned total revenue of inr 1,11,407.7
million against inr 1,10,198.6 million in fy 2014-15 and thus experienced an overall increase of 1.10% in the total
revenue. the crude oil production was 3.247 mmt against production of 3.440 mmt in fy 2014-15. the profit
before tax (pbt) earned in the reporting year was inr 3,46,34.4 million against pbt of inr 3,72,87.0 million in the
fy 2014-15. after deduction of the taxes, profit after tax (pat) was inr 2,33,01.1 million in fy 2015-16 against
pat of inr 2,51,02.0 million in fy 2014-15, showing a decrease of inr 1,800.9 million over the previous year. the
profitability of the company was affected mainly on account of impairments of investments in overseas projects
resulting from fall in crude prices and depleting oil fields.

our existence has provided a boost to the local economy. as an oil and gas company we have geographically
dispersed operation with our sites spread across the length and breadth of india focusing on states in north-east
india. we have hired majority of our supervised workers from communities in and around our operational areas.
this has resulted in significant indirect economic impacts in the nearby areas.

being a psu and having operations across the country, we procure materials, and supply to the various locations
on a competitive basis. we do not have any preference for any locally based suppliers and follows the basic
principle of technically acceptable goods & services while adhering to principles of quality and cost efficiency.

we have always 1invested in the infrastructure development of our operational areas as an organizational
practice. in fy 2015-16 we have invested a total of 794.105 million in infrastructure development.

emissions
the implications and adverse effects of greenhouse gases (ghg) emissions and other air emissions can now be
evidently seen in the form global warming, rise in sea level, melting of glaciers etc. we are aware of the
environmental impacts due to our operations that can lead to release of greenhouse gases emissions and are
determined to act responsibly to reduce the same.


                                                                                                                   g4-en15

our main ghg emissions are from operation due to consumption of crude oil, natural gas, diesel, petrol and grid
electricity. we believe in transparency on disclosing ghg emissions to show our commitment towards
responsible business and this year we chose to report our direct and indirect ghg emissions. our direct ghg
emissions (scope 1) for fy 2015-16 are 5,68,872 tco2e while our indirect ghg emissions (scope 2) are 77,906
tco2e3.


    oil's adaptation and mitigation measures in response to intended nationally determined
    contributions

    as per the directives of mopng and moef&cc, we have to declare our future adaption and mitigation action,
    on reduction of ghg emissions by year 2030 as a part of preparation of intended nationally determined
    contributions (indcs) for india. mitigation measures refers to efforts to reduce ghg by using new
    technologies and renewable energies, making older equipment more energy efﬁcient, or changing
    management practices or consumer behavior. adaptation to climate change refers to reducing vulnerabilities
    and building resilience to the impacts of climate change for the company and the community. though certain
    preliminary information was submitted to moef&cc along with certain emission reduction and climate
    change adaption measures which will bring down the carbon emission in a sequential manner over a period
    of 15 years from 2015 to 2030. the emission reduction (er) measures are aligned with india's indc pledge to
    improve emissions intensity of its gdp by 33-35% by 2030 below 2005 levels. our draft report on adaptation
    and mitigation measures in response to indc shall be put to the board of directors and after obtaining there
    due approval, the said er and cca measures shall be implemented in a phased manner.

        water management
       global availability for freshwater is depleting at a rapid pace and the requirement of freshwater is increasing
       exponentially. water is an essential natural resource used for various activities related to our operations. we
       prioritize the efficient use of water through water reuse and recycling.

       we use freshwater for drilling, hydraulic fracturing, upstream production and biofuel operations. we strive to use
       minimal amount of freshwater by reusing the water in our production. to achieve this, we have also taken several
       initiatives to keep a strict vigil on our water consumption. water meters are being installed at every appropriate
       water inlet and outlet to effectively monitor our consumption.

g4-en8
g4-en10 total volume of water withdrawal from source

       our primary water sources are surface water and ground water. in fy 2015-16, total amount of water withdrawn
       was 12,525,008 kl from our duliajan, manubham and moran operations. the water withdrawn was 15% more
       than fy 2014-15. of the total water withdrawn, 64% was surface water and the remaining 36 % was groundwater.
       the table shows our water withdrawal from different sources for fy 2015-16 at different locations of our
       operations.

       we believe that conservation of water and minimization of water use through water recycling and reuse is a key
       factor in achieving sustainable development. in fy 2015-16 we have reused 3,683,413 kl of water which was
       29.4% of the total water consumption.

effluents and waste management
effective waste management is an important aspect for every organization. our operations result in various types
of waste like oil sludge, drill mud, drill cutting and waste oil. we ensure that the waste is handled, stored and     g4-en22
disposed in compliance with regulations set by the government. in fy 2015-16, we disposed 14,543 numbers of           g4-en23
solid hazardous waste and 45.4 kl of liquid hazardous waste from our drilling and work over rig operations. we
have also disposed 2,663 mt of solid non-hazardous waste from our machinery operation. our focus has always
been on adopting sound waste management practices by efficient recycling and disposal methods.

e-waste management
electronic waste or e-waste that consists of electrical and electronic equipment needs to be disposed in safe and
proper way. due to its hazardous nature, if discarded in an improper manner may lead to health and
environmental hazards. we disposed our e-waste in an environmental friendly way and awarded contract to a
third party to provide end to end solutions for collecting and recycling the e-waste. they collect our e-waste from
six location viz. fhq duilijan, pipelines, kolkata office, corporate office noida, rajasthan project and bep after
every six months and transport them to e-waste management facility in roorkee, uttrakhand. during the
reporting year, more than 38 tonnes of e-waste have been collected and disposed/ recycled as per regulatory
requirement.

          oil spills

          zero or minimizing spills is one of the top priorities for oil. we take adequate measures to prevent spills and
          improve our ability to measure spills. we make diligent efforts, to achieve zero spills, but this year we recorded
          total of 990.4 kl oil spill in our production installation.

g4-en24
          spills management

          there is spillage of crude oil on the surface due to our operational activities like back-washing of wells, pigging
          of crude oil line, leaking of crude oil line etc. and also due to miscreant activities. the spillage become hazardous
          to environment by contaminating surface and ground water. they also degrade the quality of top soil. we have
          outsourced to pick up such spilled crude from fields. the present contract is for a period of two years. in fy
          2015-16 2321 kl spilled oil has been picked up and been used or disposed in an environmentally safe manner.


          bio remediation treatment

          bio-remediation is a treatment by the application of ''oilzapper" on oil spill sites, oil contaminated soil, oil soaked
          soil/ oily sludge, etp oily sludge, oil soaked/ sobm (synthetic oil based mud) soaked drill cuttings, tank bottom
          oily sludge, oil-contaminated water to restore the site to conform with statutory norms. it is carried out by both
          "in-situ'' & ex-situ'' process.

          the process by which treatment is being carried out at the same place where sludge is presently lying is known
          as in-situ bio-remediation. the process by which sludge is lifted to a central location and treatment is carried out
          is known as ex-situ bio-remediation.

          we took an initiative to apply this technique at the production installation. in fy 2015-16 we were able to bio-
          remediate 9000 cubic meter oily sludge through in-situ technique and 8500 cubic meter through ex-situ
          technique. we have set a target to treat a total of 30,000 cubic meter oily sludge through this technique over next
          two years.

flaring is the gas produced when oil is extracted to the surface. this can also be produced by uncontrolled
burning of natural gas in an oil & gas reservoir. although the flaring gas from the extraction of oil is a waste, it is
still a valuable resource. this also contributes to climate change through emissions and thus needs to be
controlled. since the infrastructure available to reuse this valuable energy sources are not available, these
gases pose a significant safety risk to the community and contribute extensively to ghgs and pollutants. at oil,
we are committed to minimize flaring in our process although it is very challenging to reduce flaring and venting
to zero. in fy 2015-16, we are disclosing our volume of gas flared from or arunachal pradesh and assam
operations.

volume and disposal of produced water

our operations produces signiﬁcant volumes of formation or produced water. produced water has substantial
adverse effect on environment since they contain process chemical and contaminants that are naturally occurring
in oil and gas reservoirs. these reservoirs also contain hydrocarbons, salts and heavy metals.

this water is treated and then released back into process for further usage. in fy 2015-16 our operations
produced 3,070,449.240 kl of water from arunachal pradesh and assam region and 100% of water was re-
injected in the process.

         biodiversity
         we have our operations in diverse environmental regions near biodiversity hotspots. thus some of them are
         located in biodiversity rich zones, especially our sites in assam and arunachal pradesh. at oil, we understand
         the importance of natural and cultural resources and their benefit to communities. as a responsible producer we
         take proactive and forward looking steps for the management of biodiversity in protected and sensitive areas.

         biodiversity conservation

         moving forward on the footprints of our belief we have launched a conservation program to protect the habitat of
         endangered hoolock gibbon, this specie is also listed in iucn red list and is found in few sites in and around our
         operational areas. the project is a step towards our long term commitment for the steadfast protection of the rich
         rainforests in and around our operational areas in assam and arunachal pradesh, which in turn ensures the
         future conservation of the hoolock gibbon and many such endangered species in their natural habitats. we plan
         to further expand our program to the site that may be affected by our operations in critical habitats.

         awareness campaigns were carried out in many villages situated on the fringes of the hoolock gibbon habitats.
         these included many villages in the dibrugarh, tinsukia, golaghat and jorhat districts of assam. the followings
         are the main focus areas:

         ¦   dibrugarh district: joypur, upper dihing, dirak and fringe areas of dihingpatkai wildlife sanctuary
         ¦   tinsukia district: barekuri area, fringes of dibrusaikhowa national park, dhola area
         ¦   golaghat district: fringe areas of nambor doigrong wildlife sanctuary.
         ¦   jorhat district: fringes of holongapar gibbon wildlife sanctuary.


         we are committed towards preservation of the biodiversity in the areas we operate. we have conducted and
         assess the risk impact from our operations on surrounding biodiversity. we have carried out environmental
         impact assessment (eia) to assess, identify and monitor sites where biodiversity risk are prevalent. we have
         conducted assessment at jairampur pel block, changlang district, arunachal pradesh, teok block, district -
         jorhat, assam and khajorijan block, dibrugarh/tinsukia district, assam.


         biodiversity action plan methodology of oil

         during the year 2015-16, we carried out two eia studies in its upcoming fields in assam and arunachal pradesh.
         for each of our operational sites post 2011, we have assessed the biodiversity risk and have environmental
         management plans in compliance to the environmental regulations, which includes forest, wildlife and
         biodiversity conservation. however, we have not assessed and monitored the biodiversity risk across all the
         operational areas.

         the eia reports are prepared based on baseline data collected over a span of 3-4 month in each operational
         block. the study includes baseline environmental conditions and eia is carried out on parameters like
         physiography and topography, soils quality, water resources and water quality, climatology and meteorology,
         ambient air quality, noise, land use etc. based on the results, environment management plan and environment
         monitoring programme is made. additionally, risk assessment is carried out and disaster management plan is
         made.

                                                                55

          environmental compliance

          we adhere to all the regulations and guidelines related to our operation and are compliant to all relevant
          environmental regulations implemented by moef and pollution control board. along with this we are compliant
          with any special requirement for operating in sensitive areas.

          environmental grievance redressal
g4-en34
          we have always adhered to our values of being ethical and transparent and we provide a robust environmental
          grievance mechanism that can be easily accessible by our community. we believe that effective communication
          can help in avoiding and alleviating the grievances and therefore our safety, environmental, public relations and
          corporate communications are always open to receive complaints and ensure that communities are able to
          express their views in different ways. the concerned departments address these complaints diligently and swiftly
          so that there is no pending grievance. however, we have not formulated a separate mechanism for social and
          environmental grievances as the issues are tangled in our areas of operations.

          in fy 2015-16, we received 106 numbers of environmental grievances which were addressed through a single
          mechanism. our safety & environment and public relation & corporate communications department were
          tasked to receive the complaints and remedying the environmental and social grievances received. the major
          areas of grievances include noise disturbance, effluent leakage, crude oil leakage and gas broaching.

 potential to have off site impacts which could be
 of such a magnitude that is likely to affect the
 population, property and environment inside and
 outside the installation. this plan finally falls under the purview of the
 concerned district authority. as per the institutional framework each district
 has its own district disaster management authority (ddma) chaired by the
 deputy commissioner. however, till they step in, the chief co-coordinator of
 the industry/sphere is responsible to manage.

    installation and requires mobilization of resources beyond oil capabilities, the level iii dmp (mutual aid –
    onsite & offsite) will be activated initially by the head of sphere till such time district authority takes over as
    the chief coordinator (cc) and accordingly all cleared signals will be cleared by district authority. however,
    the mutual aid scheme is under the purview of the district authority.
s when the emergency is of such magnitude that it is gradually affecting the normal pattern of life within the
    industrial complex and gets suddenly disrupted and in certain cases affects the neighborhood seriously and
    requires corporate and national intervention , assistance from other work sphere/ agencies are sought
    through corporate intervention. corporate level (level-iv) dmp is then activated.

        development in its areas of operation.




with over five decades of our operation and working in remotest areas of india, we at oil have a strong belief that
our operations have major impact on societies and communities. we work at sites located near tea gardens,
small towns and villages and feel a substantial responsibility towards the communities and societies we operate
in. as a psu we have a very distinct and specific responsibility to the people, for which we engage with local
communities and understand their concerns and develop relationship based on trust and respect. our operations
have majorly positive impact with marginal negative impact on the society and the community.

we believe that the way an organization manages its measure of corporate social responsibility reflects its ethics
and integrity. our every action involves local community of our sphere of operation. at forefront of our social
responsibility comes the safety of our communities. we screen for socio economic impact of our operations and
ensures that there is no adverse impact in regards to safety of our community. we also conduct impact
assessment during project planning to understand possible negative impact of the project and avoid or mitigate
the negative impact. we try to align our csr activities with national development agenda and our activities are
focused on areas of healthcare, sustainable livelihoods, education, capacity building etc.


our csr policy

we work through our project implementing partners and district administration to implement our csr
programmes which serve as a catalyst to achieve our objective of sustainable and inclusive development. any
csr initiative to address a social cause, supported by oil india limited is screened through a process of need
assessment survey, baseline survey and based on request from local community of our operational areas.
