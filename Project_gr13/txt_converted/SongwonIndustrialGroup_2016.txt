                       complementary to the more essential main ao range songwon’s differentiated specialty
                       phenolic and phosphite antioxidants provide plastics and resins with enhanced performance
                       and robustness for even the harshest conditions.


                     ■ thioesters

                       thioesters are used to decompose and neutralize hydroperoxides formed by the oxidation
                       of polymers. they provide heat aging protection and improve the color stability of polymers.
                       thioesters are produced by our jv songwon baifu chemicals (tangshan) co., ltd. in china
                       and offered to customers through our global sales and support network.


                     ■ hals, uvas & hydroxybenzoates

                       songwon has one of the largest product ranges of light stabilizers, including hindered
                       amine light stabilizers (hals).


                       as a primary antioxidant with low color generation, hals protect polymers from degradation
                       due to uv exposure. uv absorbers provide protection by absorbing the energy from the
                       uv radiation and through a reversible process, dissipate the energy as heat. optimal uv
                       protection is achievable with combinations of hals and uvas.

                                     once a polymer has been damaged by uv light and free radicals are formed, hydroxy-
                                     benzoates act as free radical scavengers to protect the polymer from degradation. some
                                     hydroxybenzoates can also act as uv absorbers. by performing in synergy with hals they
                                     provide superior performance.


                                     we have a distribution arrangement in place with sabo spa, the global ‘number 2’
                                     manufacturer of monomeric and polymeric hals.

                                                   independent auditors’ report


    to the shareholders and board of directors of
    songwon industrial co., ltd. and its subsidiaries

    we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of songwon industrial
    co., ltd. (the company) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the group), which comprise
    the consolidated statements of financial position as at december 31, 2015 and 2014, and the
    consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and
    consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended, and a summary of significant
    accounting policies and other explanatory information.


    management's responsibility for the consolidated financial statements

    management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with korean international financial reporting standards (kifrs), and for
    such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
    consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
    error.


    auditors’ responsibility

    our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
    republic of korea. those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
    are free from material misstatement.

    an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
    in the consolidated financial statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment,
    including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
    statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
    internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
    statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
    the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. an audit also
    includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
    accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
    consolidated financial statements.

    we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
    for our audit opinion.

  2        summary of significant accounting policies

  2.1      basis of preparation

  the financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with the established korean international
  financial reporting standards ('k-ifrs') adopting international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as issued
  by the international accounting standards board (iasb) in accordance with item 1 of the 1st clause of article 13 of
  external audit law.

  the financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain items, such as financial
  instruments, which are mentioned separately in the following accounting principles. the financial statements
  are presented in korean won (krw) and all values are rounded off to the nearest million (000,000), except when
  otherwise indicated.

  the group maintains its official accounting records in korean won and prepares statutory financial statements
  in the korean language in conformity with k-ifrs. in the event of any differences in interpreting the financial
  statements or the independent auditor’s report thereon, the korean version, which is used for regulatory reporting
  purposes, shall prevail.



  2.2      basis of consolidation

  the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the group and its subsidiaries as
  of december 31, 2015. control is achieved when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from                           105
  its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
  specifically, the group controls an investee if, and only if, the group has:
  ■■ power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the

     investee)
  ■■ exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee

  ■■ the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns



  when the group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the group considers all relevant
  facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
  ■■ the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee

  ■■ rights arising from other contractual arrangements

  ■■ the group’s voting rights and potential voting rights



  the group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are
  changes to one or more of the three elements of control. consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the group obtains
  control over the subsidiary and ceases when it loses control of the subsidiary. assets, liabilities, income and expenses
  of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from
  the date that the group gains control until the date that it ceases to control the subsidiary.

  profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (oci) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent
  of the group and to the non-controlling interests, even if the results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit
  balance. when necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align their accounting
  policies with the group’s accounting policies. all intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash
  flows relating to transactions between members of the group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

  a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.




                                                                                 songwon annual financial & sustainability report 2015

      2.3       convenience translation into united states dollar amounts

      the company operates primarily in korean won and its official accounting records are maintained in korean won.
      the us dollar amounts provided in the financial statements represent supplementary information solely for the
      convenience of the reader. all won amounts are expressed in us dollars at the rate of krw 1,177.44 to usd 1, the
      exchange rate in effect on december 31, 2015. such a presentation is not in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and should not be construed as a representation that the won amounts shown could be
      readily converted, realized or settled in us dollars at this or at any other rate.



          business combinations and goodwill
      2.4	

      business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. the cost of an acquisition is measured
      as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any
      non-controlling interest in the acquiree. for each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling
      interest in the acquiree – either at fair value, or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
      acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.

      in business combinations achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to
      its acquisition date fair value.

      any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.
      subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration, which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will
      be recognized in profit or loss.
106
      goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the
      amount recognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
      if this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is
      recognized in profit or loss.

      after initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. for the purpose of
      impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of
      the group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other
      assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.



      2.5       interest in joint arrangements

      joint ventures
      a joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have
      rights to the net assets of the joint venture. joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an
      arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the
      parties sharing control. the considerations made in determining joint control are similar to those necessary to
      determine control over subsidiaries.

      the group’s investments in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. under the equity method, the
      investment in a joint venture and is initially recognized at cost. the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to
      recognize changes in the group’s share of net assets of the joint venture since the acquisition date.

  the statement of profit or loss reflects the group’s share of the results of operations of the joint venture.
  any change in oci of those investees is presented as part of the group’s oci. in addition, when there has been
  a change recognized directly in the equity of a joint venture, the group recognizes its share of any changes, when
  applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between
  the group and the joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the joint venture.

  the aggregate of the group’s share of profit or loss in a joint venture is shown on the face of the statement of
  profit or loss outside operating profit, and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling interests in the
  subsidiaries of the joint venture.

  the financial statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the group. when
  necessary, adjustments are made to align the accounting policies with those of the group.

  at each reporting date, the group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the joint
  venture is impaired. if there is such evidence, the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference
  between the recoverable amount of the joint venture and its carrying value. it then recognizes the loss as 'share of
  profit of a joint venture' in the statement of profit.

  upon loss of significant influence over the joint venture, the group measures and recognizes any retained
  investment at its fair value. any difference between the carrying amount of the joint venture – upon loss of
  significant influence or joint control – and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is
  recognized in profit or loss.

  joint operations
  a joint operation is defined as an arrangement in which the parties with joint control have rights to the assets                      107
  and obligations for the liabilities relating to that arrangement. in respect of its interest in a joint operation, a joint
  operator must recognize all of its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, including its relative share of jointly
  controlled assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.

  the considerations made in determining joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over
  subsidiaries.



  2.6      foreign currency translation

  the financial statements are presented in korean won, which is the parent company’s functional currency.
  each entity in the group determines its own functional currency, and items included in the financial statements of
  each entity are measured using that functional currency.

  transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the group companies at their respective functional
  currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
  currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.
  non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange
  rates at the dates of the initial transactions. non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are
  translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.

  the assets, including goodwill and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is other than
  the korean won, are translated using the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while the statements of
  income are translated using average exchange rates during the period. differences arising from such translations
  are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign
  subsidiary is recognized.




                                                                                songwon annual financial & sustainability report 2015

      2.7       property, plant and equipment

      'property, plant and equipment' is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
      losses. such costs include the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs
      for long-term construction projects, if the recognition criteria are met. other repair and maintenance costs are
      recognized in the income statement as incurred. if the costs of certain components of an item of property, plant and
      equipment are significant in relation to the total cost of the item, they are accounted for and depreciated separately.

      depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method. the following useful lives are assumed:


      land                     no depreciation
      buildings                18 to 54 years
      structures               6 to 39 years
      machinery                10 to 20 years
      other                    1 to 10 years

      residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and, if expectations differ from previous estimates,
      adjusted accordingly.

      the gain or loss arising from derecognition of a property, plant or equipment shall be determined as the difference
      between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset. it shall be recognized in the income
      statement when the asset is derecognized.



108   2.8       intangible assets

      intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. the cost of intangible assets
      acquired in a business combination is its fair value as at the date of acquisition. following initial recognition,
      intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

      intangible assets with useful finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment
      whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. the amortization period and the
      amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at the least at the end of each
      reporting period. changes in the expected useful life or the expected consumption pattern of future economic
      benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate,
      and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. the amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives
      is recognized in the income statement under cost of sales, and selling and administration costs in the expense
      category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets.

      intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (such as goodwill and memberships) are not amortized, but are tested
      for impairment annually – either individually, or at the cash-generating unit level. the assessment of indefinite life
      is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. if not, the change in useful
      life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

      gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
      disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognized in the income statement when the
      asset is derecognized.

  intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method with the following useful lives:



  software                                                        3 to 10 years
  industrial rights                                               10 years
  useful lives of items recognized in business combinations       over its useful life between 5 to 9 years
  customer relationships                                          5 to 9 years
  non-compete agreements                                          6 years
  process technologies                                            5 to 6 years

  the useful lives of customer relationships and process technologies were adjusted in 2014 based on the effective
  useful lives of the intangible assets acquired in the prior period.



  2.9      investment property

  the group classifies property for earning rentals or capital appreciation, or both, as investment properties.
  as investment properties are accounted for using a cost model, the same accounting policies applied to property,
  plant and equipment are used for their accounting treatment, except for their classification and presentation.



  2.10     leases

  the determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement
  at inception date, whether fulfillment of the arrangement depends on the use of a specific asset or assets, and the                109
  arrangement conveys a right to use the asset, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

  group as a lessee
  finance leases, which transfer substantially to the group all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the
  leased item, are capitalized at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at
  the present value of the minimum lease payments. lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and
  reduction of the lease liability, so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
  finance charges are recognized in finance costs in the income statement.

  a leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. however, if there is no reasonable certainty that the
  group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of its estimated
  useful life and the lease term.

  operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis
  over the lease term.

  group as a lessor
  leases, in which the group does not substantially transfer all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset,
  are classified as operating leases. initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the
  carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income.
  contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned. the group has not entered into
  finance lease agreements as a lessor.




                                                                             songwon annual financial & sustainability report 2015

      2.11      impairment of non-financial assets

      the group reviews non-financial assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
      the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for
      assets, such as membership is required, the group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. recoverability of assets
      is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the recoverable amount, which is the higher
      of the asset’s value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. if assets do not generate cash inflows that are largely
      independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the impairment test is not performed at an individual
      asset level, but at the level of the cash-generating unit (cgu) to which the asset belongs.

      where the carrying amount of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and
      is written down to its recoverable amount. in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to
      their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
      and the risks specific to the asset. in determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken
      into account, if available. if no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.

      for assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication
      that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. if such an indication exists,
      the group estimates the asset or cgu’s recoverable amount. a previously recognized impairment loss is reversed
      only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last
      impairment loss was recognized. the reversal is limited, so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its
      recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no
      impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. such a reversal is recognized in the income statement.

110   the following criteria are also applied in assessing impairment of specific assets:

      goodwill
      goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of december 31, as well as whenever there are events or changes in
      circumstances (triggering events), which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. goodwill is carried
      at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

      for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the (groups
      of) cgu(s) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. if the carrying amount of
      the cgu(s), to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss on goodwill is
      recognized. the recoverable amount is the higher of the cgu(s) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
      impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.

      intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
      intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as of december 31 either
      individually, or at the cgu level, as appropriate and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be
      impaired.



      2.12      borrowing costs

      borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset, which necessarily
      takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalized as part of the cost of the
      respective assets.

  2.13     inventories

  inventory is valued at the lower of the acquisition or production cost and net realizable value; cost being generally
  determined on the basis of a weighted average. production costs comprise direct material and labor and applicable
  manufacturing overheads, including depreciation charges based on normal operating capacity. net realizable value
  is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling
  expenses



  2.14     cash and cash equivalents

  cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks, as well as on-hand and
  short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less.



  2.15     provisions

  a provision is recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event.
  it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
  can be made of the amount of the obligation. if the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by
  discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
  value of money.



  2.16     pensions and other long-term employment benefits                                                                          111


  pensions
  the group operates three defined benefit pension plans: one in korea, one in switzerland and one in india.
  the cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method.

  re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and
  the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognized immediately in the statement of financial position
  with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through oci in the period in which they occur.
  re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.

  past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of:
  ■■ the date of the plan amendment or curtailment

  ■■ the date that the group recognizes restructuring-related costs



  net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. the pension
  expenses are recognized in the income statement under cost of sales, and selling and administration costs.

  other long-term employment benefits
  the parent company also implements a bonus plan designed to present a prescribed quantity of gold to long-term
  service employees and to entitle them to compensated vacation. the bonus plan’s accounting policies are mostly the
  same as the defined benefit plan, except that re-measurements are recognized immediately in profit or loss.




                                                                             songwon annual financial & sustainability report 2015

      2.17      taxes

      current income tax
      current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered
      from or paid to the taxation authorities. the tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are
      enacted, or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the group operates and generates
      taxable income.

      deferred tax
      deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax
      basis of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

      deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:
      ■■ where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a trans-

         action that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit,
         nor taxable profit or loss.
      ■■ in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and i­nterests

         in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is proba-
         ble that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

      deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits
      and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the
      deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be
      utilized, except:
112   ■■ where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of

         an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects
         neither the accounting profit, nor taxable profit or loss.
      ■■ in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and

         interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the
         temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future, and taxable profit will be available against which the
         temporary differences can be utilized.

      the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is
      no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be
      utilized. unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date, and recognized to the extent that
      it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. deferred tax
      assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realized
      or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
      reporting date.

      deferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss. deferred tax
      items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction, either in other comprehensive income, or directly
      in equity.

      deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset – if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax
      assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same
      taxation authority.

  2.18     revenue recognition

  revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and
  the revenue can be reliably measured. revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
  receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. the following
  specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized:

  sale of goods
  revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have
  passed to the buyer.

  interest income
  for all financial instruments, measured at amortized cost and interest-bearing financial assets classified as
  available for sale, interest income or expense is recorded using the effective interest rate (eir). this is the rate
  that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial
  instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.
  interest income is included in finance income in the income statement.

  rental income
  rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over
  the lease terms and included in revenue due to its operating nature.

  dividends
  revenue is recognized when the group’s right to receive the payment is established.
                                                                                                                                       113


  2.19     financial instruments

  a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or
  equity instrument of another entity.

  financial assets
  all financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus; in the case of investments not at fair value through
  profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs apply. purchases or sales of financial assets that require
  delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular way
  trades) are recognized on the trade date i.e. the date that the group commits to purchase or sell the asset.

  the subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification:
  ■■ at fair value through profit or loss

  ■■ held to maturity

  ■■ loans and receivables

  ■■ a ll other financial assets are classified as 'available-for-sale'



  the group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.




                                                                               songwon annual financial & sustainability report 2015

           50 years leaping ahead in the world of polymers




       inancial assets at fair value through profit or loss
      f
      financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and those designated
      upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. financial assets are classified as held for trading if they
      are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. this category includes derivative financial
      instruments entered into by the group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as
      defined by k-ifrs 1039. derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for
      trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. financial assets at fair value through profit
      and loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
      finance income or finance costs in the income statement.

      the group has not designated any financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.

       oans and receivables
      l
      loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted
      in an active market. after initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost
      using the effective interest rate method (eir), less impairment. amortized cost is calculated by taking into account
      any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir.
      the eir amortization is included in finance income in the income statement. the losses arising from impairment
      are recognized in the income statement in finance costs.

      held-to-maturity investments
       non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held-to-
       maturity when the group has the positive intention and ability to hold it to maturity. after initial measurement, held-
       to-maturity investments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less impairment.
114    as for loans and receivables above the eir, amortization is included in finance income in the income statement. the
       losses arising from impairment are recognized in the income statement in finance costs.

       vailable-for-sale financial investments
      a
      available-for-sale financial investments include equity and debt securities. equity investments classified as
      available-for-sale are those which are neither classified as held for trading, nor designated at fair value through
      profit or loss. debt securities in this category are those which are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time
      and which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity, or to changes in market conditions.

      after initial measurement, available-for-sale financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value with
      unrealized gains or losses recognized as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the
      investment is derecognized. at this time the cumulative gain or loss is recognized in other income, or determined to
      be impaired, and the cumulative loss is reclassified to the income statement in finance costs and removed from the
      available-for-sale reserve.

       erecognition of financial assets
      d
      a financial asset (or where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is
      derecognized when:
      ■■ the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.

      ■■ the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the

         received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement; and either
         (a) the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the group has neither
         transferred, nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the

  when the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through
  arrangement, and has neither transferred, nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor
  transferred its control of the asset, it is recognized to the extent of the group’s continuing involvement in the asset.
  in that case, the group also recognizes an associated liability. the transferred asset and the associated liability are
  measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the group has retained. continuing involvement that
  takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of
  the asset, and the maximum amount of consideration that the group could be required to repay.

  impairment of financial assets
  further disclosures relating to impairment of financial assets are also provided in the following notes:
  ■■ note 3: disclosures for significant assumptions

  ■■ note 15: trade receivables



  at each reporting date, the group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group
  of financial assets is impaired. an impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial
  recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial
  asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. evidence of impairment may include indications
  that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in
  interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, and
  observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes
  in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.

  
  financial  assets carried at amortized cost
  for financial assets carried at amortized cost, the group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment
  exists for those that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.        115
  if the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset,
  whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics
  and collectively assesses them for impairment. assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an
  impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.

  available-for-sale financial investments
  in the case of equity investments, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair
  value of the investment below its cost – a ‘significant decline’ is evaluated against the original cost of the investment
  and a ‘prolonged decline’ against the period in which the fair value has been below its original cost.
  in the case of debt instruments, impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as financial assets carried at
  amortized cost. however, the amount recorded for impairment is the cumulative loss measured as the difference
  between the amortized cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously
  recognized in the income statement.

  financial liabilities
  all financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value, and in the case of loans and borrowings, including
  directly attributable transaction costs.
  the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification:
  ■■ financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

  ■■ loans and borrowings



  the group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.




                                                                                 songwon annual financial & sustainability report 2015

       inancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
      f
      financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial
      liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. financial liabilities are
      classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. this category includes
      derivative financial instruments entered into by the group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge
      relationships.

      gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the income statement.
      the group has not designated any financial liabilities upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.

      loans and borrowings
         after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost
         using the effective interest rate (eir) method. gains and losses are recognized in the income statement when the
         liabilities are derecognized, as well as through the eir amortization process.

      amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that
      are an integral part of the eir. the eir amortization is included in finance costs in the income statement.

      derecognition
        a financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
        when an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms,
        or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a
        derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. the difference in the respective carrying
        amounts is recognized in the income statement.
116
      offsetting of financial instruments
      financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statement of
      financial position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and
      there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

      derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
      the group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps,
      to hedge its foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks. such derivative financial instruments are
      initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently
      re-measured at fair value. derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial
      liabilities when the fair value is negative.

      c
       ash flow hedges
      any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the income statement,
      except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. amounts
      recognized as other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction
      affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognized.

      if the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously
      recognized in equity is transferred to the income statement. if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated
      or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss
      previously recognized in other comprehensive income remains in other comprehensive income until the forecast
      transaction or firm commitment affects profit or loss.

      the group applies cash flow hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts.

  2.20     new and amended standards and interpretations

  the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the following
  amendments to k-ifrs effective as of january 1, 2015 and as adopted by the group:

  amendments to k-ifrs 1019 defined benefit plans: employee contributions
  k-ifrs 1019 requires an entity to consider contributions from employees or third parties when accounting for
  defined benefit plans. where the contributions are linked to service, they should be attributed to periods of service
  as a negative benefit. these amendments clarify that, if the amount of the contributions is independent of the
  number of years of service, an entity is permitted to recognize such contributions as a reduction in the service cost
  in the period in which the service is rendered, instead of allocating the contributions to the periods of service. this
  amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after july 1, 2014. this amendment is relevant to the
  group, since some of its entities have defined benefit plans with contributions from employees. the standard was
  applied for the annual actuarial calculation as per december 31, 2014.

  the group has assessed that the aforementioned standard's impact on its consolidated financial statements will not
  be significant for the year in which it applies this standard for the first time.




                                                                                                                                    117

      3	significant accounting judgments, estimates and
         assumptions
      the preparation of the group’s financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure
      of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. however, uncertainty about these assumptions and
      estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or
      liability affected in future periods. the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation
      uncertainty at the reporting date, which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
      amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below.

      note     description      nature of estimation
      7, 8,    impairment       impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its
      9, 10    of               recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in
               non-financial    use. the determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the
               assets /         use of estimates by management. the ‘fair value less costs to sell’ calculation is based on
               goodwill         available data from binding sales transactions in an arm’s length transaction of similar assets
                                or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. the ‘value in
                                use’ calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. the cash flows are derived from
                                the expectations for the next three years and do not include restructuring activities that the
                                group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s
                                performance of the cash-generating unit being tested. the recoverable amount based on the
                                value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model
                                (wacc), as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation
                                purposes. the recoverable amount based on the fair value less cost to sell is most sensitive to
118                             the market prices, premiums and the estimate of cost to sell. these estimates, including the
                                methodologies used, can have a material impact on the fair value and ultimately, the amount of
                                any goodwill impairment.
      9        customer         customer relations are depreciated over their estimated useful life. the estimated useful life is
               relations        based on estimates of the time period during which this intangible asset generates cash flows,
                                as well as historic empirical data concerning customer loyalty. calculation of the present value
                                of estimated future cash flows includes essential assumptions, especially of future sales. in
                                addition, discounting is based on assumptions and estimations concerning business-specific
                                capital costs, which are themselves dependent on national risks and additional risks resulting
                                from the volatility of the respective business.
      20, 21 pension and        the cost of defined benefit pension plans and other similar long-term employee benefits,
             other              and the present value of the pension obligation are determined using actuarial valuations.
             employment         an actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions, which may differ from actual
             benefits           developments in the future. these include the determination of the discount rate, future salary
                                increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. due to the complexity of the valuation,
                                the underlying assumptions and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly
                                sensitive to changes in these assumptions.
      28.2     deferred tax     deferred tax assets are recognized for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that
               assets           taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. significant management
                                judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized,
                                based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax
                                planning strategies.
      24       fair value       where the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is recorded in the statement of financial
               of financial     position cannot be derived from active markets, their fair value is determined using valuation
               instruments      techniques including the discounted cash flow model. inputs in these models are taken from
                                observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is
                                required in establishing fair values. the judgments include considerations of inputs, such as
                                liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. changes in assumptions about these factors could affect
                                the reported fair value of financial instruments.

  4        standards issued but not yet effective

  the standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the group’s
  financial statements are disclosed below. the group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they
  become effective:

  k-ifrs 1109 financial instruments
  the korean accounting standards board (kasb) issued the final version of k-ifrs 1109 financial instruments
  that replaces k-ifrs 1039 financial instruments: recognition and measurement and all previous versions. k-ifrs
  1109 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project: classification and
  measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. k-ifrs 1109 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after
  january 1, 2018, with early application permitted. except for hedge accounting, retrospective application is required
  but providing comparative information is not compulsory. for hedge accounting, the requirements are generally
  applied prospectively, with some limited exceptions. the group plans to adopt the new standard on the required
  effective date.

  k-ifrs 1115 revenue from contracts with customers
  k-ifrs 1115 was issued in may 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts
  with customers. under k-ifrs 1115, revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an
  entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. the new revenue standard
  will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under k-ifrs. either a full retrospective application
  or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after january 1, 2018. early
  adoption is permitted. the group performed a preliminary assessment of k-ifrs 1115 which is subject to changes
  arising from a more detailed ongoing analysis. the group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective                119
  date.

  amendments to k-ifrs 1110 and k-ifrs 1028: sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its
  associate or joint venture
  the amendments address the conflict between k-ifrs 1110 and k-ifrs 1028 in dealing with the loss of control
  of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture. the amendments clarify that the gain
  or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that constitute a business, as defined in k-ifrs 1103,
  between an investor and its associate or joint venture, is recognized in full. any gain or loss resulting from the
  sale or contribution of assets that do not constitute a business, however, is recognized only to the extent of
  unrelated investors’ interests in the associate or joint venture. these amendments must be applied prospectively
  and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. these
  amendments are not expected to have any impact on the group.

  amendments to k-ifrs 1111 joint arrangements: accounting for acquisitions of interests
  the amendments to k-ifrs 1111 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint
  operation, in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business, must apply the relevant k-ifrs 1103
  principles for business combinations accounting. the amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in
  a joint operation is not re-measured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation, while
  joint control is retained. in addition, scope exclusion has been added to k-ifrs 1111 to specify that the amendments
  do not apply when the parties sharing joint control, including the reporting entity, are under common control of
  the same ultimate controlling party. the amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint
  operation and the acquisition of any additional interests in the same joint operation, and are prospectively effective
  for annual periods beginning on or after january 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. these amendments are not
  expected to have any impact on the group.

      amendments to k-ifrs 1016 and k-ifrs 1038: clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and
      amortization
      the amendments clarify the principle in k-ifrs 1016 and k-ifrs 1038 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic
      benefits that are generated from operating a business (of which the asset is part), rather than the economic benefits
      that are consumed through use of the asset. as a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate
      property, plant and equipment, and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortize intangible assets.
      the amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after january 1, 2016, with early
      adoption permitted. these amendments are not expected to have any impact on the group as it has not used a
      revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets.

      amendments to k-ifrs 1027: equity method in separate financial statements
      the amendments will allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint
      ventures and associates in their separate financial statements. entities already applying k-ifrs and electing to
      change to the equity method in its separate financial statements will have to apply this change retrospectively.
      the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1, 2016, with early adoption
      permitted. these amendments will not have any impact on the group’s consolidated financial statements.

      amendments to k-ifrs 1001 disclosure initiative
      the amendments to k-ifrs 1001 presentation of financial statements clarify, rather than significantly change,
      existing k-ifrs 1001 requirements.
      the amendments clarify:
      ■■ the materiality requirements in k-ifrs 1001

      ■■ that specific line items in the statement(s) of profit or loss and oci and the statement of financial position may be

         disaggregated
120   ■■ that entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present the notes to financial statements

      ■■ that the share of oci of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must be presented in

         aggregate as a single line item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently reclassi-
         fied to profit or loss

      furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the
      statement of financial position and the statement(s) of profit or loss and oci. these amendments are effective for
      annual periods beginning on or after january 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. these amendments are not
      expected to have any impact on the group.

      amendments to k-ifrs 1110, ifrs 12 and k-ifrs 1028 investment entities: applying the consolidation exception
      the amendments address issues that have arisen in applying the investment entities exception under k-ifrs 1110.
      the amendments to k-ifrs 1110 clarify that the exemption from presenting consolidated financial statements
      applies to a parent entity that is a subsidiary of an investment entity, when the investment entity measures all of its
      subsidiaries at fair value.

      furthermore, the amendments to k-ifrs 1110 clarify that only a subsidiary of an investment entity that is not
      an investment entity itself and that provides support services to the investment entity is consolidated. all other
      subsidiaries of an investment entity are measured at fair value. the amendments to k-ifrs 1028 allow the investor,
      when applying the equity method, to retain the fair value measurement applied by the investment entity associate
      or joint venture to its interests in subsidiaries. these amendments must be applied retrospectively and are effective
      for annual periods beginning on or after january 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. these amendments are not
      expected to have any impact on the group.

   on april 1, 2014, songwon industrial group – through its subsidiary songwon additive technologies ag – acquired
   an additional 25% economic interest in polysys additive technologies – middle east llc (patme-uae), an unlisted
   company based in abu dhabi, uae.

   after this acquisition, an assessment of the group’s power to control patme-uae led to the decision that the group
   will control the entity going forward. accordingly, patme-uae became a subsidiary of the parent company, while it
   was accounted for as a joint operation until march 31, 2014.

   the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired company are valued at fair value on the date of
   acquisition. if the cost exceeds the fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities,
   the balance is reported as goodwill.

   assets acquired and liabilities assumed
   the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at the date of acquisition were

      the intangible assets (except for goodwill and memberships) are amortized over a finite useful life. the goodwill
      items consist of items acquired in a business combination. in the 2015 financial year, no business combination took
      place that led to a capitalization of intangible assets.

      as a result of the business acquisition of sequent scientific limited, panoli, india by the group, intangible assets
      such as customer relationships (4,315 million krw), process technologies (4,028 million krw), as well as goodwill
      (3,463 million krw) were capitalized in the prior period. from the acquisition of patme-uae, abu dhabi, uae,
      goodwill of 115 million krw was capitalized in 2014.

      intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually. an impairment test was carried out
      for goodwill and membership items based on calculated value in use. for further details of the impairment test, see
      note 10.

     impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with

     indefinite lives

  10.1     impairment test on intangible assets with indefinite useful life

  goodwill acquired through business combinations and memberships with indefinite useful lives have been
  allocated to the cash-generating units (cgus) according to their business activities. goodwill acquired in a
  business combination is allocated to each cgu expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.
  the goodwill acquired during the acquisition of songwon holdings ag, songwon atg gmbh, polysys additive
  technologies, as well as memberships are allocated to the cgu comprising the acquired entities and the parent
  company, which correspond almost to the entire group. the goodwill resulting from the business acquisition of
  sequent scientific limited was allocated to the distinct cgu of songwon specialty chemicals – india pvt. ltd.,
  india (swci-in).

  the allocation of the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life to the cgus is as follows:

                                                                             december 31, 2015 december 31, 2014

  the group performed its annual impairment test in december 2015 and 2014. the recoverable amount of the cgus
  – to which goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated – has been determined based on its
  value in use, calculated using the discounted cash flow (dcf) model.

  as of december 31, 2015, the recoverable amount of the main cgu (rest of the group) equals 900,157 million krw
  (2014: 834,795 million krw). the recoverable amount of the cgu of songwon specialty chemicals – india pvt. ltd.,
  india amounts to 33,644 million krw or 1,889 million inr (2014: 24,138 million krw or 1,400 million inr).

  there is no impairment loss recognized during 2015 according to the impairment test on goodwill and
  memberships. as of the measurement date, the recoverable amount based on the value in use in 2015 exceeded the
  carrying amount of the relevant cgus.



  10.2     key assumptions used in calculation of value in use

  the calculation of the cgu value in use reflects the future cash flows for the next three years for the main cgu and
  for the next five years for swci-in discounted to the present value at the weighted average cost of capital (wacc)
  and at an estimated residual value. the projected cash flows are estimated based on the 2016 budget and 2016-
  2020 business plan, as approved by management, and mid-term assumptions. for the free cash flows extending
  beyond the detailed planning period, a terminal value was computed by capitalizing the normalized cash flows
  using a constant growth rate. the long-term growth rate is aligned to blended long-term inflation expectations for
  relevant countries.




                                                                              songwon annual financial & sustainability report 2015

      in addition, a market risk premium of 6.00% (2014: 5.00%) and a small cap premium of 3.74% (2014: 3.84%) were
      applied for the calculation of the wacc.

      the key assumptions underlying the calculation are as follows:

                                                        wacc is calculated using the capital asset pricing model (capm).
                                                        the latter comprises the weighted cost of own equity and of external

                                                        results in the same value in use.
                                                        long-term growth rate is calculated based on the expected inflation
      long-term growth rate
                                                        rates for currencies of relevant countries.

      investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market, and of which the fair
      value cannot be reliably measured, are measured at cost.

      impairment on available-for-sale financial investments
      for available-for-sale financial investments, the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective
      evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired. in the case of equity investments classified
      as available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the
      investment below its cost. based on these criteria, the group did not identify any impairment on available-for-sale
      investments as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.

      the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be
      exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
      the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
      ■■ cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, other receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities ap-

         proximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
      ■■ fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets, if availa-

         ble.
      ■■ fair value of unquoted available-for-sale financial assets is estimated using appropriate valuation techniques (see

         note 24.2.1).



      24.2.1 fair value hierarchy

      the group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by
      valuation technique:


      description        valuation technique
      level 1            quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
                         other techniques for which all inputs, which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value,
      level 2
                         are observable either directly, or indirectly

  during the reporting periods ending december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, there were no transfers between
  level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements.

  for the financial assets and financial liabilities for which the fair value is disclosed (see note 24.2), the carrying
  amount is a reasonable approximation of fair values and is measured using level 3 measurement methods, except
  for cash and cash equivalents.



  24.3     financial risk management objectives and policies

  the group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, and other
  financial liabilities. the main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the group’s operations. the group
  has trade accounts and other accounts receivables, cash and cash equivalents, as well as other financial assets
  that arrive directly from its operations. the group also holds available-for-sale investments, enters into derivative
  transactions and applies hedge accounting for cash flow hedges if applicable.

  the group is exposed to market, credit and liquidity risks. the group’s management oversees the management of
  these risks through appropriate risk assessment and monitoring activities to minimize their effects.




                                                                            songwon annual financial & sustainability report 2015

      24.3.1 market risk

      market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
      changes in market prices. market prices comprise two types of risk:
      ■■ interest rate risk

      ■■ foreign currency risk



      financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, available-for-sale
      investments and derivative financial instruments. the sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the
      positions at december 31, 2015 and 2014.

      interest rate risk
      interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
      of changes in market interest rates. the group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates
      primarily to its interest-bearing loans and borrowings, as well as bank deposits with floating interest rates.

      the group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates substantially to its interest-bearing loans
      and borrowings with floating interest rates, which makes the group exposed to cash flows risk. responsively, the
      group is minimizing the risk partially through interest rate swap contracts, or choosing the most favorable financing
      instruments by switching to the loans with more favorable conditions or improving the group’s credit rating.

      interest rate sensitivity
      the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates. the group’s
      exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the group’s interest-bearing loans and
150   borrowings, as well as bank deposits with floating interest rates. with all other variables held constant, the group’s
      profit before tax is affected by the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows:

                       increase / (decrease) in %         effect on profit before tax
                                                                        million krw

      2014                                       1.00                          -2,071
                                                -1.00                          2,071



      foreign currency risk
      the group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to its operating activities.
      the risk of foreign exchange primarily relates to the us dollar (usd), euro (eur), swiss franc (chf), japanese yen
      (jpy), uae dirham (aed) and the indian rupee (inr).

      foreign exchange risks arise when commercial transactions, recognized assets or liabilities are denominated in a
      currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.

      the objective of managing foreign currency risk is to maximize the value of the firm through minimizing the
      fluctuation of net profit and uncertainty arising from foreign currency fluctuation. to accomplish this, the group
      uses a strategy to accord the collection terms of receivables and payment terms of payables denominated in usd,
      considering the similar volume of exports and imports. with regard to eur and jpy, the group manages the risk
      through currency forward contracts.

  foreign currency sensitivity
  the group carries out a sensitivity analysis for the dominant foreign currencies: the us dollar (usd), euro (eur),
  swiss franc (chf), japanese yen (jpy), uae dirham (aed) and indian rupee (inr). the assumed possible currency
  fluctuations are based on historical observations and future prognoses. financial instruments are incorporated into
  calculations. the following table demonstrates the sensitivity of consolidated net profit before tax to a reasonably
  possible shift in exchange rates related to financial instruments held in the balance sheet. assuming that the other
  variables are constant, but only the foreign exchange rate changes by 10%, the impacts on net profit for the years
  ended on december 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:

  the group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.




  24.3.2 credit risk                                                                                                                  151
  credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer
  contract, leading to a financial loss. the group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for
  trade receivables) and investing activities.

  the group maintains a policy to only keep trade relationships with customers with a high credit rating assessed by
  credit assessment considering their financial position, past experience of defaults and other indicators of default.
  if a customer’s credit rating worsens, the group sets an individual credit limit on that customer and intensively
  manages the credit risk. in addition, the group minimizes the credit risk by maintaining its exposure at an
  insignificant level through ongoing management, including periodical reviews of all customers.

  the group is also exposed to credit risk with regard to bank deposits, as well as cash and cash equivalents in which
  the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value. the exposure to the related credit
  risk, however, is relatively restricted because the group maintains relationships with financial institutions with high
  credit ratings.



  24.3.3 liquidity risk

  liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial
  liabilities due to the unfavorable economy of the industry or financial market.

  the group manages its liquidity risk through its own strategy and plans, which consider the maturity of financial
  instruments and expected operating cash flows, and include a policy to map out the maturity of financial assets and
  liabilities.




                                                                              songwon annual financial & sustainability report 2015

           50 years leaping ahead in the world of polymers




      in addition, the group maintains credit facilities with the banks to respond to an unexpected shortage in liquidity.
      the group manages funding schedules and ongoing review procedures, considering the appropriate mix of long-
      term and short-term loans and borrowings, to maintain consistency and flexibility in obtaining liquidity and stable
      financing in response to expansion of the business.

      the details of the maturity profile of the group’s financial liabilities, excluding financial derivative instruments,
      based on contractual undiscounted payments as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (based on
      contractual undiscounted payments):

      24.3.4 capital management

      the capital managed by the group is identical to the total amount of equity presented in the consolidated statement
      of financial position. the primary objective of the group’s capital management is to ensure its continued ability to
      provide consistency for its equity shareholders through a combination of capital growth and distribution. to achieve
      this objective, the group monitors its gearing to balance risk and returns at an acceptable level, and maintains
      a sufficient funding base to enable the company to meet its working capital and strategic investment needs. to
      maintain or adjust the capital structure, the company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return
      capital to shareholders or issue new shares, considering not only the short-term position, but also its long-term
      operational and strategic objectives. at group level, the debt ratio is reviewed regularly. the debt-equity ratio as of
      december 31, 2015 and 2014 is 167% and 197%, respectively.

      all subsidiaries have to report key performance indicators, which also include capital management information,
      monthly.
