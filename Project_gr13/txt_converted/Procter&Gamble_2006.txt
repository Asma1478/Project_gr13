companies like p&g are a force in our world. of the world’s
100 largest economic entities, 42 are corporations.

the challenge is to ﬁgure out where and how a company like
p&g can make the most meaningful difference. we need to
ask ourselves how we can use our technologies, our human
capital and our global presence and experience to help ensure
a sustainable future for the people who need help and hope
the most. these are important questions because the best way
to ensure p&g efforts are sustainable is to link them to our
core capabilities and unique strengths.

today, we are focused on helping children in need live, learn and
thrive. our signature program is children’s safe drinking water.

organizational structure




organizational structure

we have an organizational structure composed of three global business
units (gbus) and a global operations group. the global operations group consists
of the market development organizations (mdos) and global business services (gbs). the
heads of the three gbus and global operations each report to the chief executive ofﬁcer.




global business units
our three gbus are beauty and health, household care and
gillette gbu.

the gbus leverage their consumer understanding to develop
overall strategy for our brands. they identify common
consumer needs, develop new products and build our brands
through effective marketing innovations.

global operations
the mdos develop go-to-market plans at the local level,
leveraging their understanding of the local consumer and
customer. mdos are organized along seven geographic
regions. (see next page for map.)

global business services
gbs operates as the “back ofﬁce” for the gbu and mdo
organizations, providing world-class technology, processes
and standard data tools to better understand the business
and better serve consumers and customers. gbs personnel, or
highly efﬁcient and effective third-party partners, provide   the mdo is focused on winning the “ﬁrst moment of truth”
these services.                                               – when a consumer stands in front of the shelf and chooses
                                                              a product from among many competitive offerings.




                                                              the gbu is focused on winning the “second moment
                                                              of truth” – when the consumer uses the product and

major acquisitions
on october 1, 2005, we completed acquisition of the gillette
company for approximately $53.43 billion. gillette is
a leading consumer products company that had $10.48 billion
in sales in its most recent pre-acquisition year ended
december 31, 2004.

the acquisition of gillette has added ﬁve billion-dollar brands
to p&g’s stable of 17 billion-dollar brands. it has more than
70 percent global market share of razors and blades, 40 percent
global market share in alkaline batteries and 36 percent share
of the global toothbrush market.

major divestitures
proceeds from asset sales in 2006 were $882 million, primarily
due to the divestitures of spinbrush, rembrandt and right
guard, all required by regulatory authorities in relation to the
gillette acquisition, and our korea paper businesses.




shareholders
there were approximately 2,086,000 common stock
shareowners, including shareholders of record, participants in
the shareholder investment program, participants in the p&g
stock ownership plans, and beneﬁcial owners with accounts at

p&g’s presence in a community makes a valuable economic contribution.
the company and its employees pay taxes and purchase goods and
services. the sale of p&g products generates employment for retailers, distributors, raw
materials suppliers, advertising agencies, etc. the company and its employees are known
for their philanthropy.




economic development
innovation is a p&g cornerstone. more than $1.8 billion is
invested annually in research and development – the largest
amount among consumer product companies worldwide. we
have more than 36,000 patents worldwide, and we average
more than one new patent per day.

these intellectual assets are of tremendous value to p&g. but
some are not being fully realized; we invent more than we can
commercialize. through our external business development
group, we continue to identify non-strategic proprietary
technologies which, when developed to their full potential,
can yield sustainable revenue sources and bring important
technologies to the market.

p&g invites collaboration. our external business development
group manages over 800 active contracts with other
companies and institutions. this includes a wide variety of deal

employee enthusiasm grows
for children’s safe drinking water
p&g employees coming to lunch at the brussels innovation
center on world water day found jugs of dirty, brown water
on the cafeteria tables instead of the customary jugs of clean
water. the jugs were labeled “more than 1 billion people have
only this to drink!”

employee volunteers came around offering clean water,
soliciting “tips” to buy pur for a ugandan medical center.
the point of this event was to raise awareness of drinking
water issues in the developing world and p&g’s efforts to
help. african food was on the menu, and a gambian musician
played djembe music. demonstrations showed employees how
pur works.

the event raised about 2,500 euros (us$3,034) from
employees. the brussels innovation center matched that
amount. funds raised went to the belgian ngo kids for
uganda, which bought pur at cost for young children and          ronald helps p&g’s uk/ireland employees understand

environmental protection
the very nature of producing and using products causes p&g and
consumers to use resources and to generate wastes and emissions.
p&g is committed to reducing or preventing this whenever possible.




                                             p&g’s philosophy is grounded in a belief
                                             that we should be a leader in our industry
                                             in implementing our global environmental
                                             program. to do this, we concentrate on
                                             environmental innovation and accountability
                                             for results. we believe our accomplishments
                                             illustrate this commitment.

                                             for example, p&g was ﬁrst to bring
                                             innovations such as concentrated products,
                                             reﬁll packages and recycled plastic bottles to
                                             our industry. we have made great strides in
                                             reducing overall packaging per case by an
                                             average of 27 percent since 1990. during
                                             the same period, our focus on pollution
                                             prevention has resulted in a 65-percent
                                             reduction in waste and in air and water
                                             emissions from our manufacturing plants.

                                             we recognize that environmental progress is
                                             a never-ending journey of continuous effort
                                             and improvement. by focusing on improving

p&g joins campaign to reduce
detergent impact in europe
p&g continues to expand its sustainability achievements in          the compacting of traditional detergents to 95 grams per wash
detergents: the company recently joined a two-year european         led to a 36-percent decrease in the weight of powder needed
campaign to reduce the amount of detergent used, particularly       per wash and a 23-percent drop in the amount of packaging
in central and eastern europe, where consumers typically            used, compared to 1997. additionally, fully compacted

detergent used in central and eastern europe by nearly
200,000 tonnes.

the international detergent association a.i.s.e. (the association
internationale de la savonnerie, de la détergence et des
produits d’entretien) launched the initiative in january 2006,
and p&g has implemented it in 10 countries, with another nine
countries pending. this initiative includes:
• reducing the environmental impact of laundry detergents by
  reducing chemicals, packaging and energy used in product
  manufacturing, delivery and use. this includes reducing by
  a minimum of 33 percent (in weight) the recommended
  dosage for a standard washing machine load. also, reducing
  the dose for a standard washing machine load by a minimum
  of 25 percent (in volume).
• encouraging consumers to modify the way they use                                                        p&g continues to compact

  used while maintaining cleanliness standards.                                                           reduce their packaging.

a noticeable beneﬁt for consumers is that detergent packages
are becoming smaller and lighter.

the current campaign builds on previous efforts by p&g and
the detergent industry to compact detergents over the past
decade. p&g has been working with a.i.s.e. in western europe
since the early ’90s to compact detergents, thereby using less
raw material and less packaging and putting less chemical
material into the environment.

in the early ’90s, it was difﬁcult to convince consumers to
accept compact detergents that required only 75 grams per
wash instead of the traditional 150 grams. so in 1997 p&g
and the a.i.s.e. started compacting detergents in 18 european
countries from 150 grams down to 95 grams. this was a four-
step, progressive process over eight years. the new campaign
is scheduled to achieve its goals in one compaction step
instead of four.

mataró’s wastewater efforts
help local environment
spain’s mataró plant did a lot of work this year regarding
wastewater reduction and treatment and also water consumption.

the plant set up a new, activated carbon wastewater
treatment unit. this unit cleans wastewater so well that it
complies with the very strict requirements for river discharge,
even though the wastewater gets discharged into a public
sewage system. the surfactants concentration decreased up to
50 fold – typically from 150 parts per million down to 3.

in addition, four of the plant’s seven departments are now
“zero efﬂuent” departments.

awareness training
awareness training was launched in october 2004 and
continued during 2005. we are using a web-based portal,
weekly e-mailed curricula and special campaigns to educate
employees. the campaigns focus on special events (e.g.,
world aids day, the christmas season, valentine’s day,
women’s day and world tb day), and the portal provides all
employees with access to more than 1,300 pages of
hiv/aids information.

surveys
we have surveyed employees twice. in 2004 we assessed our
employees’ hiv vulnerability by exploring their knowledge,
attitude and practices (kap). in 2005 we conducted an
anonymous prevalence survey to determine the number of
employees who are hiv-positive.

friends for life
to help the thousands of pets left homeless by hurricanes in
2005, iams established the iams friends for life fund at the
greater cincinnati foundation. the fund raised nearly $60,000
for nonproﬁt organizations that cared for the pets, reuniting
them with their families where possible, or ﬁnding them new
homes. in addition, iams donated more than 200,000 pounds
of dog and cat food to shelters in the affected areas.

iams will continue the friends for life fund permanently,
with the mission of “bringing together people and pets for a
lifetime of health, happiness and love.”

iams is also continuing its other efforts to ﬁnd homes for
orphan pets. the annual iams home 4 the holidays adoption

teaching kids to care
about animals
iams is partnering with operation outreach-usa, a nonproﬁt
organization that improves children’s literacy skills while
teaching respect for living things. iams donates books about
interactions between people and animals. each child receives
two books to use in the classroom and then take home.

this program reaches third-graders and their teachers in
61 schools. over nine years, the program has reached nearly
52,000 schoolchildren. it operates in ﬁve states where iams has
facilities as well as in new york city. this year, the program will
add involvement by iams employees and local animal shelters.

“students and teachers have all learned what it is to truly
give care and protection to our animal friends,” says one
teacher. “an additional beneﬁt to this program is the increased
sensitivity our children now have to the importance of being
kind to animals and each other as well.”

operation outreach-usa focuses on literacy, academic
achievement and the building blocks of strong character.
