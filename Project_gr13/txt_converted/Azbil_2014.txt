                                                   “human-centered automation.”




since our establishment in 1906, we have focused on measurement and control technologies, delivering unique
solutions to our customers. our evolution having taken us from the idea of controlling machines to the idea
of creating fulfillment for people, we now strive to realize work styles and lifestyles that give people a sense of
safety, comfort, and fulfillment as well as to contribute to benefit the global environment in our quest for
“human-centered automation.”
  under this philosophy, during the last period, we set long-term targets, net sales of ¥300.0 billion, operating in-
come of ¥30.0 billion or higher, and roe of 10% or higher to be achieved by the year ending march 2022. as the
first step in this process, we established a four-year medium-term plan, which will take us through the year ending
march 2017, the 110th anniversary of the company’s founding. guided by plan, we have been advancing our opera-
tions based on three initiatives as follows:
1. becoming a long-term partner for the customer and the community by offering solutions based on our technolo-
  gies and products
2. taking global operations to the next level, with global expansion by moving into new regions and making a qualita-
  tive change of focus
3. becoming a corporate organization that never stops learning, so that it can continuously strengthen its corporate
  structure
  today, the azbil group focuses on new market needs of energy management, safety, and peace of mind in its three
core business segments: building automation, advanced automation, and life automation. adhering to this strat-
egy, we are targeting steady growth while pursuing reforms to address the rapidly changing business environment.
  for the year ended march 31, 2014, the japanese economy finally showed signs, though modest in scale, of end-
ing its prolonged deflationary period. furthermore, the decision to award the 2020 summer olympics to tokyo will
provide a huge boost for the japanese government’s growth strategy, known as “abenomics.” in response, we will
closely monitor the changing business environment and adopt a global perspective in both domestic and overseas
operations. working close with customers, we will strive to give them new levels of value and resolve a broad range
of issues. we will forge ahead as a unified corporate group that contributes to sustained progress for the customer
and society.

          azbil’s history of value creation

               for more than a century, the azbil group has achieved
               sustainable growth in harmony with society, by continuing
               to pursue automation and always providing value
               that meets the needs of the age.
               since our founding in 1906, we have taken on the challenge of solving problems
               in a variety of situations and locations, including buildings, factories and plants,                                                                    1985

               lifelines, and households, making use of the most advanced automation technol-
               ogy available and our accumulated knowledge. by continuing to respond to the
               needs of society and new needs that have emerged at a range of sites over more
               than a century, we have always created new value and achieved sustainable
               growth, even amid harsh environments in which we have been subject to numer-
               ous external pressures, including the collapse of the economic bubble and the
               lehman shock financial crisis.                                                                                                          1985

  in the year under review, sales in the life automation business amounted to ¥49.6 billion, up 45.9% from the previous year.
  this was attributable to the inclusion of azbil telstar and its subsidiaries in the scope of consolidation. despite improved
  profitability in the gas and water meter field, we reported a segment loss of ¥0.7 billion, from ¥0.4 billion in the previous
  year. this was due to costs associated with reinforcing and expanding our business foundation and the effect of consolida-

 reducing the environmental impact of society through our businesses
 the azbil group helps to reduce the environmental impact of society through the products and solutions it provides. for the year ended
 march 31, 2014, we calculated the effect of our businesses in reducing co2 emissions at our customers’ sites. the total co2 reduction
 for the year under review comes to 2,810 thousand tons, equivalent to about one 500th of the approximately 1.3 billion tons emitted
 during the year in japan.
 note: for the calculations, we categorized co2 data into three areas—reduction resulting from automation, from energy management, and from maintenance

  community initiatives

 in 2011, the azbil group formalized its participation in environ-
 mental conservation activities in two localities by signing agree-
 ments with the city of fujisawa in kanagawa prefecture, where
 the company’s fujisawa technology center (ftc) is located, and
 with the town of minamiaizu in fukushima prefecture, where
 azbil kimmon aizu co., ltd., is located.
   in a “green zone” in fujisawa, employees from ftc and else-
 where have engaged in activities such as thinning a wooded
 area and making a walking path under the guidance of fujisawa
 green staff, a local non-profit organization, in order to make
 it easier for local residents to enjoy the natural environment.
                                                                      azbil kyoto’s building at the
   minamiaizu is well-known as a place where clusters of hime-        time of its completion (1996)
 sayuri, or maiden lilies, grow. this plant is designated as a
 near-threatened species on the red list of the ministry of the
 environment of japan. to preserve the maiden lily, azbil group
 employees help to sow seeds and plant bulbs.

    azbil corporation is working to perfect a governance framework
     that ensures highly fair, neutral, and transparent management.
               we have built a system that facilitates the prompt implementation of policy initiatives by
   separating decision making by the board of directors from the actual execution of company policy by
                            executive officers. in addition, highly independent outside directors provide
        oversight of the company’s management and execution of business, helping to raise the level of
                                   fairness, neutrality, and transparency in the company’s management.

                       as is customary in japan, the azbil group maintains deposit balances with banks with which it has bank loans. such deposit balances are
                       not legally or contractually restricted as to withdrawal.
                         general agreements with respective banks provide, as is customary in japan, that additional collateral must be provided under certain
                       circumstances if requested by the lending banks and that certain banks have the right to offset cash deposited with them against any bank
                       loan or obligation that becomes due and, in case of default and certain other specified events, against all other debt payable to the banks.
                       the azbil group has never received any such requests.

                       plans for directors and audit & supervisory board members.
                         under most circumstances, employees terminating their employment are entitled to retirement benefits determined based on the rate
                       of pay at the time of termination, years of service, and certain other factors. such retirement benefits are made in the form of lump-sum

                       there is no material difference between the normal effective statutory tax rate for the year ended march 31, 2013, and the actual effective
                       tax rate reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.
                         new tax reform laws enacted in 2014 in japan changed the normal effective statutory tax rate for the fiscal year beginning on or after
                       april 1, 2014, from approximately 37.9% to 35.5%. the effect of this change was to decrease deferred tax assets in the consolidated
                       balance sheet as of march 31, 2014, by ¥457 million ($4,435 thousand) and to increase income taxes—deferred in the consolidated state-
                       ment of income for the year then ended by ¥457 million ($4,435 thousand).
                         at march 31, 2014, certain subsidiaries have tax loss carryforwards aggregating approximately ¥10,924 million ($106,044 thousand) which are
                       available to be offset against taxable income of such subsidiaries in future years. these tax loss carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire as follows:

      asbj statement no. 13, “accounting standard for lease transactions,” requires that all finance lease transactions be capitalized to
    recognize lease assets and lease obligations in the balance sheet. however, asbj statement no. 13 permits leases without ownership
    transfer of the leased property to the lessee and whose lease inception was before march 31, 2008, to continue to be accounted for
    as operating lease transactions if certain “as if capitalized” information is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. azbil and
    its consolidated domestic subsidiaries applied asbj statement no. 13 effective april 1, 2008, and accounted for such leases as oper-
    ating lease transactions. pro forma information of leased property whose lease inception was before march 31, 2008, was as follows:

                           the azbil group leases certain machinery and equipment as a lessor.
                             azbil and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries applied asbj statement no. 13 effective april 1, 2008, and accounted for leases
                           which existed at the transition date and which do not transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee as operating lease
                           transactions. pro forma information of such leases existing at the transition date, such as receivables under the finance leases, on an

                       15. financial instruments and related disclosures
                       (1) policy for financial instruments
                           the azbil group makes safety the first priority in terms of its asset management and limits its investments to financial assets that
                           consist mainly of short-term deposits, while the azbil group’s financing needs are met by selecting the most suitable method of
                           funding while taking into account such factors as the purpose of the loan, the terms and funding costs. the azbil group limits the
                           use of derivatives to forward exchange contracts and currency option contracts to hedge against the risks associated with fluctuating
                           exchange rates, and interest rate swaps to hedge against the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates, and does not engage in
                           transactions for speculative purposes.

                       (2) nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments and risk management
                           notes and accounts receivable—trade are subject to the credit risks of the customers. the azbil group manages its credit risks on
                           the basis of internal guidelines, which include keeping track of due dates and outstanding balances of the receivables for each
                           transaction and also monitors the credit standing of the major customers on a yearly basis. notes and accounts receivable—trade
                           denominated in foreign currencies are subject to risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates; however, their net positions after
                           deducting operating liabilities are, in principle, hedged through the use of forward exchange contracts.
                             investment securities mainly comprise stocks of companies with which the azbil group has business relationships, and are subject
                           to the risks associated with fluctuating stock prices. such stock investments are managed by monitoring their fair values and the
                           financial status of the companies on a regular basis, as well as conducting ongoing reviews of their holding status by taking into ac-
                           count the azbil group’s relationship with the issuing companies.
                             notes and accounts payable—trade are liabilities due within one year. although certain notes and accounts payable—trade de-
                           nominated in foreign currencies are subject to the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, the majority of such instruments
                           are constantly kept within the amount of the outstanding balance of accounts receivable denominated in the same foreign currency.
                             interest-bearing debt mainly comprises short-term borrowings. while a portion of these borrowings, having floating interest rates,
                           is subject to the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates, the effects of these risks are negligible as their terms are short and
                           amounts minimal.




82 azbil report 2014

          derivative transactions are executed and managed in accordance with internal rules that have determined the authorization pro-
        cedures of such transactions, are used for the purpose of mitigating credit risks, and are conducted solely with highly rated financial
        institutions as counterparties. please see note 16 for more detail about derivatives.
          additionally, notes and accounts payable—trade and short-term borrowings are subject to liquidity risks such as in the event the
        azbil group cannot execute payment on the payment date. liquidity risks are managed by such methods as having each group com-
        pany draw up monthly cash flow plans.

    fair values of financial instruments are based on quoted prices in active markets. if a quoted price is not available, other rational valu-
    ation techniques are used instead. also please see note 16 for the detail of fair value for derivatives.

                       16. derivatives
                       the azbil group enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with trade receivables and pay-
                       ables denominated in foreign currencies. the azbil group also enters into interest rate swap contracts to manage its interest rate exposures
                       on certain liabilities.
                         it is the azbil group’s policy to use derivatives only for the purpose of reducing market risks associated with assets and liabilities, not to
                       hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
                         since all of the azbil group’s foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts are related to qualified hedges of un-
                       derlying business exposures, market gain or loss risk in the derivative instruments is effectively offset by opposite movements in the value
                       of the hedged assets or liabilities.
                         because the counterparties to these derivatives are limited to major international financial institutions, the azbil group does not antici-
                       pate any losses arising from credit risk.
                         derivative transactions entered into by the azbil group have been made in accordance with internal policies which regulate the autho-
                       rization and credit limit amounts.

                       information on the foreign currency forward contacts for the years ended march 31, 2014 and 2013, is not disclosed as the amounts are
                       not material.
                       note: the above interest rate swaps which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid
                             or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expense or income. in addition, the fair value of such interest rate swaps in note 7
                             is included in that long-term debt.

                       the fair value of derivative transactions is measured at the quoted price obtained from the financial institution.
                        the contract or notional amounts of derivatives which are shown in the above table do not represent the amounts exchanged by the
                       parties and do not measure the azbil group’s exposure to credit or market risk.

(1) description of reportable segments                                     significant accounting policies.”
    the reportable segments of the azbil group—identifiable op-
    erating segments of the group’s business structure for which
    financial information is made separately available—are sub-
    ject to periodic review by the board of directors in order to
    make decisions on the distribution of management resources
    and to assess performance.
      the azbil group identifies its operating segments using
    such criteria as business organization, product lines, service
    content, and markets. this approach results in three sepa-
    rate reportable segments: the building automation (ba) busi-
    ness, the advanced automation (aa) business, and the life
    automation (la) business.
