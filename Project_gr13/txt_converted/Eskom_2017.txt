health dashboard, number6

1. calculated figures based on coal characteristics and power station design parameters based on coal analysis and using coal burnt tonnages.
   figures include coal-fired and gas turbine power stations, as well as oil consumed during power station start-ups and, for carbon dioxide emissions,
   includes the underground coal gasification pilot plant.
2. no x reported as no2 is calculated using average station-specific emission factors (which are measured intermittently) and tonnages of coal burnt.
3. volume of water consumed per unit of generated power sent out by commissioned power stations.
4. the limit set by the national nuclear regulator is ≤0,25msv.
5. the gross mass of a nuclear fuel element is approximately 670kg, with uo2 mass, typically between 462kg and 464kg.
6. reported in terms of the 2002 definition of the operational health dashboard. from 2008, repeat legal contraventions are included.
