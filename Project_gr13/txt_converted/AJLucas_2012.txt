 during the year, significant improvement in lucas'
 safety procedures ensured the company's drilling
 division was able to achieve a positive and rewarding
 result in its safety performance. using industry-
 standard measures, lucas drilling achieved a 9.3%
 improvement in its 12 month rolling total recordable
 incident frequency rate ð a reduction from 16.2 in
 july 2011 to 14.7 in june 2012. these positive results
 exemplify the success of programs, forums and other
 strategic approaches implemented throughout the
 year to increase the focus on, and commitment to
 our stringent safety procedures.
 while this is a significant achievement, lucas
 continues to seek further improvements in all safety
 metrics across all areas of the business.

projects recently undertaken include the mayfield to
broadmeadow waste water upgrade as well as connection
to mains sewerage of rural communities in robertson,
located in the southern highlands of new south wales,
kangaroo valley and the towns of burringbar and mooball,
located in the tweed valley of northern new south wales.
works undertaken on these projects include the installation
of an advanced wastewater treatment system, also known
as a membrane bioreactor, with a consequent reduction in
pollution risk to the local drinking water catchment area.


telecommunications
the marais-lucas joint venture is also enjoying increasing
recognition for its network installation capability, particularly
for the ultra fast broadband (ufb) fibre optic roll out in new
zealand, where it has been selected as a preferred supplier
to chorus, one of four companies contracted to implement
the ufb roll out. capable of installing upwards of 400 metres
per day with minimal surface disturbance, marais-lucas
recently completed 10km of trenching connecting
over 600 homes.
the marais-lucas micro-trenching capability is also gaining
increasing recognition in australia. the company has
recently been awarded a 25km project by etsa for the
installation of fibre optic cable at mt gambier in south
australia. the company will shortly take delivery of a
specialist trencher capable of simultaneously cutting the
trench, feeding in the pipe or fibre optic and backfilling in
one pass. this creates much less surface disturbance, causes
less disruption to passing traffic and considerably decreases
delivery time.

     analysis of the flow
     data from fracks
     conducted in april and
     may 2011 suggests the
     very large hydrocarbon
     resource, currently
     estimated at 200tcf,
     will most probably flow
     at commercial rates.
                                                                      cuadrilla has also used this period to appoint new senior

     at lancashire.                                                   is aimed at strengthening leadership and enabling them to
                                                                      build a 'fit for purpose' company.
     limited progress was made during the year to confirm the
     reserves within the bowland basin due to suspension of
     fracking throughout the period.
     despite this, continued preparatory work was carried out
     in anticipation of the uk department of energy and climate
     change (decc) allowing the resumption of fracking at some
     stage. wells at grange hill no. 1 and becconsall no. 1 were
     completed and another well has been spudded at anna's
     road. an application has also been made to drill a horizontal
     well at anna's road. the completed wells encountered
     much thicker shale, in excess of 3,000 feet, than originally
     anticipated.
     a 3d seismic program over 125 sq km of the north and north-
     west part of the bowland basin has been undertaken, and
     will provide further scientific evidence to unlock the basin's
     geological secrets.
     analysis of the limited flow data from fracks conducted in
     april and may 2011 suggests the very large hydrocarbon
     resource, currently estimated at 200tcf gas in place, will
     most probably flow at commercial rates. however, further
     fracking of the wells is required to more fully estimate the
     size and commercial viability of this resource.
     assuming permission is granted to recommence hydraulic
     fracturing of the wells, cuadrilla has proposed a number of
     checks and balances to mitigate and manage seismic activity,
     fracture gradients, water management, traffic control and
     ensure "state-of-the-art", best practice methodology in
     proving up what could be a very significant resource which
     may change the socio-economic prospects of lancashire.

world class systems
our new integrated
erp system will enable
lucas to achieve its
goal of providing the
highest quality service
to our customers and
enhance relationships
with suppliers.


lucas now has world class systems and processes following
the recent completion of the implementation of its oracle
enterprise resource planning (erp) system. the system,
with fully integrated functionalities including project
management, asset management, inventory management,
human resource management, payroll, procurement and
financial management, places the company on an equal
footing with companies of a much larger size.
the implementation of the new system will significantly
streamline the group's operations through the
decommissioning of six legacy systems. this will greatly
improve productivity but most importantly radically improve
business intelligence. daily information will now be available
to management, allowing better and more informed decision
making, improved allocation and management of resources,
and materially reduced wastage.
the new system also allows integration of the group's
tendering and project management thereby allowing
earlier identification of problem contracts and their quicker
rectification. the improved cost reporting is of great
importance to our clients, lifts their confidence in our
capability to deliver projects and should lead to the award
of a greater volume of work.
the new integrated system, together with our customer
relationship management (crm) system, will enable lucas
to achieve our goal of providing the highest quality service
to our customers and enhance our relationship with
our suppliers.
lucas will continue to build on its strong information
technology foundation with numerous further
improvements to be introduced in due course.

     review and results of operations
     overview of the group
     difficult trading conditions and lack of working capital resulted in the group recording a very disappointing result despite revenue
     increasing by 16.4% to $504.3 million from $433.4 million in the previous financial year.
     underlying ebitda decreased by 79.3% from $17.0 million to $3.5 million. however, balance sheet restructuring costs and
     contract provisioning reduced the reported ebitda to a loss of $21.5 million.
     the following table summarises the results for the year:

relationship of remuneration to company performance
in considering the group's performance and benefits for shareholder wealth, the remuneration committee has had regard
to the following indices in respect of the current financial year and the previous four financial years.

the overall level of key management personnel compensation has been constrained due to the performance of the group over
a number of years. no new incentive-based remuneration was granted during the year.
with the exception of two modest bonuses paid in rights, there has been no performance-related remuneration for kmp during
the 2011-12 year. these bonuses took account of the performance of the individuals during the year.
given that company performance has been disappointing, it is considered by the board to be appropriate that most executives
did not receive any bonus and the amounts received by the two executives who did were considered nominal.

(1) lucas has a 10% net profit interest (npi) in oil and gas leasehold interests in the monument prospect ("the prospect") located
    in trinity country, east texas, usa. the investment represents a contractual right to future income streams and has therefore
    been classified as an intangible asset within the scope of aasb 138 intangible assets. no recent exploratory drilling has been
    conducted at the prospect and the company has therefore been unable to prepare a discounted cash flow analysis to support
    its carrying value. accordingly, the investment has been fully impaired. future exploration and evaluation activity may allow
    an assessment of future cash flows to be performed and a reassessment made of the carrying value.

employee share plan

the group has three employee incentive schemes that were approved by shareholders in annual general meetings.
total securities granted but unissued under these schemes cannot exceed 15% of the total number of shares on issue.


a) management rights plan: the management rights and options plan is available to employees, directors and other
persons at the discretion of the board. nominated persons are granted rights to acquire shares in the company. the exercise
of rights is satisfied by the issue of shares for no consideration. the exercise of options is satisfied by the exercise price as agreed.
no rights or options were issued during the year.
the number and weighted average exercise prices of rights and options at balance date are as follows:

the options outstanding at 30 june 2012 have an exercise price in the range of $nil to $2.11 (2011: $nil to $2.11) and a weighted
average contractual life of 0.6 years (2011: 0.9 years).
during the financial year, 444,314 share options were exercised (2011: 819,536) and 550,000 lapsed (2011: 38,685). the weighted
average share price at the dates of exercise was $1.05 (2011: $1.76).
during the year, the group recognised as an expense $291,824 (2011: $130,005) in relation to share based payments. the liability
at year end for cash settled rights is $554,418 (2011: $404,418). all rights holders electing to exercise their rights entitlements
during the year were settled by acquiring shares. no rights were exercised and settled by cash.
the fair value of the rights granted in previous years has been calculated using a black-scholes pricing model and allocated
to each reporting period evenly over the period from grant date to vesting date. the value disclosed is the portion of the fair value
of the rights allocated to this reporting period.
the following factors and assumptions were used in determining the fair value of rights on grant date for those share-based
payments granted in previous years:

                                      share price                                                            expected

b) deferred share plan: the deferred share plan (dsp) is available to chosen directors, including non-executives,
and employees to allow them to take a part of their annual remuneration in the form of shares in the company. shares vest
from the date of issue but cannot be disposed of until the earlier of 10 years from the date of issue or the date their employment
or service with the group ceases. no shares were issued in either of the last two years.
c) employee share acquisition plan: the employee share acquisition plan (esap) is available to all eligible employees
to acquire ordinary shares in the company for no consideration as a bonus component of their remuneration. the esap complies
with current australian tax legislation, enabling permanent employees to have up to $1,000 of free shares per annum, in respect
of an employee share scheme, excluded from their assessable income.
employees must have been employed by any entity within the group for a minimum period of one year to be eligible. shares issued
under the esap rank equally with other fully paid ordinary shares including full voting and dividend rights from the date they vest.
no consideration for the shares is receivable from the employees.
shares are issued in the name of the participating employee and vest from the date of issue. however, they cannot be disposed
of until the earlier of three years from the date of issue or the date their employment with the group ceases. the board has the
discretion to vary this restriction. the esap has no conditions that could result in a recipient forfeiting ownership of shares.
no shares were issued under this plan in either of the last two years.

30. financial instruments
overview

the group's activities expose it to the following risks from their use of financial instruments:
  credit risk;
  liquidity risk;
  market risk (including currency and interest rate risks); and
  operational risk.


risk management framework

the board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework.
the board has established the audit and risk committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring risk management
policies. the committee reports regularly to the board of directors on its activities.
risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly
to reflect changes in market conditions and the group's activities. the group, through its training and management standards and
procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles
and obligations.
the audit and risk committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the group's risk management policies
and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the group.


credit risk

credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or the counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group's receivables from customers.
trade and other receivables: the group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics
of each customer. the group's customer base consists of mainly government, semi-government and major public company
customers. the demographics of the group's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and location in which
the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
new customers are analysed individually for creditworthiness, taking into account credit ratings where available,
financial position, past experience and other factors. this includes all major contracts and tenders approved by the
tender review committee.

     in monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped by operating segment, then by their receivable ageing profile.
     ongoing monitoring of receivable balances minimises exposure to bad debts.
     a provision for impairment is recognised when there is objective evidence that an individual trade receivable is impaired.
     investments: the group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities of short maturity issued
     by a reputable party or in readily marketable securities listed on a recognisable securities exchange. given these investment
     criteria, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
     guarantees: group policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures where
     the company owns 50% of the joint venture company.
     exposure to credit risk: the carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
     the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:

     impairment allowance: the impairment allowance is related to specific customers, identified as being in trading difficulties,
     or where specific debts are in dispute. the impairment allowance does not include debts past due relating to customers with
     a good credit history, or where payments of amounts due under a contract for such customers are delayed due to works in dispute
     and previous experience indicated that the amount will be paid in due course.
     when the group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible, the amounts considered irrecoverable are written
     off directly against the financial asset. at 30 june 2012, the group has collective impairments on its trade receivables of $2,401,000
     (2011: $49,000) and non-current other receivables of $3,919,000 (2011: $3,919,000). the impairment of the non-current receivable
     relates to a provisions held against receivables which the group do not expect to recover.

liquidity risk

liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. liquidity is managed
to ensure, as far as possible, that sufficient funds are available to meet liabilities when they fall due, under both normal
and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the group's reputation.
the following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact
of netting arrangements:

     market risk

     market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect
     the group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. the objective of market risk management is to manage
     and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
     currency risk: the group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are
     denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of group entities, primarily with respect to the us dollar.
     the group's major foreign currency exposure relates to sales of services and purchases of raw materials, consumables and
     equipment and investments in oil and gas prospects. the group has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets
     are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. currency exposure arising from the net assets of the group's foreign operations
     is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
     the group's executive team actively monitors foreign currency exposures and where appropriate establishes financial instruments
     which ensure that sound management of currency risk is maintained.

     exposure to currency risk
     the group's exposure to foreign currency risk at balance date was as follows, based on notional amounts in australian dollars
     (in thousands):
                                               euro             usd            xpf          nzd           hkd            gbp               cad

interest rate risk: the group's main interest rate risk arises from borrowings. borrowings issued at variable rates expose the
group to cash flow interest rate risk. borrowings at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk. the group entered
into interest rate hedges in prior financial years to cap exposure to increases in interest rate volatility.

                                                                                                                2012                2011

fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
the group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, therefore a change
in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss for the group.


cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or loss
by $2,990,865 for the group (2011: $1,619,092). this analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates,
remain constant. the analysis is performed consistently from year to year.

       loans and borrowings, and finance leases ð present value of future principal and interest cash flow, discounted at the market
       rate of interest at the reporting date
       trade and other receivables and payables ð carrying amount equals fair value


     capital management: the board policy is to maintain a capital base so as to maximise shareholder returns having regard also
     to the need to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. the board seeks
     to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and
     security afforded by a sound capital position. the group's target is to achieve a return on capital of between 12% and 16%.
     in comparison, the weighted average interest expense on interest-bearing borrowings (excluding liabilities with imputed interest)
     was 8.76% (2011: 10.6%).
     the board's target is for employees (excluding directors) of the group to hold 4% of the company's ordinary shares by 2014.
     at present, employees hold approximately 2.5% of the company's ordinary shares, or just under 3% assuming that all outstanding
     share rights vest and are exercised. management is considering structures for extending the group's employee share schemes beyond
     key management and other senior employees.
     subsequent to balance date, shareholders have approved a placement of shares to kerogen to raise $30 million and the exercise
     of options over shares in the company by kerogen for a further $10 million, in aggregate raising $40 million in new equity
     for the company. refer to note 40 for further details.
     the group's debt to adjusted capital ratio at the end of the reporting period was as follows:

the different levels have been defined as follows:
  level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
					 (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)

33. contingencies and commitments
contingencies

the directors are of the opinion that provisions are not required in respect of the following matters, as it is not probable that
a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required or the amount is not capable of reliable measurement.
(i)		   under the joint venture agreements (see note 31), the relevant aj lucas group company is jointly and severally liable for
		      all the liabilities incurred by the joint ventures. as at 30 june 2012, the assets of the joint venture were sufficient to meet such
		      liabilities. the liabilities of the joint ventures not included in the consolidated financial statements amounted to $11,795,000
		      (2011: $3,341,000).
(ii)    during the normal course of business, entities within the group may incur contractor's liability in relation to their
		      performance obligations for specific contracts. such liability includes the potential costs to carry out further works and/or
		      litigation by or against those group entities. provision is made for the potential costs of carrying out further works based
		      on known claims and previous claims history, and for legal costs where litigation has been commenced. while the ultimate
		      outcome of these claims cannot be reliably determined at the date of this report, based on previous experience, amounts
		      specifically provided, and the circumstances of specific claims outstanding, no additional costs are anticipated.
(iii) under the terms of the class order described in note 38, the company has entered into approved deeds of indemnity
		 for the cross-guarantee of liabilities with participating australian subsidiary companies.


commitments

at 30 june 2012, the group had commitments contracted but not provided for and payable within one year of $3,942,732
(2011: $nil) for the purchase of new plant and equipment under finance leases.

     independent auditor's report to the members of aj lucas group limited
     report on the financial report

     we have audited the accompanying financial report of aj lucas group limited (the company), which comprises the consolidated
     statement of financial position as at 30 june 2012, and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement
     of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended on that date, notes 1 to 40 comprising a summary
     of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information and the directors' declaration of the group comprising the
     company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to time during the financial year.


     directors' responsibility for the financial report
     the directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view
     in accordance with australian accounting standards and the corporations act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors
     determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that is free from material misstatement whether due
     to fraud or error. in note 2(a), the directors also state, in accordance with australian accounting standard aasb 101 presentation
     of financial statements, that the financial statements of the group comply with international financial reporting standards.


     auditor's responsibility
     our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with
     australian auditing standards. these auditing standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements relating
     to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial report is free from
     material misstatement.
     an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial report.
     the procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
     financial report, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant
     to the entity's preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are
     appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal
     control. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
     estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
     we performed the procedures to assess whether in all material respects the financial report presents fairly, in accordance with the
     corporations act 2001 and australian accounting standards, a true and fair view which is consistent with our understanding of the
     group's financial position and of its performance.
     we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.


     independence
     in conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the corporations act 2001.


     auditor's opinion
     in our opinion:
     (a) the financial report of the group is in accordance with the corporations act 2001, including:
     		 (i)		 giving a true and fair view of the group's financial position as at 30 june 2012 and of its performance for the year ended
     				 on that date; and
     		 (ii) complying with australian accounting standards and the corporations regulations 2001.
     (b) the financial report also complies with international financial reporting standards as disclosed in note 2(a).

emphasis of matter regarding continuation as a going concern
without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to note 2 (c) in the financial report which indicates that the group incurred
a loss after income tax of $110.2 million during the year ended 30 june 2012, and, as of that date, the group's current liabilities
exceeded its current assets by $131.0 million.
these conditions along with other matters set forth in note 2(c), indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which
may cast significant doubt about the group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, the group may be unable
to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business without the ongoing financial support of kerogen
as a substantial shareholder and financier, the successful refinancing of the group's anz financing facility, the achievement
of forecast profits and cash flows and the ability to access sufficient financing and/or dispose of assets, if and when required.


report on the remuneration report

we have audited the remuneration report included on pages 26 to 31 of the directors' report for the year ended 30 june 2012.
the directors of the company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the remuneration report in accordance with
section 300a of the corporations act 2001. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the remuneration report, based on our
audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards.


auditor's opinion
in our opinion, the remuneration report of aj lucas group limited for the year ended 30 june 2012, complies with section 300a
of the corporations act 2001.
