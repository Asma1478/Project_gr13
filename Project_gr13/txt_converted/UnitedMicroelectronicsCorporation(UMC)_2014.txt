                exceeded 90 % for more than two years. the amount of
                hazardous recycled waste is 13,082 metric tons and the
                percentage of hazardous waste recycling is up to 89%.
                the waste-to-resource revenue in taiwan factories in
                2013 is about forty-five million nt dollars.
                in the future, umc will continue to cooperate with waste
                companies and raw material suppliers to develop new
                methods and items for waste recycling.

                water conservation will face increasing challenges in the future as fewer areas will be available to further save water. umc will continue to introduce new technologies
                that can help save water in a cost-effective way. based on 2012 year’s city water consumption, umc has set a goal to save 6% more water in the upcoming 3 years.

                umc understands its business success stems not only
                from employees’ efforts, but also a stable community.
                therefore, since its inception, umc abided by the
                principle that corporations have to contribute to the
                society as a long-term approach to sustainability. umc

                the society, one of the contributions focuses on
                education, because we believe it is an effective way to
                help disadvantaged families out of their current situation.
