chairman’s statement

dear distinguished shareholders’,

it is with great pleasure that i present to you our financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015. a year in which we
made significant progress on the successful implementation of our transformation strategy.

for the second consecutive year, we recorded improved earnings well above the industry average across key indices. we also
recorded exponential growth in our profit before tax (pbt) and profit after tax (pat) performance enablingthe board to fulfil
the commitment made to shareholders at our 2014 annual general meeting and recommend a dividend payment for approval at
this meeting.


global economic environment
the year 2015 recorded declining global output growth, with both advanced and emerging economies suffering deteriorating
economic conditions. the united states of america (usa) and the united kingdom (uk) however stood out as notable economic
growth nodes. both the international monetary fund (imf) and the world bank had to make downward revisions to their growth
forecasts, particularly given the sustained fall in crude oil prices which reached its lowest level in over a decade.


operating environment
the decline in economic growth largely driven by the fall in crude oil prices which began in 2014, continued into 2015 with gross
domestic product (gdp) falling to a low of 2.35% in the fourth quarter of 2015.

the financial markets responded negatively to the central bank of nigeria’s protectionist stance vis a vis the naira, leading to
significant volatility in the equity and debt markets. bearish sentiments dominated activities on the nigerian stock exchange all
share index which declined by 17.37% to close at 28,642.45 for the year. inflationary pressures began to reflect in consumer prices
with analysts predicting that inflation rates will close above 10%.

following his historic electoral victory in the march , 2015 presidential elections, president muhammadu buhari resumed office
demonstrating a strong resolve to address issues of corruption and insecurity in nigeria. the president also began to effect changes
in the leadership of key public institutions, including the national insurance commission (naicom), where alhaji mohammed
kari was appointed as the commissioner for insurance in july 2015. the new commissioner has intensified regulatory supervision,
adopting a zero tolerance approach to compliance infractions. during the year, naicom introduced the prudential guidelines for
insurers and reinsurers in nigeria and the market conduct and business practice guidelines for insurance institutions in nigeria
which took effect in 2015.


financial performance
you will be pleased to learn that despite the inclement operating environment, our market share growth continued to out-pace the
industry average. our gross written premium (gwp) grew by 36% from n5.2billion in 2014 to n7.1billion in 2015. the drivers of
this performance include the following;


growth in market share
customer engagement:

during the year under review, we deepened engagement with our customers, through personal visits and other electronic channels,
using our financial service advisors (fsa) and our contact center.




                                                                                                                                                   15

     customer experience:

     we are investing time to understand our customers’ needs and inventing processes to create a unique and excellent customer
     experience enabling us to reengineer our service delivery processes to ensure an excellent customer experience across all touch
     points.

     consumer research & new products:

     we have completed a detailed consumer research survey which we commissioned to gain deep insight and better understanding
     of consumer needs and opportunities within nigeria and ghana. insights from this consumer research survey are being used to
     develop innovative products for our customers across specific segments. simultaneously, we have enhanced the features, benefits
     and branding of our entire bouquet of compulsory products.

     branding:

     following the launch of our new corporate identity in 2014, we have implemented a number of initiatives to make our brand
     more recognizable and appealing to our target market. we have also taken steps to ensure our brand values are internalized by all
     employees and key partners.


     underwriting performance
     operational efficiency

     we recorded a 12% improvement in our underwriting performance. this was driven largely by our new risk based pricing and
     efficient risk selection criteria. we continue to maintain high solvency margins well above regulatory requirements as well as
     robust reinsurance arrangements

     claims payment

     in 2014, we initiated a comprehensive review of all outstanding claims in our books with a view to ensuring that by december
     2014 they had all been paid. this meant that wapic was well ahead of naicoms 2015 directive for insurance companies to ensure
     payment of all outstanding claims by september 2015. we believe that insurance companies have a moral and fiduciary duty to
     ensure customers claims are processed and paid in the shortest time possible.


     investment performance
     we recorded very strong investment performance in 2015. whilst our investment strategy ensures that our insurance liabilities
     are matched against investments in highly liquid assets, our shareholders’ funds are invested in a slightly more aggressive portfolio
     of assets which include public and non-public equity investments, structured to deliver above market returns. this strategy has
     seen us become the largest shareholder in coronation merchant bank limited an emerging leader in the merchant and investment
     banking subsector which is generating outstanding returns to your company.


     dividend
     subject to your approval at this meeting, the board of directors is recommending a dividend of three (3) kobo per ordinary share.
     i will like to express the appreciation of the board to all our shareholders for your patience given the lack of dividend for over 8
     years, i’m confident that going forward shareholders can look forward to regular dividend payments.


     corporate governance
     in the course of the year, the board accepted the resignation for personal reasons of mr. ashish desai as managing director
     of the company. leveraging on your company’s robust succession planning framework, the board of directors identified and
     recruited mrs. adeyinka adekoya as the new managing director of the company. mrs. adekoya is an accomplished insurance
     professional and brings onboard significant experience, having operated within the insurance industry for over 25years. she has
     strong experience in technical underwriting and broker engagements. her appointment to the board underscores the importance
     that your company attaches to issues of diversity and sustainability.

also during the year, mr. rantimi ogunleye was appointed as the managing director of wapic life assurance limited to replace
mr. olaniyi onifade who took up an appointment with another insurance company. mr. ogunleye has over 20years experience in
the industry where he has worked with some of nigeria’s leading insurance companies. his strong experience in bancassurance,
product design and marketing are of significant relevance to the execution of our corporate strategic plan.

a new managing director was also appointed for wapic insurance (ghana) limited, our ghanaian subsidiary. he is mr. adedayo
arowojolu who was prior to his appointment the group head of the oil & gas group within the institutional client’s sales function
in nigeria. mr. arowojolu is a respected insurance professional with over 15years experience in the insurance industry.

as we welcome in this new team of highly respected professionals to the wapic family, we thank all the outgoing executives for
their contributions to our transformation project during their time with us.


sustainability
our people have worked very hard to ensure the achievement of our corporate objectives and we continue to recruit high quality
personnel with local and international experience to strengthen the capacity of our workforce. during the year we graduated our
second set of 20 graduate trainees from the wapic academy after five (5) months of rigorous classroom training.

we remain conscious of the need to imbibe environmental, social and governance concerns at the heart of our business. as such, i
am pleased to announce the completion of our environmentally friendly head office building which will be commissioned before
the end of this year.

i will like to thank all our employees for their dedication, our customers for their loyalty and patronage, and our shareholders for
your patience and confidence in our board and management.

     chief executive’s statement

     introduction

     the chairman, distinguished shareholders ladies
     and gentlemen. it is my pleasure to be present
     at this occasion and to present a report on the
     activities of wapic insurance plc. however,
     before doing so i will like to give a brief report
     on the economic and regulatory environment in
     which the company operated in the twelve (12)
     months of 2015.

     the year 2015 posed serious challenges for the
     nigerian business environment as it witnessed
     the conduct of a general election that heralded
     the transition of political power from the ruling
     party to the opposition. the heightened tension
     and obvious retraction of business within the
     first quarter of the year posed serious concerns.
     however there was a little reprieve as the change
     of power went on smoothly without violence or
     business disruption.

     this period was followed by uncertainty within
     the economy, the fall in the price of crude oil at
     the international market and it’s impact on the
     revenue earnings of the federal government and
     it’s abilities to meet the import requirements in
     terms of foreign exchange posed serious concerns.

     in spite of these challenges your company’s gross written premium (gwp) growth of 37% was well above the industry
     average of 12%. the company also showed its sustained strength with the am best rating of b- on financial strength (fsr)
     and bb- on issuer credit rating strength with a stable outlook. this makes wapic the 3rd nigerian insurer to achieve an
     international rating.

     regulatory environment

     the regulatory environment has been very supportive . since the enforcement of the no premium no cover policy by national
     insurance commission naicom, operators in the industry have experienced improved cash flow as customers begin to align
     their business decisions with the policy guidelines.

     the regulator has established minimum operating standards in the conduct of insurance business in nigeria with the release of
     the revised operational and business conduct guidelines in july 2015. this is intended to harmonize and bring greater sanity into
     the insurance business operations in the country.

     in line with the vision to prepare the nigerian insurance industry for the leadership positon in the emerging market, the
     regulators are in the process of reviewing the insurance act in order to align the insurance industry with the expectations
     of the global economies.

competition and market development

the operating environment remains competitively stiff, hence the need to invest in consumer research to have a better
understanding of our market and grow our market share ahead of competition. this is in line with the strategic thrust of
the company and the fast changing business landscape and paradigm.

group activities

the group’s overall business operations which consists of non life, life and investments recorded remarkable growth
during the period under review as briefly detailed below.

non-life business

in 2015, the non-life business portfolio achieved significant growth of 30% in gross written premium (gwp), driven
largely by oil & energy, motor and marine business. oil & energy remained the strongest class of business and contributed
41% in 2015 as against 31% in 2014, while motor and marine contributed 15% and 6% respectively.

the company recorded a growth of 30% in 2015 in net premium income (npi). oil & energy alone contributed 35%, while
motor and general accident contributed 23% and 30% respectively. non-life claims grew by 154%, mainly as a result of
the large scale natural catastrophe in our ghana operations on the 3rd june 2015. the growth in claims resulted in a 4%
decline in underwriting results for 2015 as against 2014.

life business

there was an 87% growth in the gross written premium (gwp) for life business from n651million recorded in 2014 to
n1.22billion in 2015. the result was in line with the strategic thrust of increasing the company’s share of life business in
the market. the growth in gwp was driven by the group life product which grew by 119%. net premium income also grew
in the same manner with group life contributing 93%, while net claims grew by 18%. the growth was driven by claims in
the group life class of business and is in direct relation to the growth in business..

investments

our strategic decision to diversify into chosen markets have started to produce the desired results. the company invested
in both public and non-public equities during the period. notable amongst our non-public equity investments is our
investment in coronation merchant bank (cmb) which is now an associate of the company.

performance ratios

inspite of the numerous challenges in the operating environment during the year under review, the company recorded
significant growth in its business operations.

gross written premium (gwp) ra 37% growth was recorded in 2015 against the corresponding period in 2014 while net
premium income ( npi) similarly grew by 32% from n2.84billion in 2014 to n3.9billion in 2015




                                                                                                                                      19

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




     profit after taxation grew by 448% to n1.3billion as against n237million in 2014. the earnings per share of 10k .in 2015
     was an improvement on the 2k in 2014 while the shareholders funds was n14.96billion as against n14.2billion in 2014.

     in 2014, while insurance contract liabilities grew by 52% from n3billon in 2014 to n4.6billion in 2015, our risk retention
     also improved from 61% in 2014 to 63% in 2015. finally. net assets per share grew to 112k in 2015 from 106k in 2014 while
     return on equity was 10% from 2% in 2014.

     future outlook
     the outlook for our industry remains bright especially in the wake of the emerging opportunities in the oil & gas, aviation,
     small and medium scale enterprises, retail as well as the now postively evolving civil service workforce under the present
     federal government. we would continue to strategically occupy and perform leading roles in the provision of appropriate
     products and delivery channels for the various segments and sectors of the market.

     distinguished ladies and gentlemen, the above cannot be achieved without deliberate investment in our human capital.
     in this regard, investment in our human assets will continue to occupy a greater proportion of our strategic thrust through
     innovative products, specific training programe and information technology, to achieve cutting edge service delivery.

     we are convinced that with commitment to our goals and objectives, management will continually achieve significant
     growth, in profitability and shareholder value. your continued support is therefore required as we move ahead in our
     chosen markets.

     i thank you all and god bless

technical, operations and product report


technical operations
in spite of the economical challenges experienced in the year, the company continued in its quest to ensure a pleasurable
customer experience for its customers by offering innovative and tailor made products to meet our customers needs. we
re-branded our motor product (moov) and created three variants as part of our aim to please our customers. we also re-
packaged our compulsory occupiers and group life products.

similarly, superior service delivery and creation of channels through which our customers’ reach could be expanded was
given priority in the year 2015. we also initiated the implementation of a robust technology infrastructure to support our
operations and actualize the corporate objectives of the company.

we equally improved our business portfolio through our new risk based pricing and adopted efficient risk selection criteria
by using enhanced data analysis to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns. we leveraged on the support of our in-house
actuary and two external consulting firms to enrich and ensure proper simulation of our prices and maintenance of adequate
reserves. this ensured that the company complied consistently with solvency margin requirement for the business..

underwriting
2015 saw a continuation of our strategic growth. the general business portfolio experienced a 30% growth in gross written
premium (gwp), driven largely by growth in the oil & energy, motor and marine insurance premium incomes. the oil &
energy business remained the strongest class of business and contributed 41% to gwp as against 31% in 2014. motor and
fire & special perils insurance business segments contributed 15% and 6% to gwp respectively in 2015.

net premium income recorded a growth of 45% in 2015. this was largely driven by oil & energy, motor and general
accident which grew by 35%, 23% and 30% respectively in the year under review.

furthermore, the company experienced a 42% growth in underwriting results this year (underwriting results being
underwriting income less expenses).

the motor, oil & energy and general accident classes of business contributed 19% 37%, and 33% respectively to the
general business underwriting results for the year under review.

the life business gwp grew by 87% in 2015. this indicated a full recovery from the slower growth of 2% experienced in
2014 due to the implementation of the no premium, no cover policy and the deepening of our strategic initiatives.

the growth in the life gwp was driven largely by group life product which grew by 119%..

claims
we recognize that claims payment reinforces customer’s confidence and so we continued to ensure that our customers were
delighted by their claims experience through our prompt claims settlement process.




                                                                                                                                     31

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




      the total claims paid in 2015 are as distributed below across the various portfolios;

       1. group life scheme – 27%
       2. general accident portfolio – 17%
       3. oil & gas schemes - 7%
       4. motor - 20%
       5. engineering - 1%
       6. marine business - 6% and

       7. aviation business - 3%


     reinsurance
     the company established and maintained robust reinsurance arrangements with highly rated reinsurance companies that
     we partnered with. we continued to ensure efficiency in matching premium generated against reinsurance expenses.

     during the financial year, the company had business transactions with the following re-insurance companies in compliance
     with the insurance act of 2003.




      foreign reinsurers:                                                     rating                        agency

     performance ratios
     we closed the year with an underwriting expense ratio of 17%, a claims ratio of 30% and an operating expense ratio of
     49%. underwriting expense remained flat when compared to prior year, the increase on claims ratio from 35% in 2014 was
     mainly as a result of huge claims payout from our ghana subsidiary, operating expense ratio improved from 59% in 2014.

     this resulted in a combined ratio of 89% representing a drop from the 97% recorded in 2014. the insurance liabilities of
     the company increased by 52% from n3.07billion in 2014 to n4.68billion in 2015, a reflection of the growing buffer for
     our policy holders. retention ratio improved from 61% in 2014 to 63% in 2015. overall, we have continued to improve our
     underwriting capacity and are very confident that we would enjoy better returns from the underwriting arm of our business
     in the near future.

     despite the numerous challenges we face in our daily operations from the sub-optimal business terrain, we would stay
     focused on the opportunities for business success and charge ourselves with delivering customer experience and illuminating
     the insurance industry with bespoke customer focused services for the benefit of our customers and other stakeholders. we
     shall continue to enhance our relationship with brokers, agents and all other stakeholders who played significant roles in

this investment is n1.12billion.

total aum declinded to n17.29billion during the period under review. this represented a 4.05% drop against the preceeding

     our culture – the wapic way
     wapic aims to create a dynamic working environment through a strong performance-driven culture, by collaborating,

     on people growth and development, in order to nurture a committed and engaged workforce.

     we believe in driving a culture that gives our people the room to achieve, to grow and to seek new opportunities. we
     also seek to be the most innovative, the most tenacious in opening new markets and the most creative in developing new
     products and offering state-of-the-art services to clients, brokers and agents around the world.

     the wapic culture is largely one of leadership. our actions will inspire others to follow. our organization will be worthy of
     emulation in all that we do and the wapic brand will embody this culture. our culture will be reflected in our vision and
     mission which is derived from our shared goals and strategies.

     our culture will be reflected in our story, brand, and values and most importantly in our people. these are the elements that

     sustainability report


     wapic has imbibed a culture of sustainable business practices. we recognize that the success of our business is dependent
     upon transparency, strong corporate governance and stakeholder management.

     in order to further enshrine these practices, we have developed a robust sustainability strategy that defines and addresses
     the challenges of balancing economic growth, social development and environmental protection so that future generations
     are not compromised by actions taken today. this will ensure that we operate in a responsible and ethnical manner, treating
     our stakeholders with respect.

     our intention is to ultimately provide superior products and services for our clients while simultaneously working to
     improve the environmental social and economic aspects of the communities in which we operate.


     employee standards, diversity and human rights
     wapic’s workplace policies and practices aim at shaping corporate culture and guiding relationships amongst employees
     and the company. we are committed to creating a work environment where people can make a difference both as
     individuals and as part of a team. the engaging, inclusive work environment of wapic helps attract, engage and retain
     talented employees while enabling them to achieve their full potentials.

     the company is committed to respecting human rights in all its business activities through compliance with national
     laws and in labour legislation. our workplace policies and practices are aimed at shaping corporate culture and guiding
     relationships between the company and its stakeholder groups


     customer satisfaction
     wapic recognizes that marketplace perceptions and reactions to business behaviour and practices are critical to corporate
     success. as part of our social responsibility, we strive to reinforce confidence in the insurance market particularly in the
     area of prompt claims payment.

     we are committed to treating our customers fairly, with openness and transparency, and ensure that our marketing
     practices enable us to focus on building and maintaining sustainable, long-term relationships with our customers. using
     our various channels platforms, we endeavor to make our customers feel special by reaching out to them individually.

     occupational health and safety
     wapic protects the health and safety of its employees, customers, vendors and the public by implementing policies and
     initiatives that demonstrate our commitment to a safe, secure, and healthy work environment. we trained certified
     personnel as fire wardens, fire searchers and continuously conduct fire drill exercises. in the period under review, we
     experienced no workplace accidents, fatalities or occupational and safety incidents.

     investing in the community
     we believe in adding value to the communities in which we operate by investing in economic, social and cultural
     development. the company’s social investment focuses on assisting progress in education, health, the environment,
     enterprise development and social welfare. in the period under review, we provided various types of support in the
     form of giving cash, or giving employee time or simply giving gifts, all of which are practices that align with acceptable
     global standards. we collaborated with credible and impactful organizations to build strong and healthy communities
     where people can live and work, and where businesses can survive into the future. for instance, wapic co-sponsored the
     production of a film on ebola- 93 days which is media based initiative centered on the true-life story of men and women
     who risked their lives and made sacrifices to save the nigerian people from the consequences of the outbreak of the highly-
     dreaded ebola virus disease. the film has not be released yet.

ethical supplier relations
our operating standards for purchasing services and products, and for selection of suppliers, have contributed to building
a sustainable business. wapic recognizes that its dealings with suppliers often take place in cultures with different norms
and values. we therefore expect our suppliers to have a natural respect for ethical standards in the context of their own
particular culture. the company’s procurement activities give due consideration to social impacts and human rights,
environmental impacts and the need to combat bribery and corruption. our relationship with suppliers is based on the
principle of fair and honest dealings at all times and in all ways. we therefore pay attention to treating suppliers fairly,
selecting vendors based on value, performance and price, providing justifiable and transparent selection.


workplace policy and programme
we recognise that hiv/aids, tb and malaria together pose a serious threat to our operations and productivity. the
company seeks to minimise the social and economic consequences of these diseases to our employees, their families and
the broader community. wapic therefore implements an hiv/aids, tb and malaria workplace policy which encompasses
prevention, care and support, while promoting a working environment that is free of stigmatization and discrimination.
we also create awareness on other health issues that can affect the workplace as they emerge such as the zika virus, ebola,
lassa fever e.t.c


stakeholder engagements
our stakeholders include rating agencies, governments, parastatals, not-for-profit organisations, employees, local
communities, regulators, analysts, shareholders, investors, customers, suppliers, media, development finance institutions
(dfis) and multilateral agencies. we categorise stakeholders based on their interaction with our business activities. the
categories are not mutually exclusive; some groups potentially have interests that cut across a number of areas. we commit
adequate resources to ensuring that we understand the views and needs of all our stakeholders, and also that we are able
to respond positively and in a timely manner to their feedback. we adopt a number of mechanisms to engage stakeholders,
including opinion surveys, focus group discussions on particular issues, regular dialogue with media representatives and
ngos and staff, consultations with consumer groups and involvement in industry-wide discussions.


ethics and whistle-blowing
wapic deployed a more robust whistle-blower system in 2015 to enable staff to report unethical activities affecting the
company so that measures can be taken to address them. the system was outsourced to the kpmg ethics line. this
has enhanced awareness of the existence of a whistle-blowing channel and increased the confidence of staff and other
stakeholders with regards to reporting any suspicious activities or misconduct that could damage the company’s operations
or reputation. it has deterred workplace misdemeanours and strengthened staff integrity and discipline. about 90% of staff
across the company and its subsidiaries have received training in ethics and wapic’s whistle-blower system.

as an ethical organization, wapic has demonstrated zero tolerance for bribery and corruption. this is clearly defined in the
company’s anti-bribery and corruption policy as well as our code of conduct for directors and staff.


                                                                                                                                                                          39

     risk management

     introduction and overview
     wapic insurance plc recognizes the role of enterprise risk management practices in achieving her strategic vision of being
     a leading insurance company in nigeria. the group has a well-established risk governance structure and an experienced
     risk team. our risk management framework provides essential tools to enable us take timely and informed decisions to
     maximize opportunities and mitigate potential threats.

     our approach to risk management
     risk is an inherent part of wapic insurance plc (“the company”) and its subsidiary companies’ (“the group”) business
     activities. wapic’s overall risk tolerance is established in the context of the group’s earning power, capital, and diversified
     business model. effective risk management is critical to any insurance company for achieving financial soundness. based
     on the foregoing, aligning risk management to the company’s organizational structure and business strategy has become
     an integral part of our business. wapic insurance plc’s risk management framework and governance structure are intended
     to provide comprehensive controls and management of the major risks inherent in its business activities. it is also intended
     to create a culture of risk awareness and personal responsibility group wide.

     in addition to the monitoring of the risk types, the risk correlation between risk types is also being monitored. to ensure
     that the inter-relationships between risk types are kept within moderate level, where appropriate, underwriting and
     investment standards have been tightened. to mitigate against higher level of market volatility and economic uncertainty,
     the group regularly subjects its exposures to a range of stress tests across a wide variety of products, currencies, portfolios,
     profitability, and customer segments.

     the group’s risk management architecture is carefully crafted to balance corporate oversight with well-defined risk
     management functions, which fall within any of the three categories where risk must be managed: lines of business,
     governance and control and corporate audit. the board of directors and management of the company are committed
     to constantly establishing, implementing and sustaining tested practices in risk management to match those of leading
     international insurance companies. we are convinced that the long-term sustainability of our group depends critically on
     the proper governance and effective management of our business. as such, risk management occupies a significant position
     of relevance and importance in the group.

     the board of directors determines wapic insurance plc’s overall risk objectives by issuing risk policies. these policies
     define acceptable levels of risk for day-to-day operations as well as the willingness of wapic to assume risk, weighed against
     the expected rewards. the umbrella risk policy is detailed in the enterprise risk management (erm) framework, which is
     a structured approach to identifying opportunities, assessing the risk inherent in these opportunities and actively managing
     these risks in a cost-effective manner. it is a top-level integrated approach to events identification and analysis for proper
     assessment, monitoring and identification of business opportunities. specific risk policies are also in place for managing
     risks in the different core risk areas of underwriting, claims, credit, market and operational risks as well as for other key
     risks such as liquidity, strategic and reputational risk.

     the evolving nature of risk management practices and the dynamic nature of the insurance industry require regular review
     of the effectiveness of each enterprise risk management component. in the light of the above, the group’s erm framework
     is subject to continuous review to ensure effective and cutting-edge risk management. the review is done in either or both
     of the following ways: via continuous self-evaluation and monitoring by the risk management and compliance functions
     in conjunction with internal audit; and through independent evaluation by external auditors, examiners and consultants.
     the group’s management has primary responsibility for risk management and the review of the erm framework and to
     provide robust challenge based on quantitative and qualitative metrics. all amendments to the group’s erm framework
     require board approval. the risk management division is responsible for the enforcement of the group’s risk policy by
     constantly monitoring risk, with the aim of identifying and quantifying significant risk exposures and acting upon such
     exposures as necessary.

     overall, we view risk not only as a threat or uncertainty, but also as a potential opportunity to grow and develop the
     business, within the context of our clearly articulated and board driven risk appetite.

hence our approach to risk management is not limited to considering downside impacts or risk avoidance; it also
encompasses taking risk knowingly for competitive advantage. wapic insurance plc approaches risk, capital and value
management robustly and we believe that our initiatives to date have positioned the group at the leading edge of risk
management.



risk management philosophy, culture, appetite and objectives


risk management philosophy and culture
risk management is at the core of the operating structure of the group. we ensure that we limit adverse variations in
earnings and capital by managing risk exposures within our moderate risk appetite. our risk management approach
includes minimizing undue concentrations of exposure, limiting potential losses from stress events and the prudent
management of liquidity.

in 2015, our risk management practice continued to achieve desired results despite the increase in size and scale of
operations. hence, management has remained closely involved with risk management initiatives, which have focused on
preserving appropriate levels of capital and liquidity, as well as managing the risk inherent in the portfolios.

risk management is integral to the group’s decision-making and management process. it is embedded in the role of all
employees to ensure congruence with organizational culture, thus enhancing the quality of decision making across board.
the group considers risk management philosophy and culture as the set of shared beliefs, values, attitudes and practices
that characterize how the group considers risk in everything it does, from strategy development and implementation to its
day-to-day activities. in this regard, the group’s risk management philosophy is that a moderate and guarded risk attitude
ensures sustainable growth in shareholder value and reputation.

the group believes that enterprise risk management provides the superior capabilities to identify and assess the full
spectrum of risks and to enable staff at all levels better understand and manage risks. this will ensure that:

  •   risk acceptance is done in a responsible manner;
  •   the executive and the board of the company have adequate risk management support;
  •   uncertain outcomes are better anticipated;
  •   accountability is strengthened; and
  •   stewardship is enhanced.

the group identifies the following attributes as guiding principles for its risk culture;

  a) management and culture:

      • consider all forms of risk in decision-making;
      • create and evaluate business-unit and group-wide risk profile to consider what is best for their individual business
        units/department;
      • adopt a portfolio view of risk in addition to understanding individual risk elements;
      • retain ownership and accountability for risk and risk management at the business unit or other point of influence
        level;
      • strive to achieve best practices in enterprise risk management;
      • document and report all significant risks and enterprise-risk management deficiencies;
      • adopt a holistic and integrated approach to risk management and bring all risks together under one or a limited
        number of oversight;
      • empower risk officers to perform their duties professionally and independently without undue interference;
      • ensure clear segregation of duties between market facing business units and risk management/control functions;
      • continue to demonstrate appropriate standards of behavior in development of strategy and pursuit of objectives.

       b) risk officers’ work as allies and thought partners to other stakeholders within and outside the group and are guided
          in the exercise of their powers by a deep sense of responsibility, professionalism and respect for other parties.
       c) risk management is a shared responsibility. therefore, the company aims to build a shared perspective on risks that
          is based on consensus.
       d) risk management is governed by well-defined policies, which are clearly communicated across the group.
       e) equal attention is paid to both quantifiable and non-quantifiable risks.
       f) the group avoids products and businesses it does not understand.

risk management unit – relationship with other units
the relationships between risk management unit (rmu) and other units are highlighted below:

  •   rmu sets policies and defines risk limits for other units in the company;
  •   rmu performs group-wide risk monitoring and reporting;
  •   other units provide relevant data to rmd for risk monitoring and reporting and identify potential risks in their line of
      business and rmu provides a framework for managing such risks;
  •   rmu and market facing units collaborate in designing new products;
  •   rmu and internal audit co-ordinate activities to provide a holistic view of risks across the group;
  •   rmu makes recommendations with respect to capital allocation, pricing and reward/sanctions based on risk reports; and
  •   information technology support group provides relevant user support to the rmd function in respect of the various risk
      management software.


group risk oversight approach
our oversight starts with the strategy setting and business planning process. these plans help us articulate our appetite for
risk, which is then set as risk appetite limits for each business unit to work within.

the group’s risk management division provides a central oversight of risk management across the group to ensure that the
full spectrum of risks facing the group are properly identified, measured, monitored and controlled in order to minimize
adverse outcomes.

the division is complemented by the financial control, strategy /pmo and compliance group in the management of capital
management, strategic and compliance risks, respectively.

the chief risk officer coordinates the process of monitoring and reporting risks across the group. internal audit has the
responsibility of auditing the risk management and control function to ensure that all units charged with risk management
perform their roles effectively on a continuous basis. audit also tests the adequacy of internal control and makes appropriate
recommendations where there are weaknesses.


strategy and business planning
risk management is embedded in our business strategy and planning cycle. testament to this is the inclusion of risk
management as one of our strategic priorities. by setting the business and risk strategy, we are able to determine appropriate
capital allocation and target setting for the group and each of our businesses.

all business units are required to consider the risk implications of their annual plans. these plans include analysis of the
impact of objectives on risk exposure. throughout the year, we monitored business performance regularly focusing both
on financial performance and risk exposure. the aim is to continue the process of integrating risk management into the
planning and management process and to facilitate informed decisions.

through ongoing review, the links between risk appetite, risk management and strategic planning are embedded in the
business so that key decisions are made in the context of the risk appetite for each business unit.


risk appetite
risk appetite is an articulation and allocation of the risk capacity or quantum of risk the company is willing to accept in
pursuit of its strategy, duly set and monitored by the executive committee and the board, and integrated into our strategy,
business, risk and capital plans. risk appetite reflects the group’s capacity to sustain potential losses arising from a range
of potential outcomes under different stress scenarios.

the group defines its risk appetite in terms of both volatility of earnings and the maintenance of minimum regulatory
capital requirements under stress scenarios.




                                                                                                                                       43

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




     our risk appetite can be expressed in terms of how much variability of return the group is prepared to accept in order to
     achieve a desired level of result. it is determined by considering the relationship between risk and return. we measure
     and express risk appetite qualitatively and in terms of quantitative risk metrics. the quantitative metrics include earnings
     at risk (or earnings volatility) and, related to this, the chance of regulatory insolvency, chance of experiencing a loss and
     economic capital adequacy. these comprise our group- level risk appetite metrics. in addition, a large variety of risk limits,
     triggers, ratios, mandates, targets and guidelines are in place for all the financial risks (e.g. credit, market and asset and
     liability management risks).

     the group’s risk profile is assessed through a ‘bottom-up’ analytical approach covering all of the group’s major businesses,
     subsidiaries and products. the risk appetite is approved by the board and forms the basis for establishing the risk
     parameters within which the businesses must operate, including policies, concentration limits and business mix.

     in 2015, the risk appetite metrics were tracked against approved triggers and exceptions were reported to management for
     prompt corrective actions. key issues were also escalated to the board risk management committee.


     risk objectives
     the broad risk management objectives of the group are:

     to identify and manage existing and new risks in a planned and coordinated manner with minimum disruption and cost;

       •   to protect against unforeseen losses and ensure stability of earnings;
       •   to maximize earnings potential and opportunities;
       •   to maximize share price and stakeholder protection;
       •   to enhance credit ratings and depositor, analyst, investor and regulator perception; and
       •   to develop a risk culture that encourages all staff to identify risks and associated opportunities and to respond to
           them with cost effective actions.


     risk categorization
     wapic insurance plc is exposed to an array of risks through its operations. the group has identified and categorized its
     exposure to these broad risks as listed below:

       •   credit risk
       •   operational risk
       •   market risk
       •   liquidity risk
       •   underwriting risk
       •   property price risk
       •   reputational risk


     credit risk:
     credit risk is the risk of default arising from the uncertainty of a counterparty’s ability to perform its contractual obligations.
     this may arise from the following but not limited to premium receivables, reinsurance recoveries, fund placements in deposit
     money banks, vendors, and fund’s managers. however, in terms of premium payment and investments in counterparties,
     considerable risks exist that brokers and lead insurers who are allowed extended payment period may default.


     operational risk:
     this is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.
     this includes legal risk, strategic risk and reputational risk. legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to fines,
     penalties, or punitive damages resulting from supervisory actions, as well as private settlements.

                                                                                                                       annual report & accounts




market risk:
market risk is the risk that the value of an investment will decrease due to movements in market factors. volatility frequently
refers to the standard deviation of the change in value of a financial instrument with a specific time horizon. the group is
exposed to this risk through its financial assets and comprises of:

  •   interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a fixed income security will fall as a result of movement in market interest rates.
  •   equity price risk: the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as a result of changes in the levels of equity indices and
      the value of individual stocks.
  •   foreign exchange risk: the risk associated with movement in the exchange prices on dollar-based transactions which the
      company is exposed to.
  •   property price risk: the risk arising from changes in the market value of properties and fluctuations in expected rental
      incomes.


liquidity risk:
this is the risk that a company may be unable to meet short term financial demands. this usually occurs due to the inability
to convert a security or hard asset to cash without a loss of capital and/or income in the process. wapic insurance plc
recognizes the risk of loss due to insufficient liquid assets to meet cash flow requirements or to fulfill its financial obligation
once a claim crystallize.


underwriting risk:
underwriting activities are primarily concerned with the pricing, acceptance and management of risks arising from our contracts
with policyholders. it entails the risk that:

  •   the prices charged by the group for insurance contracts will be ultimately inadequate to support the future obligations
      arising from those contracts, risk exposure under its insurance contracts that were unanticipated in the design and
      pricing of the insurance contract;
  •   risks are not adequately ceded to reinsurers exposing the group to potential high claims pay-out;
  •   many more claims occur than expected or that some claims that occur are much larger than expected claims resulting
      in unexpected losses and;
  •   the group’s policyholder will act in ways that are unanticipated and have an adverse effect on the group.


reputational risk:
the group is exposed to this risk through events that damage its image amongst stakeholders and the public which may impair
the ability to retain, generate and drive sustainable business. we understand that reputational risk is the biggest risk to our
business as it poses a special threat to the confidence of our customers, regulators and industry.


operational risk management
operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems, or from external
events. our definition of operational risk excludes regulatory risks, strategic risks and potential losses related solely to judgments
with regard to taking credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, or insurance risks.

it also includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market conduct in which the company
is involved. operational risk is inherent in wapic’s global business activities and, as with other risk types, is managed through
an overall framework designed to balance strong corporate oversight with well-defined independent risk management. this
framework includes:

  •   recognized ownership of the risk by the businesses;
  •   oversight by independent risk management; and
  •   independent review by corporate audit.



                                                                                                                                                  45

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




     we seek to minimize exposure to operational risk, subject to cost trade-offs. operational risk exposures are managed through a
     consistent set of management processes that drive risk identification, assessment, control and monitoring.

     the goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of our businesses, the markets in which we
     operate, our capital and liquidity, and the competitive, economic and regulatory environment. notwithstanding these controls,
     wapic group incurs operational losses.

     our operational risk strategy seeks to minimize the impact that operational risk can have on shareholders’ value.


     the company’s strategy is to:

       •   reduce the likelihood of occurrence of expected events and related cost by managing the risk factors and implementing
           loss prevention or reduction techniques to reduce variation to earnings.
       •   minimize the impact of unexpected and catastrophic events and related costs through risk financing strategies that
           will support the company’s long term growth, cash flow management and balance sheet protection.
       •   eliminate bureaucracy, improve productivity, reduce capital requirements and improve overall performance through
           the institution of well designed and implemented internal controls.

     in order to create and promote a culture that emphasizes effective operational risk management and adherence to operating
     controls, there are three distinct levels of operational risk governance structure in wapic insurance plc.

       level 1
       refers to the oversight function carried out by the board of directors, board risk committee and the executive management.
       responsibilities at this level include ensuring effective management of operational risk and adherence to the approved
       operational risk policies.

       level 2
       refers to the management function carried out by operational risk management group. it has direct responsibility for
       formulating and implementing the group’s operational risk management framework including methodologies, policies
       and procedures approved by the board.

       level 3
       refers to the operational function carried out by all business units and support functions in the group. these
       units/functions are fully responsible and accountable for the management of operational risk in their respective units.
       they work in liaison with operational risk management to define and review controls to mitigate identified risks. internal
       audit provides independent assessment and evaluation of the group’s operational risk management framework. this
       periodic confirmation of the existence and utilization of controls in compliance with approved policies and procedures,
       provide assurance as to the effectiveness of the group’s operational risk management framework. importantly, the
       tools used to assess, measure and monitor operational risks in the group include but not limited to a loss database of
       operational risk events; an effective risk and control self-assessment process that helps to analyze business activities and
       identify operational risks that could affect the achievement of business objectives; and key risk indicators which are used
       to monitor operational risks on an ongoing basis.


     the group’s operational risk framework
     the group’s current operational risk framework was implemented to meet internal and regulatory requirements. there has been
     significant investment in the implementation of improved measurement and management approaches for operational risk to
     strengthen control, improve customer service, improve process efficiencies and minimize operating losses. the group recognizes
     the fact that it is neither cost-effective nor possible to attempt to eliminate all operational risks.


     events of small significance are thus expected to occur and are accepted as inevitable with relevant budgeting for these losses
     being exercised where appropriate. events of material significance are limited and the group seeks to reduce the risk from these
     extreme events in a framework consistent with its agreed risk appetite. processes are in place to monitor management and future

mitigation of such events. the role of risk department is to establish, implement and maintain the operational risk framework
for the modelling and managing of the group’s operational risk, while reinforcing and enabling operational risk management
culture throughout the group. the aim is to integrate, based on international norms and best practices, all operational risk
activities and to compile a reliable operational risk profile contributing to the group’s risk- reward profile. the key advantage
introduced by the current framework is the financial quantification and modelling of operational risks. this functionality has
significantly improved the group’s operational risk measurement and management capabilities.


management and control responsibilities
the first line of governance for managing operational risk rests with business and operational risk management that forms
part of the day-to-day responsibilities of all business unit management. business unit staff report any identified breakdowns in
control and any risk events that may result in financial loss and/or reputation damage. amongst others, business management
are responsible to ensure that processes for identifying and addressing ineffective controls and the mitigating of risk events are
implemented and executed.


operational risk teams form the secondary line of governance by ensuring that processes to identify weaknesses are effective
and identified weaknesses are acted upon. the group operational risk profile is presented to the board quarterly. control
effectiveness is monitored at the risk management committee and at the board; and the multi-layered system of defenses
ensures pro-active operational risk management.


measuring and managing operational risk
the group recognizes the significance of operational risk and is committed to enhancing the measurement and management
thereof. within the group’s operational risk framework, qualitative and quantitative methodologies and tools are applied group-
wide to identify and assess operational risks and to provide management information for determining appropriate mitigating
measures.


risk event data collection and reporting
a standard process is used group-wide for the recognition, capture, assessment, analysis and reporting of risk events. this
process is used to help identify where process and control requirements are needed to reduce the recurrence of risk events. risk
events are loaded onto a central database and reported monthly to the ermc.


risk and control self-assessments (rcsa)
in order to pro-actively identify and actively mitigate risks, the operational risk framework utilizes rcsas. rcsa is used at a
granular level to identify relevant material risks and key controls mitigating these risks. the risks and controls are assessed on
a quarterly basis and relevant action plans are put in place to treat, tolerate, terminate or transfer the risks, taking into account
the relevant business risk appetites. the rcsa programme is extensive and covers the entire group. the internal audit further
tests the effectiveness of the rcsas within the normal course of auditing and relevant metrics are monitored and actioned where
relevant.


key risk indicators (kris)
a comprehensive set of kris are in place across the group, with relevant and agreed thresholds set by the business. kris are
monitored on a group as well as business unit level, based on significance. threshold breaches are managed in accordance with
an agreed process across the group.


reporting
business units are required to report on both a regular and an event-driven basis. the reports include a profile of the key risks to
their business objectives, rcsa and kri results, and operational risk events. risk reports are presented to executive management
and risk committees.


                                                                                                                                             47

     information security and continuity of business
     information security and the protection of confidential and sensitive customer data are priority of the company. the group
     has developed and implemented an information security risk management framework that is in line with best practice.
     the framework is reviewed and enhanced regularly to address emerging threats to customers’ information.

     a critical tool in managing our operational risk is the business continuity plan (bcp) that documents the procedures to be
     executed by relevant teams in the event of a disaster. the group assesses the feasibility of its bcp annually by simulating
     a disaster and gaps noted are properly addressed to ensure that business operations are not disrupted in the event of a
     disaster.

     credit risk management
     credit risk arises from the failure of a counterparty of the company to repay amount due as at an agreed date or failure to
     perform as agreed. wapic’s exposure to credit risk is primarily derived from the following activities:

       •    unpaid premium from insured or brokers; and
       •    non-recovery of claims paid from reinsurers.

     the group’s risk management philosophy is that moderate and guarded risk attitude will ensure sustainable growth in
     shareholder’s value and reputation. wapic’s policy is to set out specific rules for risk origination and management of the
     investment portfolio. the plan also sets out the roles and responsibilities of different individuals and committees charged
     with these responsibilities.

     wapic insurance group is exposed to risk relating to its debt holdings in its investment portfolio, outstanding premiums
     from brokers, co-insurance and the reliance on reinsurers to make payment when certain loss conditions are met.

     following naicom’s introduction of a new prudential guideline which took effect on july 2015, the group’s investment
     policy was adjusted to accommodate the new limits set to guide insurers asset allocation for both policyholders’ funds and
     shareholders’ funds. this led to the adjustments of the group’s limits on fixed income and money market instruments
     including portfolio composition limits, issuer type limits, aggregate issuer limits and corporate sector limits.

     the group’s investment portfolio and receivables are exposed to credit risk through its fixed income money market
     instruments, trade receivables and reinsurance receivables. the total exposures from the group’s and company’s financial
     assets to credit risk are as follows:

the group’s exposure to credit risk is low as government sector (government bonds and treasury bills) and money market
accounted for 83% of the investment as at 31 december 2015 (93% in 31 december 2014).

the group further manages its exposure to credit risk through counterparty risk via established limits as approved by the
board. these limits are determined based on credit ratings of the counterparty amongst other factors. all fixed income
investments are measured for performance on a quarterly basis and monitored by management on a monthly basis.

reinsurance contract is executed only with reinsurers with a minimum acceptable credit rating. the creditworthiness of all
reinsurers is monitored and reported to management by the risk management function by reviewing their annual financial
statements and qualitative observations through formal and informal communication channels. reinsurance treaties are
reviewed annually by management prior to renewal of the reinsurance contract.

aside credit risk exposure from our investment policies, the group is also exposed to this risk from its core business –
outstanding premiums from clients.

     trade receivables are short-term in nature consisting of a large number of policyholders and are subject to moderate credit
     risk. the group categorizes its exposure to this risk based on business sources (namely agents, brokers and insurance
     companies) and periodically reviews trade receivable to ensure credit worthiness.

     credit risk exposure to trade receivables arises from the 30 days window given by naicom in the “no premium no cover”
     (npnc) policy. this gives brokers the latitude to withhold premiums collected from insured for 30 day. however, they
     are expected to issue their credit note and remit the premiums at the expiration of the 30 days grace period. brokers who
     fails to remit are reported on quarterly basis to naicom and are subject to the downgrading process in the group’s credit
     policy guide. the group’s risk exposure to credit risk is low as the receipt of insurance premium from the insured is a pre-
     condition for the issuance of insurance cover.


     market risk management
     the financial markets of nigeria and ghana were adversely affected by volatility in the markets. wapic insurance plc’s
     ability to meet business objectives was affected by the adverse changes in the major market risk factors: interest rates,
     foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and property prices. wapic’s identification, management, control, measurement and
     reporting of market risk is designed along the following major risk factors;

       1. interest rate risk
       2. foreign exchange risk

       3. equity price risk


     1. interest rate risk
     interest rate risk is the exposure of the group’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates, yield curves and
     credit spreads. the group is exposed to interest rate risk through the interest bearing assets and liabilities in the company’s
     books. the company is significantly exposed to interest-rate risk as the percentage of interest yielding assets to aum is
     significant. also, the group is exposed to interest rate risk through its life underwriting investment policies that have
     guaranteed interest rate. as a result, the company’s investment income move in the direction of interest rate in the short
     and medium term. the drop in the central bank of nigeria (cbn) monetary policy rate (mpr) in november 2015 from 13
     percent to 11 percent and the contractionary direction of monetary policy saw a sharp drop in interest with treasury bills
     getting as low as 1 percent. this development presents a big challenge for 2016 investment income. the investment team
     have reviewed the current asset allocation to ensure an optimal yield given the falling interest rates and the slowdown in
     the economy.

foreign exchange risk
foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in
foreign exchange rates.

foreign exchange risk exposure of the group’s financial condition is due to adverse movements in exchange rates. the
group is exposed to foreign exchange currency risk primarily through transactions denominated in foreign currency. the
group is also exposed to foreign currency fluctuation in its investments in unquoted equity, dollar-denominated bond
instruments, fixed deposits and bank balances in other foreign currencies.

the group’s foreign exchange risk is considered at a group level since an effective overview of such risk is a critical element
of the group’s asset/liability risk management. the board of directors defines its risk tolerance levels and expectations for
foreign exchange risk management and ensures that the risk is maintained at prudent levels.

both the central bank of nigeria and bank of ghana came up with different foreign exchange restriction policies due to the
persistent weakening of the naira and cedi in 2015. prominent of these policies are: the highly debated 41-item list banned
from obtaining foreign exchange at the interbank segment, and the embargo placed on foreign currency denominated cash
deposits. these policies increased the volatility in the parallel market as almost all transactions (tangible and invisible)
were technically denied access to foreign exchange.

the group was adversely affected by these policies as it had to source us dollars in the parallel market to recapitalize wapic
ghana. additionally, wapic ghana’s performance was also adversely affected because of the depreciation of the cedi and
translation losses reported upon consolidation.

foreign exchange risk is quantified using the net balance of assets and liabilities in each currency, and their total sum.
the group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through cash balances maintained in foreign currency. the group is not
exposed to significant risk of adverse movements in foreign exchange rates. the financial position of the company has no
significant sensitivity to foreign exchange risk.

liquidity risk management
liquidity risk is the risk that a company may be unable to meet short term financial demands. this usually occurs due to
the inability to convert a security or hard asset to cash without a loss of capital and / or income in the process. the group
mitigates this risk by monitoring cash activities and expected outflows. the group’s current liabilities arise as claims are
made and clients request for termination of their investment-linked products. the group has zero tolerance for liquidity
risk and is committed to meeting all liabilities as they fall due.

the board approves the group’s liquidity policy and contingency funding plan, including establishing liquidity risk tolerance
levels. the board and its committees, monitors our liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our
liquidity. liquidity positions are measured by calculating the group’s net liquidity gap.

below is a summary of the contractual re-pricing or maturity dates (whichever is earlier) of financial assets matched with
financial liabilities.

quantifications
wapic insurance plc adopts both qualitative and quantitative approaches to measuring liquidity risk. specifically, the
company uses the following techniques;

  a) funding and liquidity plan;
  b) gap analysis; and
  c) ratio analysis.

the funding and liquidity plan defines the group’s sources and channels of utilization of funds. the funding liquidity
risk limit is quantified by calculating liquidity ratios and measuring/monitoring the cumulative gap between our assets
and liabilities. the liquidity gap analysis quantifies the monthly and cumulative gap in a business environment. the
gap for any given tenor bucket represents the liabilities to, or placements made, the market required to replace maturing
liabilities or assets. the company monitors the cumulative gap as a ±20% of the total risk assets and the gap as a ±20% of
total liabilities.

the following table shows the undiscounted cash flows on the group’s financial assets and liabilities, as well as on the
basis of their earliest possible contractual maturity. the gross nominal inflow / (outflow) disclosed in the table is the
contractual, undiscounted cash flow on the financial asset and liability.

     underwriting, claims & reinsurance risk
     underwriting is the process in which an insurer appraises a risk being presented by the proposer and deciding whether or
     not to accept the risk and the consideration (premium) to receive. weaknesses in the systems and controls surrounding the
     underwriting process can expose an insurer to the risk of unexpected losses which may threaten the capital adequacy of the
     insurer. the company’s underwriting process is subject to internal audit.


     underwriting risk management and control:
     risk management department of the company is responsible for the following:

       •   ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements at it relates to underwriting;
       •   coordinate issues tracking activities and ensure action plans are developed for all identified gaps;
       •   collaborate with the underwriting risk committee to develop appetite and tolerance limits;
       •   identify and manage the company’s underwriting risk;

       •   review and approve reinsurance and retrocession arrangements as mandated by naicom.


     insurance risk
     insurance risk is the inherent uncertainty regarding the pricing, adverse selection, product design, net retention, reserving,
     occurrence, amount or timing of insurance liabilities. it also covers the future risk claims and expenses exceeding the value
     placed on insurance liabilities. the timing is specifically influenced by future mortality, longevity, morbidity, persistency
     and expenses about which assumptions are made in order to place a value on the liabilities. the company managed and
     monitored consistently within acceptable limits those exposures assumed in the course of providing insurance cover to
     insured risks.


     managing pricing risk
     a) individual life products – term-assurance and savings plan

     the price for an individual life product is adjusted for the following risk factors:

       •   age;
       •   gender;
       •   smoker status;
       •   medical conditions;
       •   financial condition; and
       •   hazardous pursuits.

     the company employs the following additional controls and measures to ensure that only acceptable risks are accepted
     and risks are appropriately priced:

       •   underwriting controls, with risk classification based on the above risk factors;
       •   regular review of premium rates; and
       •   appropriate policy conditions, including any exclusion on the cover on the individual’s life.
       •   premium rates are guaranteed for the period up to the renewal of a policy, typically, after 1 year.

       b) deposit administration

     premium rating on deposit administration policies distinguishes between the ages and gender of prospective policyholders.
     annual premiums, payable up front, are re-priced at renewal of the deposit administration policies.

c) company life products

underwriting on company’s business is much less stringent than for individual business, as there is typically less scope
for anti-selection. the main reason for this is that participation in the company schemes is normally compulsory and
members have limited choice in the level of the benefits.

company’s policies are priced using standard mortality tables. the price for an individual scheme is adjusted for the
following risk factors:

  •   region;
  •   salary structure;
  •   gender structure; and
  •   industry.

for large schemes, a scheme’s past experience is a crucial input in setting rates for the scheme. rates are guaranteed for
one year and reviewable at the renewal of the policy.

d) short-term insurance (general insurance) products

underwriting on short-term insurance products takes the form of the insurance applicant completing a proposal form. the
company used identified risk factors to classify the risk and charge the appropriate premium.

where the value of the item(s) to be insured exceeds a pre-specified limit, the underwriting consideration becomes more
stringent. this is particularly the case for marine and aviation cover. in this case the company makes use of specialist to
assess the risks and set an appropriate premium for cover.


mortality and morbidity risks
the risk that actual experience in respect of the rates of mortality and morbidity may vary from what is assumed in pricing
and valuation, depending on the terms of different products. the material classes of business most affected by these risks
are discussed below.

a) individual life products – term assurance and savings plan

products are sold directly to individuals providing a benefit on death. the main insurance risk relates to the possibility that
rates of death may be higher than expected.

for contracts with fixed and guaranteed benefits (such as the minimum death benefits available on savings plan policies)
and fixed future premiums, the company employs additional underwriting controls and measures to manage its exposure
to mortality risk. this includes but not limited to:

  •   ensure that only acceptable risks are accepted.
  •   claims assessment processes to ensure only valid claims are paid;
  •   purchased reinsurance to limit liability on particularly large claims or substandard risks; and
  •   concentration risk is reduced by diversification of business over a large number of independent lives, as well as by
      taking out catastrophe reinsurance.

b) company life products

employe benefit products provide life cover to members of a company, such as employees of companies or members of
trade unions.

an aggregate stop-loss reinsurance agreement is in place to ensure that the company’s exposure to the aggregate mortality
risk in its company life business is managed and limited to a specified limit.

in addition, there is a catastrophe reinsurance treaty in place for both company business and individual business. such
a treaty is particularly important for the company’s life business as there are considerably more concentrations of risks
compared to individual business.



                                                                                                                                        63

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




     c) deposit administration

     deposit administration contracts provide a guaranteed life annuity conversion at the maturity of the contract. the mortality
     risk in this case is that the policyholders may live longer than assumed in the pricing of the contract. this is known as the
     risk of longevity.

     the company manages this risk by allowing for improvements in mortality when pricing and valuing the contracts. the
     company also performs more detailed actuarial experience investigations and adjust assumptions in pricing for new
     contracts and valuation of existing contracts when necessary.


     outstanding claims
     this represents the estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims arising from incidents occurring as at the date of the
     statement of financial position.

     claims management risk
     this is the risk that the insurer may be unable to manage the settlement process by which insurers fulfil their contractual
     obligation to policyholders. the company has in place a claims management policy and procedure for ensuring that claims
     are handled fairly and promptly. in establishing and maintaining effective claims handling systems and procedures, the
     company considers the following factors:

       •   appropriate systems and controls to ensure that all liabilities or potential liabilities notified to the insurer are recorded
           promptly and accurately. accordingly, the systems and controls in place ensure that proper records are established
           for each notified claim;
       •   suitable controls are maintained to ensure that estimates for reported claims and additional estimates are
           appropriately made on a consistent basis and are properly categorized;
       •   regular reviews of the actual outcome of the estimates made is carried out to check for inconsistencies and to ensure
           that procedures remain appropriate. the reviews include the use of statistical techniques to compare the estimates
           with the eventual cost of settling the claims, after deducting the amounts already paid at the time the estimates were
           made;
       •   a functional system is in place to ensure that claim files without activity are reviewed on a regular basis;
       •   appropriate systems and procedures are in place to assess the validity of notified claims by reference to the underlying
           contracts of insurance and reinsurance treaties;
       •   suitable systems are adopted to accommodate the use of suitable experts such as loss adjusters, lawyers, actuaries,
           accountants etc. as and when appropriate, and to monitor their use; and
       •   appropriate procedures are in place to identify and handle large or unusual claims, including system to ensure that
           senior management are involved from the outset in the processing of claims that are significant because of their size
           or nature.


     claims experience risk
     in terms of the short-term insurance contracts held by the company, the claims experience risk for these policies is that
     the number of claims and/or the monetary claim amounts are worse than that assumed in the pricing basis. the company
     manages this risk by charging premiums which are appropriate to the risks under the insurance contracts.

     under the short-term insurance products, the company also holds a concentration risk, which is the risk of a large number
     of claims from a single event or in a particular geographical area. the company reduced this risk by diversification over a
     large number of uncorrelated risks, as well as arranged catastrophe reinsurance cover.


     reinsurance risk

technical reserving methods
the provision for outstanding claims, including ibnr, was determined for each line of business on both gross and net
of reinsurance basis. a yearly cohort from year 2006 has been adopted in building the historical claims. the upr was
calculated using a time – apportionment basis, in particular, the 365ths method. the upr is calculated on the assumption
that risk will occur evenly during the duration of the policy. description of insurance reserves by segment.

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




     reinsurance for non-life insurance and life insurance
     wapic’s reinsurance unit keep abreast with risks the company might be exposed to depending on the types of business
     (life / non-life) that have been underwritten in the company. the objective of purchasing reinsurance is to provide market-
     leading capacity for customers while protecting the balance sheet and optimizing wapic’s capital efficiency.


     the unit is guided by the treaty arrangement (both life and non-life) which was effected at the inception of the year for
     all line of insurance business that wapic underwrites, except for motor insurance which has a form of pool arrangement
     with the nigerian liability insurance pool (nlip). the company’s retention limit was increased in 2015 as a result of its
     increased capitalization and improved technical skill. this gives the company the ability to absorb more risk and retain
     a significant and stable portion of premium. the chart below shows that wapic group ceded more premiums to the
     reinsurers in 2015 as compared to 2014, arising out of the increase in large insurance risks written in 2015.

     sensitivity analysis
     sensitivity analyses are performed to test the variability around the reserves that are calculated at a best estimate level. the
     estimated claim amounts can never be an exact forecast of future claim amounts and therefore looking at how these claim
     amounts vary provides valuable information for business planning and risk appetite considerations. a sensitivity analysis
     was done to determine how the ibnr reserve amount would change if we were to consider the 75th percentile as opposed
     to our best estimate figures included in reserve reviews as at 31 december 2015. the 75th percentile is a generally accepted
     level of prudency. the results based on fitting a normal distribution to the best estimate ibnr reserves as at 31 december
     2015 are as follows:

compliance risk
1.       introduction

wapic insurance philosophy is to always comply fully with both the spirit and the letters of all the applicable laws and
regulations governing our activities. compliance risk is the risk of damage to the company’s reputation as a result of failure
(or perceived failure) to comply with relevant laws, regulations, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. in
addition to reputational damage, failure to effectively manage compliance risk can expose the company to fines, civil and
criminal penalties, payment of damages, court orders and suspension or revocation of licenses. a failure (or perceived
failure) can adversely impact customers, staffs and shareholders of wapic insurance plc.

considering the high level of priority the company placed on compliance risk management, the role has direct board
oversight. in this capacity, the board perform the following roles instruments, trade receivables and reinsurance receivables.
the total exposures from the group’s and company’s financial assets to credit risk are as follows:

     a) approve the company’s policies and changes in policies;
     b) monitor the company’s compliance with laws and regulations, its code of conduct and ethics and corporate
        governance practices;
     c) ensure new and changed legal and regulatory requirements are identified, monitored and reflected in company
        processes;
     d) approve the compliance structure, mechanisms and processes established by management to ensure compliance
        with current laws, regulations and supervisory requirements; and
     e) ensure the company has a compliance culture that contributes to the overall objective of risk-management.


2. regulatory environment

naicom released two guidelines which have apparently replaced the 2011 guideline by consolidating the requirements of
2011 guidelines and several other circulars / guidelines into two documents. the two new guidelines (1. market conduct and
business practice and 2. prudential guidelines) released by naicom became effective in june and july 2015 respectively.
these documents have been reviewed and processes have been put in place for the company to comply fully with all the
requirements.

3. our approach

compliance and internal control function has been created to ensure protection of stakeholders not only from regulatory
infractions but also from good business practice perspective. the company recognizes its accountability to all its stakeholders
under the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to its business. compliance and internal control function as well as
every staff of wapic insurance plc and its subsidiaries are committed to high standards of integrity, ethics and fair dealing
in the conduct of business. our risk management philosophy is deepened in the effective convergence risk management
through the ‘three lines of defence’ model.

our approach to compliance risk management is creation of strong compliance and control culture within the company.
we do this by aligning the processes in the company with all the applicable regulatory requirements as well as internal
policies; closely provide regular advisory services to business units in order to achieve the business objectives of the
company without exposing the company or any of its stakeholders to any regulatory or reputational risks.

corporate governance report


introduction
our corporate governance report affords us the opportunity to explain to our stakeholders how our company has been governed during the
year. it reports on how the board has functioned and the workings of our systems and structures of governance.

wapic insurance plc (“wapic” or “the company”) remains committed to implementing the best practice standards of corporate governance.
the company and its subsidiaries (‘the group’) function under a governance frame work that enables the board to discharge its role
of providing oversight and strategic direction in balance with its responsibility to ensure the company’s compliance with regulatory
requirements and acceptable risk.

“the company is mindful of its obligations under the relevant codes of corporate governance such as the national insurance commission
(naicom) code of corporate governance for the insurance industry in nigeria, the securities and exchange commission’s code of
corporate governance (‘the sec code’) and the post listing requirements of the nigerian stock exchange (nse). these, in addition to
its board charter collectively provide the basis for promoting sound corporate governance in the company. our core values of excellence,
professionalism, innovation, sustainability, teamwork, leadership, and empathy are the bedrock upon which we continue to build our
corporate behavior.

performance evaluation
the company’s performance on corporate governance is continuously being monitored. regular reviews are carried
out on the company’s compliance status with the naicom code of corporate governance for the insurance industry
in nigeria, the sec code of corporate governance, and the nse post listing requirements. regular reviews are also
carried out on the company’s compliance status with the various regulatory circulars and guidelines and quarterly
reports are furnished to the board through the board audit and compliance committee, the board enterprise risk
management committee, as well as the board establishment and governance committee.


as part of its commitment to uphold sound corporate governance practices and in compliance with the requirement
of the naicom code of corporate governance, the board has established a system of independent annual evaluation
carried out by an independent consulting firm engaged to carry out an assessment of its own performance, that of its
committees and individual directors. at its annual general meeting (agm), held on april 29, 2015, the shareholders of
the company approved the appointment of accenture limited to facilitate the board performance evaluation. the board
is comfortable that accenture limited provides value-adding and objective evaluation notwithstanding its provision of
strategy consulting assistance to the wapic group. the result of the board performance evaluation is presented to the
board and the individual director’s assessment is communicated and discussed with the chairman. the cumulative
results of the performance of the board and individual directors are considered by the board establishment and
governance committee as a guide in deciding eligibility for re-election.

appointment, retirement and re-election of directors
no non-executive directors were appointed during the year.
the board appointed the following executive director:


 1. ms. adeyinka adekoya executive director                                   * effective date of appointment - 1 november 2015

 ignation of mr. ashish desai. mrs. adeyinka adekoya has a b.sc in insurance and an mba, both from the university of lagos. mrs. adeyinka

     and regulatory regimes in an open manner, for the purpose of deliberating on issues affecting the company’s strategic di-
     rection. this occurs through a fair and transparent process and also serves as a medium for promoting interaction between
     the board, management and shareholders. attendance at the annual general meeting is open to shareholders or their
     proxies, while proceedings at such meetings are usually monitored by members of the press, representatives of the nige-
     rian stock exchange, national insurance commission and the securities and exchange commission. the board ensures
     that shareholders are provided with adequate notice of meetings. an extraordinary general meeting may also be convened
     at the request of the board or shareholders holding not less than 10% of the company’s paid-up capital.

     their right to vote at general meetings. the board also ensures that all shareholders are treated equally regardless of the
     size of their shareholding and social conditions.

     shareholders rights protection
     there is ongoing engagement between executive management and the board, and the heads of relevant strategic business
     units attend board meetings to make presentations. the company’s external auditors attend the board, the board audit
     and compliance committee and the statutory audit committee meetings. the directors have unrestricted access to the
     group management and company information in addition to the resources to carry out their roles and responsibilities.
     this includes access to external professional advice at the company’s expense.


     the board
     the primary obligation of the board of directors is to advance the prosperity of the company by collectively directing
     the company’s affairs, whilst meeting the appropriate interests of shareholders and stakeholders. the board is the
     company’s highest decision making body responsible for governance. it operates on the understanding that sound
     governance practices are fundamental to earning the trust of stakeholders which is critical to sustainable growth.

     appointment process and induction of board members
     the board establishment and governance committee is responsible for recommending new appointments to the board of both executive
     and non-executive directors. when making board appointment recommendations, the committee takes cognizance of the existing range
     of skills, experience, background and diversity on the board in the context of the company’s strategic direction before articulating the
     specification for the candidate sought. we are comfortable that our board is sufficiently diversified to optimize its performance.

     we believe that a robust induction will improve director’s performance. consequently, there is a personalized induction
     program for new directors which include one-on-one meetings with each of the executive directors and senior executives
     responsible for each of the company’s key business areas. such sessions focus on the challenges, opportunities and risks
     facing the business areas. the induction programme covers an overview and review of the strategic business units as well
     as board processes and policies. a new director receives an induction pack comprising of charters, significant reports,
     important legislations as well as policies.


     delegation of authority
     the ultimate responsibility for the company’s operations rests with the board. the board retains effective control through a well-developed
     committee governance structure that provides in-depth focus on board responsibilities. the board delegates authority to the managing
     director and the executive management to manage the affairs of the company within the parameters established by the board from time
     to time. the board meets quarterly and emergency meetings are convened as may be required. the annual calendar of board and board
     committee meetings are approved in advance at the beginning of each financial year and all directors are expected to attend each meeting.
     material decisions may be taken between meetings through written resolutions as provided for by the company’s articles of association. the
     annual calendar of board activities include a board retreat at an offsite location, to consider strategic matters and review the opportunities
     and challenges facing the institution. all directors are provided with notices, agenda and meeting papers in advance of each meeting and
     where a director is unable to attend a meeting he/she is still provided with the relevant papers for the meeting. such director reserves the
     right to discuss with the chairman any matter he/she may wish to raise at the meeting. the directors are also provided with regular updates
     on developments in the regulatory and business environment. the board met 5 times in the 2015 financial year.

     board committees
     the board carries out its oversight function through its standing committees each of which has a charter that clearly defines
     its purpose, composition, and structure, frequency of meetings, duties, tenure and reporting lines to the board. in line with
     best practice, the chairman of the board does not sit on any of the committees. the board’s five standing committees are
     aligned with the provisions of the naicom code of corporate governance for the insurance industry in nigeria and are
     the board enterprise risk management committee, the board audit and compliance committee, the board establishment
     and governance committee, the board investment committee, the board finance and general purpose committee. the

the business experienced some gains resulting from the on-going business model restructuring and transformation of the
service channels embarked upon to reposition the group. these contributed to a 36% (company: 30% increase) increase in
the group’s gross written premium when compared to prior year’s result.


the alterations in the business model also impacted on the net premium income of n3.9 billion which represents an
increase of n961 million over december 2014 results.


the group reported a net insurance claims expenses of n1.64 billion in 2015, an increase of n637 million over december
2014. the company also recorded an increase of n385 million in net claim expenses between 2014 and 2015. the
underwriting result at the end of the year amounted to an underwriting profit of n1.48 billion (company: underwriting
profit of n1.19 billion) compared to an underwriting profit of n1.32 billion (company: loss of n838 million) reported
during the year ended 31 december 2014. the key drivers of the underwriting performance were the increase in premium
income and comparative reduction in net claims expenses underscoring increased efficiency of underwriting risk selection.


investment and other income grew by 59% (company: 97%) a reflection of the group’s strategic direction which leveraged
on investment income as a key revenue source due to the challenging investment environment witnessed during the year.
the growth from n1.82 billion (company: n1.12 billion) in 2014 to n2.89 billion (company: n2.21 billion) in 2015 is a
reflection of the company’s efforts at growing investment portfolio with maximum yields within the challenging investment
environment.


operating expenses for the year totaled n3.46 billion (company: n2.37 billion), representing a 13% increase (company
6%) compared to prior year. as at 31st december 2015, the group had n7.05 billion in the cash and cash equivalents
(company: n3.32 billion), including money market placements of n5.91 billion (company: n2.91 billion) with maturity of
not more than three months.


liquidity, capital resources and risk factors
the group’s cash investment is in accordance with its investments policy which is compliant with regulatory requirements.
the group’s investment strategy during the year was underpinned by a focus on highly liquid financial instruments such
as term deposit, equity and debt instruments. at the end of december 2015, the group had approximately n3.57 billion
invested in fixed income, n0.74 billion in equity instruments and n5.91 billion on money market placements as against
n6.60 billion, n2.19 billion and n4.87 billion respectively for the comparative prior year period as at 31 december 2014.

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




      01. reporting entity


      wapic insurance plc (“wapic” or ‘‘the company”) together with its subsidiaries (collectively “the group”) is a public liability
      company domiciled in nigeria with operations in nigeria and ghana. wapic insurance plc was incorporated on 14 march
      1958 as a private limited liability company under the name of west african provincial insurance company limited.

      it became a public limited liability company in 1990 when the company’s shares were listed on the nigerian stock exchange.
      the company secured a life insurance business license from national insurance commission (naicom) in 2000, and
      became a composite insurance business.

      the company separated the life business and transferred the related assets and liabilities to its subsidiary, intercontinental
      life assurance limited (now wapic life assurance limited), on 1 march 2007 through which it continues to provide life
      assurance services. wapic insurance ghana limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of wapic insurance plc, was incorporated
      on 21 january 2008 to carry on general insurance business in ghana from 19 february 2008.

      the address of the company’s corporate office is 50, awolowo road, ikoyi. the group is principally engaged in the business
      of underwriting life and non-life insurance risks and also issues a diversified portfolio of investment contracts products to
      provide its customers with asset management solutions for their savings and target investment plans.

      going concern
      these financial statements have being prepared on the going concern basis. the group and company has no intention
      or need to reduce substantially its business operations. the management believes that the going concern assumption is
      appropriate for the group and company due to sufficient capital adequacy ratio and projected liquidity, based on historical
      experience that short-term obligations will be refinanced in the normal course of business.

      liquidity ratio and continuous evaluation of current ratio of the group and company is carried out to ensure that there are
      no going concern threats to the operation of the group and company.




      02. basis of preparation

      (a) statement of compliance with international financial reporting standards
      the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with, and comply with, international financial reporting
      standards (ifrs) and ifrs interpretations committee (ifric) interpretations applicable to companies reporting under
      ifrs and in the manner required by companies and allied matters act of nigeria, the insurance act of nigeria, the
      financial reporting council of nigeria act (frc act) and nigerian insurance commission (naicom) guidelines and
      circulars.

      these financial statements were authorised for issue by the company’s board of directors on 29 january 2016.


      (b) functional and presentation currency

(c) basis of measurement
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the following:

  •     financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value;

  •     available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value;

  •     investment properties are measured at fair value;

  •     land and building are carried at revalued amount; and

  •     insurance liabilities are measured at present value of future cashflows.


(d) use of estimates and judgments
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income
and expenses. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.

the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. information about significant
areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect
on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included in note 4 to the financial statements.


(e) regulation
the company is regulated by the naicom under the national insurance act of nigeria. the act specifies certain provisions
which have impact on financial reporting as follows:

  i.    section 20 (1a) provides that provisions for unexpired risks shall be calculated on a time apportionment basis of the
        risks accepted in the year;

  ii.   section 20 (1b) requires provision for outstanding claims to be credited with an amount equal to the total estimated
        amount of all outstanding claims with a further amount representing 10 per centum of the estimated figure for
        outstanding claims in respect of claims incurred but not reported at the end of the year under review. under ifrs
        the incurred but not reported (ibnr) claims are included in the reserves is as determined by the actuary;

  iii. sections 21 (1a) and 22 (1b) require maintenance of contingency reserves for general and life businesses respectively
        at specified rates as set out under note 3.24 to cover fluctuations in securities and variation in statistical estimates;

  iv. section 22 (1a) requires that the maintenance of a general reserve fund (insurance contract fund) which shall be
        credited with an amount equal to the net liabilities on policies in force at the time of the actuarial valuation and an
        additional 25 percent of net premium for every year between valuation date;

  v.    section 24 requires the maintainenance of a margin of solvency to be calculated in accordance with the act.

the frc act provides that in the matters of financial reporting if there is any inconsistency between the frc act and of
other act or law, the frc act shall supercede the other act or law. the frc act provides that ifrs shall be the national
financial reporting framework in nigeria. consequently, the following provision of the national insurance act, which con-
flict with the provisions of ifrs have not been adopted:

  i.    the requirement to provide 10 per cent for outstanding claims in respect of claims incurred but not reported at the
        end of the year under review under section 20 (1b);

  ii.   the requirement for additional provision of 25 per cent of net premium to general reserve fund under section 22 (1a).




                                                                                                                                           109

      3 to all periods presented in these financial statements.

      the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards,
      with a date of initial application are applicable to the group as of 1 january 2015.

           a.    offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities (amendments to ias 32)
           b.    recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets (amendments to ias 36)
           c.    ifric 21 levies

      annual improvements 2010-2012 cycle
      the company has applied these improvements which are all effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 july
      2014 for the first time in these consolidated financial statements. they include:

           i. ifrs 3 - business combination

           ii. ifrs 8 - operating segments

           iii. ias 24 related party disclosures

           iv. ias 16 - property, plant and equipment and ias 38 - intangible assets

           v. ifrs 13 - fair value measurement



      i.        ifrs 3 - business combination

      “the amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that all contingent consideration arrangements classified as
      liabilities (or assets) arising from a business combination should be subsequently measured at fair value through profit or
      loss whether or not they fall within the scope of ias 39. this is consistent with the group’s current accounting policy and,
      thus, this amendment did not impact the group’s accounting policy.

      ii.       ifrs 8 - operating segments

      the amendments are applied retrospectively and clarify that:

           •    an entity must disclose the judgements made by management in applying the aggregation criteria in paragraph
                12 of ifrs 8, including a brief description of operating segments that have been aggregated and the economic
                characteristics (e.g., sales and gross margins) used to assess whether the segments are ‘similar’.


           •    the reconciliation of segment assets to total assets is only required to be disclosed if the reconciliation is reported
                to the chief operating decision maker, similar to the required disclosure for segment liabilities. the group has not
                applied the aggregation criteria in ifrs 8.12. the group has presented the reconciliation of segment assets to total
                assets in previous periods and continues to disclose the same in note 7 in this period’s financial statements as the
                reconciliation is reported to the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of her decision making.


      iii. ias 24 related party disclosures

      the amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies that a management entity (an entity that provides key management
      personnel services) is a related party subject to the related party disclosures. in addition, an entity that uses a management
      entity is required to disclose the expenses incurred for management services. this amendment is not relevant for the
      company as it does not receive any management services from other entities.

iv. ias 16 - property, plant and equipment and ias 38 - intangible assets

both standards are amended to clarify how the gross carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation are treated where
an entity uses the revaluation model. the carrying amount of the asset is restated to the revalued amount. the split between
gross carrying amount and accumulated depreciation is treated in one of the following ways:

     •   either the gross carrying amount is restated in a manner consistent with the revaluation of the carrying amount, and the accumulated
         depreciation is adjusted to equal the difference between the gross carrying amount and the carrying amount after taking into
         account accumulated impairment losses; or

     •   the accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross.


this is consistent with the group’s current accounting policy and, thus, this amendment did not impact the group’s accounting policy.


v.       ifrs 13 - fair value measurement

“the amendment clarifed the consequential amendments to paragraphs b5.4.12 of ifrs 9 and ag79 of ias 39 which meant
that entities no longer had the ability to measure short-term receivables and payables at invoice amounts where the impact
of not discounting is immaterial. the iasb has amended the basis for conclusions of ifrs 13 to clarify that it did not intend
to remove the ability to measure short-term receivables and payables at invoice amounts in such cases. this is consistent
with the company’s current accounting policy and, thus, this amendment did not impact the company’s accounting policy.


annual improvements 2011-2013 cycle
these improvements are effective from 1 july 2014 and the company has applied these amendments for the first time in
these financial statements. they include:

     i. ifrs 3 - business combinations
     ii. ifrs 13 - fair value measurement
     iii. ias 40 - investment property


i.       ifrs 3 - business combination

the amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies for the scope exceptions within ifrs 3. it clarifies that joint
arrangements, not just joint ventures, are outside the scope of ifrs 3. the group does have any joint arrangement.


ii.      ifrs 13 - fair value measurement

the amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that the portfolio exception in ifrs 13 can be applied not only to
financial assets and financial liabilities, but also to other contracts within the scope of ias 39. the group does not apply
the portfolio exception in ifrs 13.


ii. ias 40 - investment property

“the description of ancillary services in ias 40 differentiates between investment property and owner-occupied property (i.e.,
property, plant and equipment). the amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that ifrs 3, and not the description
of ancillary services in ias 40, is used to determine if the transaction is the purchase of an asset or a business combination.
in previous periods, the group has relied on ifrs 3, not ias 40, in determining whether an acquisition is of an asset or is a
business acquisition. thus, this amendment did not impact the accounting policy of the group.




                                                                                                                                                     111

      new standards and interpretations not yet adopted
      the following new or revised standards and amendments which have a potential impact on the company are not yet
      effective for the year ended 31 december 2015 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. however,
      the company’s assessments of the new standards and amendments is that they are not expected to have significant impact
      on the it’s operations and financial position.



       financial assets                              summary of the requirements and possible impact on consolidated financial statements


        ifrs 9: financial instruments                “ifrs 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial
                                                     assets and financial liabilities and introduces new rules for hedge accounting. in july
                                                     2014, further changes were made to the classification and measurement rules and also
                                                     introduced a new impairment model. these latest amendments now complete the new
                                                     financial instruments standard.

                                                     while the company has yet to undertake a detailed assessment of the debt instruments
                                                     currently classified as available-for-sale financial assets, it would appear that they would
                                                     satisfy the conditions for classification as at fair value through other comprehensive
                                                     income (fvoci) based on the current business model for these assets. hence there will
                                                     be no change to the accounting for these assets.

                                                     there will also be no impact on the company’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the
                                                     new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated
                                                     at fair value through profit or loss and the company does not have any such liabilities.
                                                     the new hedging rules align hedge accounting more closely with the company’s risk
                                                     management practices. as a general rule it will be easier to apply hedge accounting going
                                                     forward as the standard introduces a more principles-based approach. the new standard
                                                     also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation.

                                                     the new impairment model is an expected credit loss (ecl) model which may result in
                                                     the earlier recognition of credit losses. the company has no hedging arrangements and
                                                     is yet to assess if/wheter it would be affected by the new impairment provisions rules.

                                                     the company will adopt the standard when it becomes effective on 1 january 2018.

        ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with          “the is the issued new standard for the recognition of revenue. this will replace ias
        customers                                    18 which covers contracts for goods and services and ias 11 which covers construction
                                                     contracts. the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when
                                                     control of a good or service transfers to a customer – so the notion of control replaces
                                                     the existing notion of risks and rewards. the standard permits a modified retrospective
                                                     approach for the adoption. under this approach entities will recognise transitional
                                                     adjustments in retained earnings on the date of initial application (eg 1 january 2017), ie
                                                     without restating the comparative period. they will only need to apply the new rules to
                                                     contracts that are not completed as of the date of initial application.

                                                     management is currently assessing the impact of the new rules and has identified that
                                                     the standard is not expected to have significant impact on the company’s financial
                                                     statements. the company will adopt the standard on its mandatority effective date of 1
                                                     january 2017.

the following new or amended standards that have been issued but not yet effective are not expected to
have a significant impact of the company’s financial statements.

the company’s assessments of the expected new standards and amendments is that they are not expected to have significant
impact on the it’s operations and financial position because it is not significantly exposed to their requirements.

3. significant accounting policies

except for the changes explained above, the significant accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to
all periods presented in these financial statements.


3.1   cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and at bank, call deposits and short term highly liquid financial assets with
original maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date, which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in
their fair value and are used by the company in the management of its short-term commitments.

cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost in the statement of financial position.




                                                                                                                                             113

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




      3.2       financial instruments

      i.        financial assets


           a.    classification


                 the company’s financial assets include cash and short term deposits, commercial loan, quoted and unquoted equity
                 instruments, treasury bills and bonds. the classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the
                 assets were acquired or originated. the company classifies its financial assets into the following categories:

                 •   financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;
                 •   held-to-maturity;
                 •   loans and receivable, and;
                 •   available-for-sale


           b.    initial recognition


                 all financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value, which includes directly attributable transaction costs
                 for financial instruments not classified at fair value through profit and loss. financial instruments are derecognized
                 when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial instruments have expired or where the company has
                 transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.


           c.    subsequent measurement


                 subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets are measured either at fair value or amortised cost, depending on
                 their categorization as follows:

                 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

                 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets
                 designiated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.

                 financial assets classified as held for trading are acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term for
                 profit purposes.

                 subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets as fair value through profit or loss investments are re-measured
                 at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in this value recognized in the profit or loss in the period
                 in which they arise.

                 the fair values of quoted instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of unquoted
                 instruments are determined by reference to an active markets or valuation techniques. interest earned and dividends
                 received while holding trading assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the profit or loss.

                 the company holds financial assets designiated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss in addition
                 to those financial assets held for trading.

held-to-maturity

held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed determinable payments and fixed
maturities that management has both the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity other than:

•   those that the company designates as available for sale;

•   those that upon initial recognition has been designated as at fair value through profit or loss; and;

•   those that meet the definition of loans and receivables.

such instruments as government bonds, corporate bonds and treasury bills are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less impairment allowance, if any.

held to maturity investments are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate.the company consider tainted any financial assets classified as held to maturity, if during the current
financial year or the two preceding financial years, it has sold or reclassified more than an insignificant amount of
the held-to-maturity investments before maturity (more than insignificant in relation to the total amount of held-
to-maturity investments) other than sales or reclassifications that:

•   are so close to maturity or the financial asset’s call date (for example, less than three months before maturity)
    that changes in the market rate of interest would not have a significant effect on the financial asset’s fair value;

•   occur after substantially all of the financial asset’s original principal has been collected through scheduled
    payments or prepayments; or

•   are attributable to an isolated event that is beyond the company’s control, is non-recurring and could not have
    been reasonably anticipated by the company.

available-for-sale

available for sale financial investments include equity and debt securities. the company classifies as available-
for-sale those financial assets that are generally not designated as another category of financial assets and strategic
capital investments held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or
changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.

available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value. fair values for quoted instruments are determined in the
same manner as those of instruments at fair value through profit or loss. the fair values of unquoted equities and
other instruments for which there is no active market, are established using valuation techniques corroborated by
independent third parties. these inputs may include reference to the current fair value of other instruments that are
substantially similar in terms of underlying cash flows and risk characteristics.

available for sale equity instruments for which fair value cannot be reliably determined are carried at cost less
impairment allowance, if any.

unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised
in other comprehensive income while the investment is held, and are subsequently transferred to the profit or loss
statement upon sale or de-recognition of the instrument. when available for sale instruments are impaired, the
result of loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

dividends received on available-for-sale instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the company’s right
to receive payment has been established. interest income on available for sale instruments are recognised in the
statement of profit or loss.

loans and receivables

“loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted
in an active market, other than those classified by the company as at fair value through profit or loss or available-
for-sale.




                                                                                                                                 115

             loans and receivables consist primarily of staff loans, premium debtors, due from reinsurers, other debtors.

             loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment
             losses. loans granted to staff at below market rates are fair valued by reference to expected future cash flows and
             current market interest rates for instruments in a comparable or similar risk class and the difference between the
             historical cost and fair value is accounted for as employee benefits under staff costs where these are considered
             material.

       d.    impairment of financial assets


             the carrying amounts of these assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective
             evidence of impairment. a financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or
             more events that have occurred since the initial recognition of the asset have had a negative effect on the estimated
             future cash flows of that asset and can be reliably estimated.


             observable data or evidence that the company uses to determine if an impairment allowance is required on a
             financial asset include:

             •   significant financial difficulty of a counter party;
             •   a breach of contract such as default of contractual terms or delinquency in interest or principal payment;
             •   it is probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization;
             •   observable data which indicates that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flow from a company
                 of assets since the initial recognition of those assets although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual
                 financial assets.

             in addition, for an available-for-sale financial asset, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost
             is also considered objective evidence of impairment. while the determination of what is significant or prolonged is
             a matter of judgment. in respect of equity securities that are quoted, the company is guided by the following:

             •    a decline is generally regarded as significant if it represent substantial fall in value below cost and

             •   a decline in quoted price is considered to be prolonged if decline persists for more one financial year.

             loans and receivables and held-to-maturity financial instruments

             for financial assets measured at amortised cost, the group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists
             individually for financial assets that are individually significant and or collectively for the entire portfolio or class of
             financial assets. individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. the remaining
             financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.

             “when there is objective evidence of impairment, the amount of the impairment loss determined is measured as the
             difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future
             credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective
             interest rate computed at initial recognition). the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through an allowance account.
             the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

             impairment reversals in a subsequent period arising as a result of decreases in the amount of the impairment loss is
             recognised where the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the
             previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account. the reversal is reinstated as far it
             does not result in the carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the amortised cost would have been had
             the initial impairment not been recognised.

          available for sale instruments

          available-for-sale financial assets are impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment, resulting from one or more
          loss events that occurred after initial recognition but before the reporting date, that have an impact on the future cash
          flows of the asset.

          all impairment losses are recognized through profit or loss. if any loss on the financial asset was previously recognized
          directly in equity as a reduction in fair value, the cumulative net loss that had been recognized in equity is transferred to
          the statement of profit or loss and is recognized as part of the impairment loss. the amount of the loss recognized in the
          statement of profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost in the case of equity instruments or amortised
          cost in the case of debt instruments and the current fair value, less any previously recognized impairment loss in the profit
          or loss.

          for debt instruments subsequent decreases in the amount relating to an impairment loss, that can be linked objectively
          to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in the profit or loss, is reversed through the statement
          of profit or loss. an impairment loss in respect of an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed
          through the statement of profit or loss.

          when an available-for-sale financial instrument is carried at cost because fair value is not reliably measured, an
          impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of estimated future
          cash flows discounted at current market rate of return for similar instruments.

ii.      financial liabilities

          the company’s financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities at amortised cost. they include: investment
          contract liabilities, trade and other payables.

          subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value while
          other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.

          in accordance with ias 39, all financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) have to be
          recognized in the financial statements and measured in accordance with their assigned categories. the table below
          represents the company’s classification of all its financial assets and liabilities:


                         category                                    classes as determined by the company                         subclasses

      iii.   fair value measurement

              fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
              between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or in its absence, the most advantageous market
              to which the group has access at that date. the fair value of a liability reflects its non performance risk.

              when available, the group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that
              instrument. a market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and
              volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

              if there is no quoted price in an active market, then the group uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of
              relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. the chosen valuation technique incorporates
              all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. valuation techniques include
              using recent arm’s length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, reference to the
              current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing
              models. where an appropriate and reliable valuation technique can not be achieved the instrument is carried at cost.

              the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price, i.e. the
              fair value of the consideration paid or received. if the group determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs
              from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical
              asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the financial
              instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value at initial recognition
              and the transaction price. subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over
              the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the
              transaction is closed out. if an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the group
              measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price or at the price that best
              present the financial instrument.

              the fair value of a demand deposit is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date on
              which the amount could be required to be paid. the group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy
              as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.

      iv.     write-off policy

              the group writes off a financial asset (and any related allowances for impairment losses) when it determines that the
              assets are uncollectible. this is determined after consideration of information such as significant changes in the issuer’s
              financial position such that the issuer can no longer pay the obligation or charge off decisions generally based on specific
              past due status considerations.


      iv.     trade receivables

              trade receivables are loans and receivables financial instruments specifically arising from insurance contracts and
              constitutes premium debtors with determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and the group has
              no intention to sell. trade receivables on insurance contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently
              measured at amortised cost less impairment. trade receivables are recognised for insurance cover for which payments
              have been received indirectly through duly licensed insurance brokers or lead insurers in co-insurance arrangements.
              premium collected on behalf of the group are expected to be received within 30 days from insurance brokers and lead
              insurers. trade receivables that are individually identified as impaired are assessed for specific impairment. all other
              trade receivables are assessed for collective impairment.


      3.3    reinsurance assets and reinsurance liabilities

      trade receivables are loans and receivables financial instruments specifically arising from insurance contracts and
      constitutes premium debtors with determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and the group has no
      intention to sell. trade receivables on insurance contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured
      at amortised cost less impairment. trade receivables are recognised for insurance cover for which payments have been

                                                                                                                 annual report & accounts




received indirectly through duly licensed insurance brokers or lead insurers in co-insurance arrangements. premium
collected on behalf of the group are expected to be received within 30 days from insurance brokers and lead insurers. trade
receivables that are individually identified as impaired are assessed for specific impairment. all other trade receivables are
assessed for collective impairment.


3.5   deferred acquisition costs (dac)

acquisition costs comprise insurance commissions, brokerage and other related underwriting expenses arising from the
generation and underwriting of insurance contracts. deferred acquisition costs represent a proportion of commission and
underwriting expenses which are incurred during a financial period and are deferred to the extent that they are recoverable
out of future revenue margins.


the proportion of these acquisition costs that correspond to the unearned premiums are deferred as an asset and amortised
over the life of the associated insurance contracts on a basis consistent with the related unearned portion of the premiums.


for non life business and short-duration life insurance contracts, the group amortises the deferred acquisition costs over
the terms of the policies as premium is earned on the underlying insurance contracts by applying to the acquisition expenses
the ratio of unearned premium to written premium. for long-term life insurance contracts no assets are established in
respect of deferred acquisition cost. however, an allowance for acquisition cost loading is provided for in the valuation of
the insurance contract liabilities using assumptions consistent with those used in calculating future policy benefit liabilities
as well as historical and anticipated future experience and is updated at the end of each accounting period.


3.5   other receivables and prepayments

other receivables are stated after deductions of amount considered bad or doubtful of recovery. these are loans and
receivables other than investment securities, insurance trade receivables and reinsurance assets. when a debt is deemed
not collectible, it is written-off against the related provision or directly to profit or loss account to the extent not previously
provided for. any subsequent recovery of written-off debts is credited to profit or loss.


prepayments represent prepaid expenses and are carried at cost less amortisation expensed in profit or loss.


3.6   basis of consolidation

      (a) subsidiaries

      investment in subsidiaries are carried in the company’s separate financial statements at cost less allowance for
      impairment.


      subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. the group controls an entity if it is exposed to, or has rights to,
      variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power
      over the investee. the consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of the group and
      subsidiary undertakings. the financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements
      from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. the financial statements have been prepared
      using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.


      investment in subsidiary are carried at cost in the group’s separate financial statements and are reviewed for
      impairment annually. an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds
      its recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.


      the results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary
      economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation
      currency as follows:



                                                                                                                                            119

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




       •   assets and liabilities for statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting
           date;

       •   income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income are translated at average
           exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing
           on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions);
           and

       •   all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred to equity.


           on the disposal of a foreign operation, the group recognises in profit or loss the cumulative amount of exchange
           differences relating to that foreign operation. when a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation is partially disposed
           of or sold, the group re-attributes the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences
           recognised in other comprehensive income to the non controlling interests in that foreign operation. in the case of
           any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the group reclassifies to profit or loss only the proportionate share
           of the cumulative amount of exchange differences recognised in other comprehensive income.


           (b) transactions eliminated on consolidation

           intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealized gains or losses arising from intra-group transactions are
           eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as
           unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.


           (c) associates

           investment in associates are carried in the company’s separate financial statements at cost less allowance for
           impairment and consolidated in the group’s consolidated financial statements under the equity accounting
           method.


           associates are entities over which the group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a
           shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. investment in associates are accounted for using the
           equity accounting method. under the equity accounting the method, the investment is initially recognised at cost,
           and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the post-acquisition profit
           or loss and other comprehensive income of the investee. the group’s investment in associates includes goodwill
           identified on acquisition while gains realised on purchase below fair value are recognised in profit or loss.


           the group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of the
           post-acquisition movement in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with
           corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. when the group’s share of losses in an associate
           equals or exceeds its interest in the associates, including any unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise
           further losses, unless it has incurred constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.


           the group determine at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the
           associate is impaired. the amount of impairment is determined as the difference between the recoverable amount of
           the associate and its carrying value. this amount is recognised against the share of profit or loss of associates in the
           income statement.


           on disposal of ownership interest in an associate which reduces holding but where significant influence in retained,
           only a proportionate share of the amount previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit
           or loss where appropriate, where significant influenced is lost, the investment is reclassified as equity investment and
           the amount previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss.

      (d) elimination of upstream and downstream transactions

      profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the group and its associate are
      recognised in the group’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the associate.
      unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction present evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
      accounting policies of the associate are reviewed and aligned to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the
      group. dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in income statement.


3.7 investment property

investment property comprises investment in land or buildings held primarily to earn rentals or capital appreciation or
both.


investment property is initially recognized at cost including transaction costs. the carrying amount includes the cost of
replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met; and
excludes cost of day to day servicing of an investment property. investment property is subsequently measured at fair value
with any change therein recognised in profit or loss. fair values are determined individually, on a basis appropriate to the
purpose for which the property is intended and with regard to recent market transactions for similar properties in the same
location.


fair values are reviewed annually by independent valuer, registered with the financial reporting council of nigeria and
holding a recognized and relevant professional qualification and with relevant experience in the location and category of
investment property being valued. subsequent expenditure on investment property is capitalized only if future economic
benefit will flow to the group; otherwise they are expensed as incurred.


investment properties are disclosed separate from the property and equipment used for the purposes of the business. the
group separately accounts for a dual purpose property as investment property if it occupies only an insignificant portion
and the related value can be separately identifiable and measured reliably. otherwise, the portion occupied by the group
is treated as property and equipment.


3.8   intangible assets

      software

      recognition of software acquired is only allowed if it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to this
      intangible asset will flow to the company.

      software acquired is initially measured at cost. the cost of acquired software comprises its purchase price, including
      any import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable expenditure on preparing the
      asset for its intended use. after initial recognition, software acquired is carried at its cost less any accumulated
      amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. maintenance costs should not be included.

      internally developed software is capitalized when the company has the intention and demonstrates the ability to
      complete the development and use of the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits, and can
      reliably measure the costs to complete the development. the capitalized costs include all costs directly attributable
      to the development of the software. internally developed software is stated at capitalized cost less accumulated
      amortization and impairment.

      subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits
      embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. all other expenditure is expensed as incurred. amortization is
      recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, from the date that it
      is available for use.

      the estimated useful life of software is five years subject to annual reassessment.




                                                                                                                                          121

      3.9   property and equipment
            recognition and measurement

            all items of property and equipment except land and buildings are initially recognised at cost and subsequently
            measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. cost includes expenditures that are directly
            attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

            land and buildings are initially recognised at cost and subsequently carried at revalued amounts, being fair value at
            the date of revaluation less subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.

            when parts of an item of property or equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items
            (major components) of property and equipment.

            the gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from
            disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment, and are recognised net within other income in profit
            or loss.

            subsequent costs

            subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only
            when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of
            the item can be measured reliably. all other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the profit and loss account
            during the financial period in which they are incurred.

            subsequent costs on replacement parts on an item of property are recognized in the carrying amount of the asset and
            the carrying amount of the replaced or renewed component is derecognized.

            depreciation

            depreciation is calculated on property and equipment on the straight line basis to write down the cost of each asset to
            its residual value over its estimated useful life. depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed
            at each reporting date. no depreciation is charged on property and equipment until they are available for use.

            land                                                                                 over the lease period

            buildings                                                                            over 50 years

            office equipment                                                                     over 5 years

            computer hardware                                                                    over 3 years

            furniture and fittings                                                               over 5 years

            motor vehicles                                                                       over 4 years


            revaluation of land and building

            land and building is accessed for impairment at each reporting date but valued on an open market basis by qualified
            property valuers at the reporting date at minimum of once within three financial years.

            when an individual property is revalued, any increase in its carrying amount (as a result of revaluation) is transferred
            to a revaluation reserve, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same property previously
            recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss.

            when the value of an individual property is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease is charged against any
            related credit balance in the revaluation reserve in respect of that property. however, to the extent that it exceeds any
            surplus, it is recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss.

                                                                                                              annual report & accounts




      work-in-progress property and equipment

      this represent property and equipment under construction and are carried at the cost incurred until completion.
      work-in-progress property and equipment are transferred to the appropriate class of property and equipment upon
      completion when they are ready for use and are depreciated from the date of transfer when they are brought into use.
      decognition

      an item of property and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or where no future economic benefits are
      expected from its use or disposal. gains and losses arising on derecognition are calculated as the difference between
      the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss as other income.
      where a revalued asset is disposed or scrapped, the revaluation reserve balance in respect of that asset is transferred
      as a reserve reclassification from other reserves to retained earnings.


3.10 leases

      operating leases

      leases where the lessor retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset are classified as operating
      leases. payments made under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period of
      the lease.

      finance leases

      leases of equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
      leases. finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or
      the present value of the minimum lease payments. each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance
      charges so as to achieve a constant interest rate on the outstanding balance of the liability.


      the corresponding lease obligations, net of finance charges, are included in liabilities. the finance cost is charged
      to profit or loss over the lease period according to the effective interest method. the equipment acquired under the
      finance lease is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term, if ownership does not
      pass at the end of the lease term. leased assets under finance leases where ownership is expected to pass to the group
      at the end of the lease term are treated in the same manner as property and equipment.


3.11 impairment of non-financial assets

the carrying amounts of the group’s non-financial assets are considered to be impaired when there exist any indication that
the asset’s recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount and are at a minimum assessed for impairment annually.
the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. for the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which they are separately identifiable cashflows (cash generating
units). impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.


impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has
decreased or no longer exists. an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine
the recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that
the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. reversals of impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.


3.12 deferred tax

deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. however, if the deferred tax arises
from initial recognition of the asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. deferred tax is determined using the
tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to
apply when the related deferred asset tax is realisable or the deferred tax liability is payable.

                                                                                                                                         123

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




      deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is possible that future profit will be available against which the
      temporary differences can be utilised.


      deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the
      group controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will
      not reverse in the foreseeable future.


      deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
      current tax liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
      authority on either the taxable entity or different entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
      the tax effects of carry-forwards of unused losses or unused tax credits are recognised as an asset when it is probable that
      future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.


       deferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of available-for-sale investments, which are charged or credited directly
      in other comprehensive income, is also credited or charged to other comprehensive income and subsequently recognised
      in the consolidated income statement together with the deferred gain or loss.


      3.13   life insurance contract liabilities
      the group issues contracts that transfer insurance risk or financial risk or both. insurance contracts are when the group
      (the insurer) has accepted significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate
      the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder. as a general
      guideline, the group defines as significant insurance risk the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of the
      insured event that are at least 10% more than the benefit payable if the insured event did not occur.


      non-life insurance contracts are issued to indemnity against property and liability insurance risk and are generally annual
      in tenor although some contracts can be beyond one year. these are short term insurance risks.


      life insurance contracts are issued to indemnify the insured life, the dependent or other third-party of the insured life in
      the even of death, permanent disability, loss of job or on survival to maturity of the contract with the sums assured.


      investment contracts are those contracts that transfer financial risk and no significant insurance risk. financial risk is
      the risk of possible future change in one or more of a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price,
      foreign exchange rate, index of price or rates, credit rating or credit index or other variable, provided in the case of a non-
      financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract.


      once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, it remains an insurance contract for the remainder of its
      lifetime, even if the insurance risk reduces significantly during this period, unless all rights and obligations are extinguished
      or expired. investment contracts can, however, be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if the terms are
      amended to include significant insurance risk.


      receipts and payments under investment contracts are not classified as insurance transactions in the income statement,
      but instead are accounted for in the statement of financial position in accordance with ias 39. the liability recognised in
      the statement of financial position represents the expected amounts payable to the holders of the investment contracts
      inclusive of allocated investment income. insurance contract liabilities are determined in line with the provisions of section
      20, 21 and 22 of the insurance act of nigeria to the extent that they do not conflict with the requirements of ifrs as follows:

             (a) general insurance contracts: measurement of insurance contracts liabilities

             (i) reserve for unearned premium and unexpired risk

             the reserve for unearned premium is calculated on a time apportionment basis in respect of risk accepted during the
             year. a provision for additional unexpired risk reserve is recognised for an underwriting year where it is envisaged
             that the estimated cost of claims and expenses would exceed the unearned premium reserve.

                                                                                                      annual report & accounts




(ii) reserve for outstanding claims


the reserve for outstanding claims is maintained at the total amount of outstanding claims incurred and reported
plus claims incurred but not reported (ibnr) at the reporting date.

reserving methodology and assumptions
data segmentation

the data used for reserving is segmented into the 8 classes as per the insurance act 2003 of nigeria:
• motor vehicle insurance business
• fire insurance business
• general accident insurance business
• marine, aviation and transport insurance business
• oil and gas insurance business
• engineering
• bonds, credit and suretyship
• miscellaneous

valuation methods and assumptions

the following valuation methods are used as appropriate in calculating the reserves:

(i) the basic chain ladder method

this model assumes that past experience is indicative of future experience, i.e. that claims reported to date will
continue to develop in a similar manner in the future. an implicit assumption is that, for an immature accident year,
the claims observed thus far tells something about the claims yet to be observed. a further assumption is that it
assumes consistent claim processing, a stable mix of types of claims, stable inflation and stable policy limits.

this method is used for cases where there are extremely large losses that have been reported but not paid, and therefore
will not influence the development patterns. the ibnr was calculated as follows; the reserving was determined
as ultimate claim amount (excluding extreme large losses) minus claims paid to date (excluding extremely large
losses) minus claims outstanding (excluding extreme large losses). this method was used for the following classes of
business; motor vehicle, fire, general accident, marine, engineering and miscellaneous.


(ii) loss ratio method, adjusted for assumed experience to date.

this model assumes that the average delay in the payment of claims will continue into the future. if it is expected that
these delay assumptions no longer hold, an adjustment needs to be made to allow for this change in payment delay.
if the delay period in payment is expected to have increased from previous years, the results shown in this report will
be understated. additionally, an estimate of the average ultimate loss ratio was assumed. the assumption for the
ultimate loss ratio was based on estimated average loss ratio on claims experience to date for accident years 2006 to
2015. the loss ratio method was used for three classes namely oil and gas, bonds and aviation which had very limited
data, and where use of the basic chain ladder method was inappropriate.

the model allowed for expected experience to date within the assumed delay period and the assumed average ultimate
loss ratios in carrying out the calculation. the average delay is the average number of months that it takes for a claim
to be paid after the loss incident occurred. the ibnr was calculated as follows; expected average ultimate loss ratio
for the assumed average delay period x earned premium for the assumed delay period- current experience to date
relating to the accident months that the delay implies.

discounting

no allowance has been made for discounting as these reserves are for short term contracts, the effect of discounting
is not expected to have a significant impact on the reserves.


                                                                                                                                 125

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




           sensitivity analysis

           sensitivity analyses are performed to test the variability around the reserves that are calculated at the best estimate
           level. the sensitivity analysis is done to determine how the ibnr reserve amount would change if a 75th percentile
           is considered as opposed to the best estimate figures included in reserve reviews as at 31 december 2015. the 75th
           percentile is a generally accepted level of prudency.


           (b) life insurance contracts: measurement of insurance contracts liabilities

           (i) life fund

           this is made up of net liabilities on policies in force as determined by qualified actuaries at the reporting date. surplus
           or deficit arising from the periodic valuation of the life insurance contracts are recognised in the income statement.


           this is made up of liabilities on life policies in force as determined by qualified actuaries at the reporting date.
           surplus or deficit arising from the periodic valuation of the life insurance contracts are recognised in profit and loss.

           the reserves include incurred but not reported (ibnr) and unearned premium reserve (upr).

           the group does not have contracts with discretionary participating features.

           data segmentation

           the data used for reserving is segmented into the 2 classes as follows:

           • individual business
           • group business

           methodologies and assumptions

           the valuation for both the individual business and group business utilises various assumptions which include:

           • the valuation age is taken as age last birthday at the valuation date;

           • the period to maturity is taken as the full term of the policy less the expired term.

           • full credit is given to premiums due between valuation date and the end of the premium paying term.


           for all individual risk business, the gross premium method of valuation was used. reserves were calculated via a
           cashflow projection approach, taking into account future office premiums, expenses and benefit payments. future
           cashflows were discounted back to the valuation date at the valuation rate of interest.

           an unexpired premium reserve (upr) was included for group life business after allowing for acquisition expenses at
           a ratio of 20% of premium. the upr is tested against an additional unexpired risk reserve (aurr) for adequacy
           and an aurr may also be held to allow for any inadequacies in the upr for meeting claims in respect of the unexpired
           period. the claim rates underlying the aurr were based on pooled historical scheme claims experience. allowance
           was made for ibnr (incurred but not reported) claims in group life to take care of the delay in reporting claims.
           this was based on a loss ratio approach, which uses historical claims experience to estimate the expected claims, from
           which the ibnr portion is determined.


           (c) general insurance: insurance contracts revenue recognition

           the recognition and measurement of the insurance contracts in the group’s general business are set out as follows:


           (i) premiums income

           gross premium relates to premium written in a year to cover assumed insurance risk. gross premiums comprise the
           premiums on insurance contracts entered into during the year, irrespective of whether they relate in whole or in part
           to a later accounting period.




126

                                                                                                        annual report & accounts




premiums on reinsurance inward from facultative reinsurance arrangement are included in gross written premiums
and accounted for as if ceded business was direct business, taking into account the product classification of the
reinsured business.

outward reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the premiums for the related
direct insurance or reinsurance business assumed.

the earned portion of premiums written is recognized as revenue. premiums are earned from the date of attachment
of risk, over the indemnity period, based on the pattern of risk underwritten. outward reinsurance premiums are
recognized as an expense in accordance with the pattern of the indemnity.

(ii) unearned premiums

unearned premiums are those proportions of premiums written in the year that relate to periods of risks after the
reporting date. it is computed separately for each insurance contract using a time proportionate basis, or another
suitable basis for uneven risk contracts.

(iii) reinsurance cost

the group cedes insurance risks in the normal course of business for the purpose of limiting its potential net loss
on policies written. premium ceded comprise written premiums ceded to reinsurers, adjusted for the reinsurers’
share of the movement in the provision for the unearned premiums; the prepaid reinsurance cost. reinsurance
arrangements do not relieve the group from its direct obligations to its policyholders. subsequently, premium ceded,
claims reimbursed and commission recovered are presented in profit or loss and the statement of financial position
separately from the gross amounts. reinsurance recoverable are recognized when the group records the liability
for the claims and are not netted off claims expense but are presented separately in profit or loss as part of claims
expenses recoverable.

(iv) fees and commission

fee and commissions are recognized on ceding business to reinsurance. commissions are amortised and credited to
the profit or loss account over the period of the reinsurance contract.

(iv) claims incurred

“claims incurred consist of claims and claims handling expenses paid during the financial year together with the
movement in the provision for outstanding claims and these are recognised in the profit or loss. the provision for
outstanding claims represent the group’s estimate of the ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the
reporting date whether reported or not. the provision includes an allowance for claims management and handling
expenses.

the provision for outstanding claims is estimated based on current information and the ultimate liability may vary
as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amounts provided.
adjustments to the amounts of claims provision for prior years are reflected in the profit or loss in the financial period
in which adjustments are made, and disclosed separately if material.

claims on general insurance contracts are payable on a claims-occurrence basis. the group recognise liability for all
insured events that occurred during the term of the contract. there are several variables that affect the amount and
timing of cash flows from these contracts. these mainly relate to the inherent risks of the business activities carried
out by individual contract holders and the risk management procedures they adopted.

the estimated cost of claims includes direct expenses to be incurred in settling claims, net of the expected subrogation
value and other recoveries. the group takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has appropriate information
regarding its claims exposures. however, given the uncertainty in establishing claims provisions, it is likely that the
final outcome will prove to be different from the original liability established.

the reserves held for these contracts comprises a provision for ibnr, a provision for reported claims not yet paid and
a provision for unearned premiums at the end of the reporting period.




                                                                                                                                   127

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




           (v) salvage and subrogation reimbursement

           some insurance contracts permit the group to sell (usually damaged) property acquired in settling a claim for example
           and make salvage recovery on them. the group may also have the right to pursue third parties for payment of some
           or all costs for example in a subrogation. a subrogation represent the portion of claims incurred expected to be
           recovered from negligent third-party or the third-party insurance group.

           salvaged property is recognized in profit or loss when the amount that can reasonably be recovered from the disposal
           of the property has been established and are included as part of claims recoveries. subrogation reimbursements are
           recognized in claim recoveries when the amount to be recovered from the liable third party has been established.

           (vi) deferred income

           deferred income represents a portion of commissions received on reinsurance contracts during the financial year but
           are deferred based on the tenor of the underlying contracts. it is calculated by applying the reinsurance commission
           income ratio of prepaid reinsurance to reinsurance cost.

           (vii) deferred acquisition cost

           acquisition costs comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the origination of insurance contracts; commission
           and maintenance expenses. deferred acquisition costs represent portion of commissions which are incurred during a
           financial year and are deferred to the extent that they are recoverable out of future revenue margins. it is calculated
           by applying the ratio of unearned premium to written premium.


           (c) life insurance: insurance contracts revenue recognition

           (i) risk premiums on life assurance

           premiums and annuity considerations written and/or receivable under insurance contracts are stated gross of
           commission and recognised when due. outward reinsurance premiums are recognised when due for payment.
           premium written relates to risks assumed during the period.

           (ii) claims on life assurance

           claims recognised include maturities, surrenders, death and disability payments. claims arising on maturities are
           recorded as they fall due for payments. death, disability and surrenders are accounted for on notification. reinsurance
           recoveries are accounted for when the group records the liability for the claims.

           (iii) insurance contract provisions on life assurance

           insurance contract provisions are determined using valuation basis adopted in accordance with the generally accepted
           actuarial practices and methodologies as set out in note 3.16 (b).

           the gross insurance contract provisions and related reinsurance recoveries are estimated on the basis of the
           information currently available to the group. the ultimate liability may vary as a result of subsequent information
           and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amount provided.


           (d) classification of insurance contracts of the group

           (i) short term insurance contracts

           short term insurance contracts are annual insurance contracts. this comprised mainly of the group’s general insurance
           business and the life insurance business group life products; for which the gross premium relates to premium written
           to cover assumed annual insurance risk liability.


           for all these contracts, premiums are recognized as revenue proportionally over the period of coverage. the portion
           of premium received on in-force contracts that relates to unexpired risk at the end of reporting date is reported as the
           unearned premium liability.

                                                                                                             annual report & accounts




     (ii) long term insurance contracts

     long term insurance contracts are insurance contracts which provide insurance cover over a long duration, generally
     more than one annual insurance period. this comprises mainly of the group’s life insurance business individual life
     products; for which the gross premium relates to premium written to cover assumed insurance risk liability covering
     more than one insurance period. these contracts insure events associated with human life (for example, death or
     survival) over a long duration.


3.14 liability adequacy test of insurance contracts liabilities and related assets

the liability for insurance contracts is tested for adequacy by discounting current estimates of all future contractual cash
flows and comparing this amount to the carrying value of the liability net of deferred acquisition costs. where a shortfall is
identified, an additional provision is made and the group recognizes the deficiency in the profit or loss. insurance contract
liabilities are subject to liability adequacy testing on an annual basis. the method of valuation and assumptions used, the
cashflows considered and the discounting and aggregation practices adopted have been set out as part of note 3.16(a) and
3.16(b).


3.15 investment contract liabilities

contracts under which the transfer of insurance risk to the group from the policy holder is not significant are classified as
investment contracts. such contracts include savings and /or investment contracts sold with insignificant or without life
assurance protection. these contracts transfer financial risk but insignificant insurance risk.

amounts received under investment contracts are recognised directly as investment contract liabilities.

investment contract liabilities are reported at amortised cost and are assessed for adequacy at each reporting date.


3.16 trade and other payables

trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. the fair value of a non-interest bearing liability is its discounted repayment amount. if the due
date is less than one year, discounting is omitted as the impact is not expected to be significant.


3.17 provisions

a provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be
estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.


provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.


3.18 income tax

income tax comprises current and deferred tax. income tax expense or credit is recognised in the profit or loss except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.


3.19 dividends

dividend distribution to the group’s shareholders is recognized as a liability in the financial statements in the period
in which the dividends are approved by the group’s shareholders. dividends that are proposed but not yet declared are
disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. dividends on the group’s ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the
period in which they are paid or, if earlier, approved by the group’s shareholders.


3.20 share capital and premium

the company classifies ordinary shares and share premium as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other
assets. incremental costs directly attributable to issue of shares are recognized as deductions from equity net of any tax
effects.


                                                                                                                                        129

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




      3.21 share premium

      share premiums are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets. incremental costs
      directly attributable to the issue of equity instruments are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.


      3.22 contingency reserve

      the group maintains contingency reserves in accordance with the provisions of the insurance act 2003 to cover fluctuations
      in securities and variations in statistical estimates. for general business, the reserve is calculated at the rate equal to the
      higher of 3% of total premium or 20% of net profit until the reserve reaches the greater of minimum paid up capital or
      50% of net premium for general business. contingency reserve for life business is credited with the higher of 1% of gross
      premiums and 10% of net profit.


      3.23 other reserve

           other reserves are made up of the following:
           revaluation reserve

           revaluation reserve represents the fair value differences on the revaluation of items of property and equipment as
           at the statement of financial position date. if an asset’s carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation,
           the increase is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in revaluation reserve. the increase is
           recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised
           in profit or loss. if an assets carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease is recognised in
           profit or loss, however, the decrease shall be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any credit
           balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset.

           the revaluation surplus in respect of an item of property and equipment is transferred to retained earnings when the
           asset is derecognised. this involves transferring the whole of the surplus when the asset is retired or disposed and
           some of the surplus are transferred to retained earnings to correspond to the asset use by the entity. the amount of
           the surplus transferred is the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and
           the depreciation based on the asset’s original cost. transfers from revaluation reserve to retained earnings are not
           made through profit or loss.

           foreign currency translation reserve

           the nigerian naira is the group’s functional and reporting currency. the assets and liabilities of foreign operations
           are translated to naira at spot exchange rates at the reporting date. the income and expenses of foreign operations are
           translated to naira at spot exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or at average rates of exchange where these
           approximate to actual rates. foreign currency differences on the translation of foreign operations are recognised in
           other comprehensive income and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.


           however, if the foreign operation is not wholly owned the relevant proportion of the translation difference is allocated
           to non-controlling interests. when a foreign operation is disposed of, such that controls is lost, the cumulative amount
           in the foreign currency translation reserve related to that foreign operation is transferred to profit or loss as part of
           the gain or loss in disposal.

           fair value reserve

           the fair value reserve comprises the net cumulative change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the
           investment is derecognised or impaired.

           merger reserve
           merger reserve warehouses the difference between the consideration paid and the capital of the acquiree under a
           common control transaction using the book value accounting method. this was accounted for by the merger of the
           company business with it subsidiary intercontential properties limited (ipl).

     distributions to equity holders.

     (ii) earnings per share
     (a) basic earnings per share

     the group presents basic earnings per share for its ordinary shares. basic earnings per share are calculated by
     dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the group by the number of shares outstanding during
     the year.

     adjusted earnings per share is determined by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
     weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the bonus shares issued.


     (b) diluted earnings per share

     the group presents diluted earnings per share where appropriate. diluted earnings per share is determined by
     adjusting the profit or loss that is attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary
     shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to
     employees.


3.25 underwriting expenses


underwriting expenses are made up of acquisition and maintenance expenses comprising commission and policy expenses,
other direct costs and insurance supervision levy.

underwriting expenses for insurance contracts are recognized as expense when incurred, with the exception of acquisition
costs which are recognized on a time apportionment basis in respect of risk.


3.26 income recognition

     (i) gross premium income

     gross written premiums recognised for assumed insurance risks during the year are amortised over the period of
     the insurance contract. the gross premiums written are recognised as gross premiums income by adjusting for the
     movement in the unearned premiums reserves for insurance risks brought forward from the last year at the beginning
     of the year and the required unearned premiums reserves for the outstanding insurance risks at the end of the year.
     recognised gross premiums income represent the earned portion of all insurance contracts in force during the year
     both from preceding years and the current year.


     (ii) fees and commission income

     fees and commission income are recognised on the commission and policy admin fees received in respect of
     businesses ceded out to reinsurance companies and other insurance companies as set out in note 3.16 (c) (iv), and

     trading of securities including all realised and unrealised fair value changes, interest, dividends and foreign exchange
     differences. investment income, other than interest income, is recognised at fair value and on an accrual basis.

     interest income is recognised in the profit or loss as it accrues and is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
     fees and commissions that form an integral part of the effective yield of a financial instrument are recognised as an
     adjustment to the effective interest rate of the instrument.


                                                                                                                                           131

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




           net realised gain/ (loss) from financial assets:

           net realised gain/ (loss) is the gain/(loss) arising from the disposal of financial assets held at fair value through other
           comprehensive income and are reclassified from other comprehensive income and recognised in the profit or loss.


           net fair value gain/ (loss) from assets at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl):

           net fair value changes arising from the changes in the fair value of financial assets held at fair value through profit or
           loss are recognised in the profit or loss. these are mainly fair value changes from financial assets held for trading or
           designated at fair value through profit or loss and investment properties.


           net fair value gain/ (loss) from assets at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl):

           net fair value changes arising from the changes in the fair value of financial assets held at fair value through profit or
           loss are recognised in the profit or loss. these are mainly fair value changes from financial assets held for trading or
           designated at fair value through profit or loss and investment properties.

           (iv) other operating income

           other operating income comprises of profit from sale of property and equipment, interest income earned on staff
           loans and net foreign exchange gain. interest income is recognised in the profit or loss as it accrues and is calculated
           using the effective interest rate method.

           (v) dividend income

           dividend is recognized when the group’s right to receive the dividend has been established. the right to receive
           dividend is established when the dividend has been duly declared.


      3.27 foreign currency transactions

      foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. monetary
      assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate ruling at the reporting date;
      the resulting foreign exchange gain or loss is recognized in the profit or loss.

      unrealized exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss for financial asset held for trading or designated at fair
      value through profit or loss, or directly in equity through other comprehensive income until the asset is sold or becomes
      impaired for available-for-sale financial assets.


      3.28 employee benefits

           short-term benefits
           short-term employee benefit obligations include wages, salaries and other benefits which the group has a present
           obligation to pay, as a result of employees’ services provided up to the reporting sheet date. the accrual is calculated
           on an undiscounted basis, using current salary rates and recognised in the profit or loss.

           a provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if
           the group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the
           employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

           post employment benefits

           the group operates a defined contributory retirement scheme as stipulated in the pension reform act 2004. under
           the defined contribution scheme, the group pays fixed contributions of 10% to a separate entity – pension fund
           administrators; employees also pay a minimum fixed percentage contribution of 8% to the same entity.


           once the contributions have been paid, the group retains no legal or constructive obligation to pay further
           contributions if the fund does not hold enough assets to finance benefits accruing under the retirement benefit plan.

                                                                                                              annual report & accounts




     the group’s obligations are recognized in the profit or loss.

     termination benefits

     termination benefits are payable whenever an employee’s employment is terminated before the normal retirement
     date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. the group recognizes
     termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed either to terminate the employment of current employees
     according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or to provide termination benefits as a result
     of an offer made to encourage voluntarily redundancy if it is probable that the offer will be accepted and the number
     of acceptances can be estimated. benefits falling due more than 12 months after reporting sheet date are discounted
     to present value.


3.29 management expenses

management expenses are expenses other than claims and underwriting expenses. they include depreciation expenses and
other operating expenses and are accounted for on an accrual basis.


3.30 operating segment

an operating segment is a component of the group engaged in business activities, whose operating results are reviewed
regularly by management in order to make decisions about resources to be allocated to segments and assessing segment
performance. the group’s identification of segments and the measurement of segment results is based on the group’s
internal reporting to management. transactions between segments are priced at market-related rates.


3.31 business combination

business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date i.e.. when control is
transferred to the group. the consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value as are the
identifiable net assets acquired . any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.


any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. transaction costs are expensed as incurred
except if they are related to the issue of debt or equity securities. the consideration transferred does not include amounts
related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. such amounts are generally recognised in accordance with the
relevant ifrs in profit or loss. any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. if
the contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.


3.32 statutory deposit

these deposits represent balances statutorily required by the insurance regulator of the group to be held with the central
bank of nigeria. these deposits are not available for day to day use and are stated at amortised cost.


3.33 contingent liabilities and contingent assets

the group disclose as contingent liabilities possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity’s control; or a present obligation
that arises from past events but is not recognised because, it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation; or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured reliably.


the group classify as contingent assets, possible assets whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the group’s control. where the assets are not probable
– no asset is recognised or disclosed, where the assets are probable, but not virtually certain – no asset is recognised, but
disclosure is included; and where the assets are virtually certain – the asset is recognised in the statement of financial
position. contingent liabilities and contingent assets are grouped by class with brief description of the nature of the
contingency and, where practicable, an estimate of the financial effect, the uncertainties relating to the amount and timing
of the probable liabilities and assets. these normally comprise of legal claims under arbitration or court process in respect
of which a liability or asset is not likely to crystallise.

                                                                                                                                         133

      04. critical accounting estimates and judgments


      management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. the underlying
      judgments of the selection and disclosure of the group’s critical accounting policies and estimates, and the application
      of these policies and estimates are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including
      expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.


      key sources of estimation uncertainty

      i.    determination of fair values
            the determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price requires
            the use of techniques as described in accounting policy 3.2(d). further disclosures on the company’s valuation
            methodology have been made on note 5 (fair value hierarchy) . for financial instruments that trade infrequently
            and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees of judgement depending
            on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific
            instrument.

      ii.   depreciation and carrying value of property and equipment
            the estimation of the useful lives of assets is based on management’s judgement. adjustment to the estimated useful
            lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the carrying value of these items. there were no
            significant sensitivities of the carrying value of property and equipment and the depreciation charge for the year to
            10% increase or decrease in the useful life of property and equipment in the books of the company as at 31 december
            2015 (31 december 2014: nil).

      iii. actuarial valution of insurance contracts liabilities
            the liabilities for life insurance contracts are estimated using appropriate and acceptable base tables of standard
            mortality according to the type and nature of the insurance contracts. assumptions such as expenses inflation, valuation
            interest rate, mortality and claims experience are considered in estimating the required reserves for individual life
            contracts fund and the incurred but not reported claims under the group life contracts. the sensitivities to various
            valuation index is included under note 5 (sensitivity analysis).

      iv. recoverability of deferred tax assets
            deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to
            the extent that in management’s judgements it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which
            they can be used. deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to the extent that it is no longer
            probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

      v.    impairment of available-for-sale financial assets
            at the balance sheet date, the fair values of certain equity securities classified as available-for-sale financial assets with
            a carrying amount of n 972.2 million have declined below cost by n 264.1 million. the group has made a judgement
            that this decline is not significant or prolonged. in making this judgement, the group has considered, among other
            factors, the short-term duration of the decline, the small magnitude by which the fair value of the investment is below
            cost; and the positive financial health and short-term business outlook of the investees.

            if the decline in fair value below cost was considered significant or prolonged, the group would have recognised an
            additional loss of n264.1 million in its 2015 financial statements.

      vi. impairment of fair value through profit or loss financial assets
            at the balance sheet date, the fair values of certain financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or
            loss (fvtpl) with a carrying amount of n 398 million have have appreciated above cost by n 17.9 million. if the
            appreciation in fair value above cost were not considered, the group would have recognised an additional loss of
            n17.9 million in its 2015 financial statements.

      fair value hierarchy

      the group’s accounting policy and basis of fair value measurements are disclosed under notes 3.2(d) and 4. the
      determination of fair value for financial and other assets as well as financial and other liabilities for which there is no
      observable market price requires the use of certain valuation techniques. for financial instruments and other assets and
      liabilities that trades infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying
      degrees of judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other
      risks affecting the specific instrument. the group measures fair value using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects
      the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement.

         level 1
         the fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market price in an active market for
         an identical instrument at the balance sheet date.

         level 2
         the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by using valuation
         techniques based on observable inputs. this category includes instruments valued using quoted market prices in active
         markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or
         other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
         level 3
         this includes financial instruments and other assets and liabilities, the valuation of which incorporates significant inputs
         that is not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). unobservable inputs are those not readily available
         in an active market due to market illiquidity or complexity of the product. these inputs are generally determined based
         on inputs of a similar nature, historic observations on the level of the input or analytical techniques.

      determination of fair value of financial instruments:
      (i) valuation techniques used to derive level 3 fair values
      level 2 and level 3 fair values of investments have been generally derived using the adjusted fair value comparison approach.
      quoted price per earning or price per book value, enterprise value to ebitda ratios of comparable entities in a similar
      industry were obtained and adjusted for key factors to reflect estimated ratios of the investment being valued. adjusting
      factors used are the illiquidity discount which assumes a reduced earning on a private entity in comparison to a publicly
      quoted entity and the haircut adjustment which assumes a reduced earning for an entity located in nigeria contributed by
      lower transaction levels in comparison to an entity in a developed or emerging market. below is a table showing sensitivity
      analysis of material unquoted investments categorised as level 2 fair values.

(ii) determination of fair value of investment property
management employed the services of estate surveyors and valuers expert to value its investment properties. the estimated
open market value is deemed to be the fair value based on the assumptions that there will be willing buyers and sellers.
recent market prices of neighborhood properties were also considered in deriving the open market values. a variation of
-/+5% will result in n33.8 million and n32 million in the group and company results (2014: n202.8 million and n201.1
million).

      insurers to comply with this capital adequacy requirement.

      this test compares insurers’ capital against the risk profile. section 24 (1) of the insurance act, 2003 requires that an
      insurer shall in respect of its business other than its life insurance business, maintain at all times a margin of solvency
      being the excess of the value of its admissible assets in nigeria over its liabilities in nigeria.

      the solvency margin shall not be less than 15 per centum of the gross premium income less reinsurance premiums paid
      out during the year under review or the minimum paid-up capital whichever is greater. during the year, the company has
      consistently exceeded this minimum. the regulator has the authority to request more extensive reporting and can place
      restrictions on the company’s operations if the company falls below this requirement as deemed necessary.

      07. operating segments



         the group is organized into two operating segments as described below, which are the group’s strategic business
         units. these segments distribute their products through various forms of brokers, agencies and direct marketing
         programs. management identifies its reportable operating segments by product line consistent with the reports used
         by the management. these segments and their respective operations are as follows:

         general business:
         this segment covers the protection of customers’ assets (particularly their properties, both for personal and
         commercial business) and indemnification of other parties that have suffered damage as a result of customers’
         accidents. all contracts in this segment are short-term in nature. revenue in this segment is derived primarily from
         insurance premium, investment income, net realized gains on financial assets, and net fair value gains on financial
         assets at fair value through profit or loss.

         life business:
         this segment covers the protection of the group’s customers against the risk of premature death, disability, critical
         illness and other accidents. revenue from this segment is derived primarily from insurance premium, investment
         income and net fair value gains on financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.

         expenses for corporate units that render services for all business segments are initially paid by the general business
         segment and transferred to other business units at cost price. the expenses are allocated based on service man hours
         rendered by the corporate units to the various business segments.

         the corporate expenses for the following centrally shared services are being apportioned to all business segments in
         the group:

iv) the investment in the coronation merchant bank limited (cmbl) was reclassified to investment in associate following
an additional acquisition of equity shareholding in january 2015 which increased the holding of the company to 23.74%.

the company acquired additional 450,338,194 units of cmbl shares for n1.7 billion which brought its equity holdings in
the investee to 1,151,522,568 units representing 23.74% of the issued and fully paid ordinary shares of the investee.

the entire equity holding in cmbl was therefore revalued to the fair value (n4.36 billion) at the acqusition date and
appropriately reclassified to investment in associate and the company accounted for this investment using the equity
accounting method.

5.1. receiving complaints
complaints may be received in person, over the telephone or in writing. staff at all levels must accept complaints and know
what action they can take to resolve them.

with complaints received verbally staff should:

  •   give a calm explanation of what happened if they do know why it happened.

  •   offer an apology if warranted.

  •   encourage the complainant to discuss their concerns with the relevant staff.

  •   speak to the relevant staff on behalf of the complainant.

  •   advise the complainant of the complaint management process.

  •   know when to refer the complaint on.

  •   comprehensively record the conversation and concerns, along with all necessary details (names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.)

  •   if possible, provide a copy of the completed record to the complainant to ensure they agree that it is factually correct.

  •   advise them of the appropriately identified person if they wish to send any written correspondence.

  •   commence actioning the complaint if possible.


5.2. registering and acknowledging complaints
as soon as a complaint is received:

  •   it must be registered via the complaint notification form. if it involves a claim, a copy of the claims document must be attached
      with the complaint.

  •   acknowledge its receipt within 48 hours. acknowledgement may be by mail or in writing. complaints received by email shall be
      acknowledged within 48 hours. complaints received by post shall be acknowledged in writing.

  •   written acknowledgements should:

      explain the complaints process

      identify contact person/details for the complainant

      expected timeframes and what might be requested from the complainant

  •   assess the complaint and assign it to the relevant person to co-ordinate its management


5.3. initial assessment
the purpose of the assessment process is to:

  •   classify the complaint appropriately to determine appropriate action

  •   ensure the process is commensurate to the seriousness of the complaint and the issues raised

  •   ensure fairness to any staff concerned.

there are several steps a staff must take in assessing a complaint:


identify the issues raised
  •   identify the issues for resolution, which includes the key concerns raised by the complainant, as well as any other issues that arise
      or are identified by the staff.

  •   if any or all of the issues are unclear, before progressing the matter, clarify them with the complainant




                                                                                                                                                    207

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




      identifying the parties involved.
        •   the relevant parties are those key people involved with the complaint plus those involved with the incident that is the subject of the
            complaint. they may not always be a respondent to the complaint, but may be key people in the provision of service under inquiry.


      5.4. investigate the complaint

      information collection
      all complaints require to a greater or lesser degree a fact-finding process in order to determine what has happened and
      what course of action is required in response. consideration is required to determine:

        •   what information to obtain

        •   where it is to be obtained

        •   how it should best be collected (interview, site inspection, phone call, email),and

        •   how it is communicated (report, statement)


      the company secretary would:

        •   consider who may be appropriate to provide expert advice/review.

        •   consider whether information is needed from external agencies or from other areas within the company.

        •   consider whether information needs to be secured.

        •   construct a chronology of events, or flow chart, particularly if the matter is complex.

        •   identify who may be interviewed and the appropriate order of interviews.

        •   consider if an interpreter is required.

        •   consider whether an on-site investigation is appropriate.

        •   develop questions for the key parties based on the analysis of the issues and information required.

        •   determine the applicable standards/procedures/policies and whether they were adhered to.


      analysis and review
        •   as information is collected, it must be analyzed and reviewed. analysis includes identifying:

        •   what can be agreed upon between the parties.

        •   what facts are in dispute.

        •   is information provided relevant and reliable.

        •   sufficient information has been gathered to determine whether particular standards have been met.

        •   whether there are inconsistencies.

        •   whether independent verification has been obtained.

        •   what systemic and performance factors led to the outcome.



      5.5. respond
      once the information has been analyzed, the person managing the complaint makes findings and recommendations for
      action. actions taken by a wapic staff to resolve a complaint must be based on the evidence, address any system, process
      or practitioner issues, and are informed by the principles of public interest.




208

                                                                                                                       annual report & accounts




options for appropriate action may include:

  •   offering an apology

  •   waiving fees

  •   develop or amend policy/procedure training/education of staff or public

  •   modification of the environment

  •   requesting a formal review

  •   ongoing monitoring of an issue, or

  •   no action recommended

the wapic staff must ensure that the outcome and recommendations are clearly communicated to the consumer, staff,
and management, and integrated into quality improvement systems through appropriate implementation and subsequent
review of effectiveness.


5.6. complaint resolution - final response
the target for finalizing complaints is 10 calendar days. final responses will be in the form of a letter from the chief
executive or their delegate. the final response must be factually correct and:

  •   include an apology. nb: this is not necessarily about accepting blame or fault, but will sometimes be an acknowledgement of the
      complainant’s experience and their feelings.

  •   address each of the points the complainant has raised with a full explanation or give the reason(s) why it is not possible to comment
      on a specific matter.

  •   give specific details about the investigation, i.e. sources of information, what was discovered, etc.

  •   give details of action taken as a result of the complaint.

  •   provide the name and telephone number of the investigating officer for further queries/discussion.

  •   offer to meet the complainant with the key staff involved. if there is a reason why a specific issue cannot be addressed this should
      be stated.

  •   include details of further action available to the complainant.


as much as possible, the complaint manager should ensure that department heads and staff members who have been
involved are given the opportunity to see the final response before it is sent for final signature.

the final response will be:

  •   sent to the complainant and include a copy of the companies complaint management policy.

  •   copied to the relevant manager.

  •   copied to any requesting parties to which the patient has given consent e.g. solicitor

  •   copies to the corporate record system record.


where the complaint is not resolved within the stipulated time frame, the complaint would be forwarded to the securities
and exchange commission within two calendar days. the delegated officer will deal with the points raised within the
complaint and ensure it is forwarded to sec.

timeframes for answering further correspondence will be as those for the first response.




                                                                                                                                                  209

 wapic insurance plc annual report & accounts 2015




      6. framework for complaint management
      framework for complaint management

      complaints can be managed:

        •   at point of service

        •   through a staged process

        •   through referral to an external body/agency


      6.1. point of service complaints
      ideally, most complaints will be dealt with directly and quickly at the point where the problem arises. escalation of
      complaints may be avoided where staff have clear authorization to resolve complaints at first contact. often, no changes to
      procedures are required as many complaints involve an acknowledgement of the complainant’s perspective, an explanation
      of events and validation of the complainant’s satisfaction with the explanation.

      complaints should be referred to a line manager if they:

        •   remain unresolved,

        •   involve serious consequences,

        •   involve complex medical issues or a number of different staff,

        •   need action that is beyond the responsibility of the staff at point of service,

        •   require escalation or reporting to an external body under the securities and exchange commission’s rules relating to complaints
            management


      6.2. escalation process
      complaints are referred to the next level of management when the matter is outside delegation or is unresolved.

      the escalation process proceeds as follows:

        •   immediate line manager.

        •   facility manager and/or patient liaison officer as appropriate.

        •   senior complaints officer.

      in cases where the complainant does not feel comfortable in making a complaint to those directly delivering the service,
      the appropriate line manager should be sought to speak to the complainant. if the complainant will not speak with a line
      manager, they must be offered alternative ways to make their complaint, such as to the company secretary. the recipient
      of the complaint must then inform the complainant of the course of action that will be taken next.

      complaints should be dealt with by the unit involved where possible, with support from a complaints manager. however,
      for more serious matters or those with broader implications for the company, senior management and the executive must
      be notified and participate in the resolution.

      depending on the type of complaint, it may be necessary to alert the securities and exchange commission or obtain legal
      advice. this should not interfere with the aim of resolving the complaint quickly and amicably.


      7. complaint handling consideration

      7.1. anonymous complaints
      anonymous callers should be advised that an investigation is made more problematic if they do not divulge identities as
      this severely limits the service’s ability to obtain information.




210

                                                                                                                      annual report & accounts




they should then be informed of confidentiality, as applied to the complaint management process, to encourage them to
reveal their own and/or the subject’s identity.

the complainant needs to be informed:

  •   there will be disclosure of information to any respondents identified;

  •   there is “nothing off the record” in information provided to the service;

  •   what will happen with the information given to the service.

however, the complainant’s wishes should be respected, as an assurance of absolute confidentiality cannot be given.
anonymous written complaints may reveal the identity of the complainant or it may be apparent from the complaint
details. an inquiry may still be possible and may be warranted if the complaint raises public health and safety concerns or
where external agencies may need to be notified.


7.2. declining to deal with a complaint
the company may decide to decline to deal with a complaint because it is:

  •   vexatious or frivolous,

  •   the subject matter of the complaint (or part) has been or is under investigation by some other competent person or body or has been
      or is the subject of legal proceedings.

  •   complaints on matters that are sub-judice or in arbitration.

  •   complaints falling outside the purview of the securities and exchange commission

  •   care needs to be taken in assessing these complaints to ensure that every effort is made to understand the information the
      complainant is attempting to convey.


if a complaint has been declined, complainants should be advised of the reasons for the decision as well other agencies that
may be able to assist them with their concerns.


7.3. unresolved complaints
if a complainant remains dissatisfied following the service’s response, they have several options available to them, which
may include:

  •   review by another senior member of staff or the company secretary

  •   independent review by external agency/person

  •   referral to the securities and exchange commission 2 working days after the ten days’ time frame


complainants have the right to pursue their complaint until it is resolved to their satisfaction. however, there are reasonable
limits in terms of dealing with continued contact and correspondence with dissatisfied complainants and matters that
might be frivolous or vexatious complaints.


8. complaint register
the company shall maintain an electronic complaints register that would be updated monthly. the complaints register,
shall contain the following details:

  •   name of the complainant

  •   date of the complaint

  •   nature of complaint

  •   complaints details in brief

  •   remarks/comment




                                                                                                                                                 211
