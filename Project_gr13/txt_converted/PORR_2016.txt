corporate social responsibility (csr)

social, ethical and ecological measures are in-
corporated into every decision-making process
at porr at every stage and subjected to regular
monitoring. in order to do justice to its responsibil-
ity towards staff, owners, investors and other in-
terest groups, porr has introduced an integrated
management system (ims) in every business unit
and subsidiary; the ims is constantly upgraded
and adjusted to the requirements of the interest

                   customer orientation is the top priority in the
                   porr corporate policy and is recorded in the
                   management system as a standardised process –
                   including with internal and external audits for
                   quality assurance and iso certification. in the
                   course of the materiality analysis, the aspect of
                   customer satisfaction was also identified as a
                   central issue. the management handbook refer-
                   ences the specific motto “know your customers”
                   under the item corporate policy. the management
                   handbook demonstrates in a structured way the
                   issues that should be addressed when dealing
                   with clients – particularly those for the hand­
                   over of projects, during the ongoing develop­ment
                   phase and during the final meeting. the project
                   manager records the subjective impressions by
                   means of a memory log – in germany this is also
                   complemented by a special record of the final
                   meeting.

                   furthermore, the management handbook pro-
                   motes a proactive approach to clients in order
                   to determine customer satisfaction – whereby
                   personal talks are given preference over stand-
                   ardised questionnaires. this process begins right
                   from the tender negotiations and includes archi-
                   tects serving as consultants to the client. the col-
                   laborative discussion atmosphere is guaranteed,
                   especially through adherence to deadlines and
                   budgets.

                   the positive feedback received from customers
                   in the porr brand survey, carried out in 2015,
                   impressively underlined the strong focus on cus-
                   tomer service. porr‘s clients rely on long-stand-
                   ing business relationships with the company.
                   they view porr as a reliable partner with experi-
                   ence and in-depth know-how and appreciate the
                   professional project coordination and execution,
            03     as well as the good work done in public relations.

          at the same time, it is possible that – as a result of
          climate change – risks occur because of new laws
          and regulations, such as the increase in mineral
          oil tax or introducing a new climate tax on fuel and
          electricity. this would lead to an ­increase in en-
          ergy expenses, and thereby projects, that cannot
          yet be quantified. porr proactively counters all
          of the risks that result from climate change in the
          course of projects with a group-wide risk man-
          agement system. a project’s risks are identified
     05   and evaluated right from the calculation phase.

porr is committed to ongoing human
resource development in order to nur-
ture its most important resource. here
it focuses on strengthening individual
competencies.


porr experience renewed growth in the reporting
period 2014/2015. as a result of takeovers and the
expansion of its business activities – both with re-
gard to projects and markets – the company now
has around 15,000 staff members group-wide, of
which around 11,800 are on the home markets.
they are the central driver of porr’s success –
team ­spirit is encouraged across every area of the
group. thanks to constructive cooperation by every
division, porr is able to deliver top performance. in
order to maintain and expand the strong thirst for
innovation and competitive advantages, the com-
pany is committed to continuous further education
and training – in line with the principle of “life-long
learning”. key focal points include nurturing talent
and the in-depth education of tomorrow’s special-
ists. investments in this area have paid off and are
reflected in the long period that employees remain
with the company. while 647 people left the com-
pany in 2014, there were only 675 leavers in 2015,
despite the significant increase in the workforce.
in the period under review people from more than
40 nations were working at porr. targeted meas-
ures led to an increase in the share accounted for
by women from 11.7% in 2014 to 12.5% in 2015.

the responsible approach to ecological
resources and the clear commitment
to environmental protection are an
important pillar of porr’s sustainability
strategy.


one focal point of sustainability management at
porr lies in increasing energy efficiency – a sig-
nificant factor in the construction industry with
regard to costs and competitiveness. at the same
time, the company strives to optimise the use of
resources by recycling building rubble, reducing
waste and improving material usage, developing
new construction materials and building meth-
ods, as well as more efficient construction site
logistics.

environmental management system
the operational environmental management
system is certified to en iso 14001 and has been
­implemented in the integrated management sys-
 tem (ims). the goal of the system is to develop
 and implement a group-wide environmental pol-
 icy with appropriate targets under consideration
 of the legal stipulations. the negative impacts of
 business activities on the environment – particu-
 larly the precious resources of people, air, water
 and soil – should be recognised early on and
 thereby mitigated as far as possible. this ensures
 that ecological aspects are incorporated into
 every relevant process and corporate decision.
 the system, implemented in 2007, was updated
 in 2015 and allows the monitoring of environ-
 mental services and the systematic surveying of
 the respective environmental indicators. porr’s
