oishi:
i’m viewing company initiatives from the perspective
of consumers, and i feel that the retail industry plays
the largest role in educating consumers as to why csr
activities are important and why they are being carried
out. consumers shop at stores on a daily basis. if aeon can
convey social issues and its initiatives simply and concisely,
so as to help consumers select certain products, it can
change consumption patterns and change lifestyles. this is
the kind of huge potential the retail industry has.
sueyoshi:
every day, millions of consumers are buying millions
of things. when it come to food, for example, it is very
important to inform consumers about today’s problems
facing the earth, which provides us with sustenance

     key issue 1


     realization of a low-carbon society
     management approach

     recognition of challenges
     global warming, which is causing the temperature of oceans to rise and airborne temperatures around the world to increase, is having
     serious consequences on our environment, including ecosystem change, coastal erosion caused by rising water levels, and abnormal
     weather. the cause of global warming is greenhouse gases and among them carbon dioxide (co2) accounts for a major share. aeon
     operates 18,740 stores in 13 countries around the world and uses a large amount of energy. for this reason, we are working through
     various activities with the realization of a low-carbon society with fewer co2 emissions set as one of our key issues.

     aeon’s approach
     the largest source of co2 emissions from aeon’s business activities is store operations. therefore, aeon is devoting efforts to reducing
     its co2 footprint by curbing energy usage with the use of more efficient air conditioners, lighting, and refrigerator/freezer cases.
     currently, the entire aeon group is carrying out the aeon eco project (established in september 2012) in order to reach its energy
     saving and energy generating targets set for fy2020.
     • energy saving strategy: reduce energy usage 50% compared to fy2010 by rolling out next-generation eco stores called smart aeon,
        establishing the energy advisor system, and striving to improve the ability of stores to manage their energy usage.
     • energy generation strategy: create renewable energy in the amount of 200,000 kw of output (using mainly solar power systems) by
        fy2020 by installing solar power systems onsite at stores.
          we are also working on the visualization of co2 emission amounts and using joint shipping with other companies in an effort to
     decrease co2 emission during the distribution phase.

     future initiatives
     in july 2015, the government of japan finalized a goal to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26% compared to fy2013 by the
     year 2030. to contribute to reaching this goal, aeon will continue to engage in the aeon eco project and will begin sharing its energy
     management expertise developed in japan at its subsidiaries in china and asean.




           aeon eco project

           in the form of our aeon eco project, aeon set, in september 2012, environmental targets for                                                              aeon
           fy2020, and is carrying out various initiatives to achieve those targets. with current
           increasing needs for energy use efficiency and power conservation, and with the experience                                                              project
           of the great east japan earthquake, aeon has added perspectives of reducing energy use
           and developing renewable energy to environmental protection and has additionally taken
           on a clear role as a lifeline center protecting the community in disasters and emergencies.                                     reduction             generation               protection

based refrigerators and freezers at 28 stores, including our
aeon makuhari new city store, maxvalu supermarkets, and
ministop convenience stores. we are planning to switch to the
natural refrigerant in 3,500 existing stores on a gradual basis.
    aeon faces certain issues ahead of the introduction of
natural refrigerants, including the lack of manufacturers and
high installation costs. we will do our utmost to overcome
these issues and promote the industry-wide use of natural
refrigerants by leveraging performance data accumulated
to date to raise awareness going forward and build ties with
companies within the same industry and other industries.
*1 global warming potential (gwp): a factor expressing a substance’s relative impact on
   global warming. if co2’s value is standardized to 1, gwp values for alternative cfcs
   used in refrigerators and freezers may reach several thousands.

     conservation of biodiversity
     management approach

     recognition of challenges
     all companies harness ecosystem services, leveraging the resources produced by our ecosystem in each phase of the lifecycle, from
     the sourcing of raw materials to production, sales, use and disposal. at the same time, however, the world continues to lose its tropical
     forests while the number of fauna and flora found on the red list of endangered species continues to grow unabated. also, aeon’s
     business operations cannot be sustained without the ecosystem services of agricultural produce and marine products, which is why
     aeon continues to work on various initiatives for the sustainable use of resources, with biodiversity conservation considered one of the
     key issues.

     aeon’s approach
     in march 2010, aeon established the aeon biodiversity principle in order to continually promote the sustainable use of resources while
     conserving biodiversity. following the action guidelines stipulated for this principle, aeon is working together with customers through
     its products and stores.
     • initiatives for products: we have been working to source and sell products that are mindful of ecosystem sustainability, such as
        offering msc certified products (from 2006) and selling notepads made from fsc certified paper (from 2008). in order to further
        reinforce these activities, in february 2014 we devised the aeon sustainable procurement principle and the aeon sustainable seafood
        procurement policy for the sourcing of sustainable sources of marine produce.
     • initiatives at stores: biodiversity has been incorporated into the standards for smart aeon next-generation eco stores and aeon is
        expanding its use of fsc certified wood products as construction materials for ministop stores. these efforts form our commitment to
        create stores that have a minimum impact on the ecosystem as well as the surrounding environment.
          the aeon hometown forests program, launched as an activity to share the importance of nature and world peace with members
     of the local community, has continued for more than two decades since 1991. under this initiative, whenever we open a new store, we
     plant trees on the site of the store together with customers. thus far, we have planted more than 10 million trees and we are working
     on activities under the themes, “plant”, “nurture”, and “thrive”, aimed at the next 10 million trees.

     future initiatives
     environmental agencies and the conference of parties (cop) under the convention on biological diversity are working to make
     biodiversity mainstream through various social and economic activities promoting the protection of biodiversity and its sustainable
     use, from a worldwide to local community. consequently, aeon will utilize its business characteristic of coming into contact with
     vast numbers of consumers on a daily basis to continually highlight the importance of biodiversity through the familiar platforms of
     stores and products. as part of this, in fy2015 aeon steadily expanded its lineup of topvalu gurinal products and is now working on
     devising a procurement policy for forest resources following the aeon sustainable seafood procurement policy.

     key issue 3


     better use of resources
     management approach

     recognition of challenges
     the world’s population continues to grow. many believe it will increase from the current 7 billion to 9 billion by the year 2050.
     meanwhile, the issues of hunger and poverty continue to plague developing countries. the only way to improve the living standards
     of people around the world in a sustainable manner is to make sure that the earth’s limited resources are used effectively and
     responsibly. aeon generates food waste through its business and is also tied to waste produced by customers after the use of plastic
     bags and food containers. this is why we are working on various activities for the better use of resources as one of our key issues.

     aeon’s approach
     aeon launched the bring your own shopping bag campaign back in 1991 and has changed the specifications and formats of
     packaging materials as part of its ongoing efforts aimed at the responsible use of resources. in 2000, the bring your own shopping bag
     campaign developed into the my basket campaign where customer bring their own shopping basket and in 2007 aeon was the first
     nationwide retailer to eliminate free plastic bags at the register, illustrating its many pioneering initiatives over the years. as a result of
     these initiatives, as of february 28, 2015 some 67.5% of aeon customers decline plastic shopping bags, greatly exceeding the industry-
     wide average of 51.3% (as of march 2015). aeon established a goal to achieve zero waste (reduction of landfill waste to zero) at its
     stores by fy2020, given the rising demand in society to reduce waste, and began stepping up its initiatives. food waste, a growing
     social issue, has also been established as a priority kpi.

     future initiatives
     the reduction of garbage and food waste was included as a goal within the sustainable development goals report issued by the
     united nations in 2014. additionally, japan is set to tighten related regulations as well, including the food recycling law and waste
     management and public cleansing act. given this rising demand from society, the aeon group will consolidate the individual activities
     of its companies and regions during fy2015 and establish a common aeon group infrastructure after organizing the basic approach,
     case studies and indicators of these activities. starting in fy2016, aeon’s subsidiaries will begin to set individual targets and carry out
     efforts to achieve them.

                        most of the rubbish discharged from the home is made up
                        of packaging and containers. it is therefore an important
                        responsibility of the retail industry to sell products used in
                        everyday life that contribute to less rubbish by minimizing
                        them.

       * electronic manifest: a management form, issued when industrial waste is generated,
          that confirms that treatment has been carefully carried out. previously, a ledger was
          used for this, which changed hands between the generator of the waste and the
          waste treatment company. recently, however, information on these forms has been
          digitized and an electronic manifest has become common, with digital networks
          carrying the data.

     key issue 4


     addressing social issues
     management approach

     recognition of challenges
     as more and more companies have multinational operations, the extent to which a company affects its stakeholders and society
     continues to grow, whiles impacts continue to increase. amidst this, companies need to fulfill their responsibilities to society
     throughout the supply chain while facing off against myriad social issues, such as human rights, compliance, quality and labor
     practices. aeon, is working on via various activities to help resolve social issues through dialogue held with its diverse stakeholders.

     aeon’s approach
     aeon engages in primarily four activities as key pillars of its efforts to address social issues.
     • community involvement
     aeon gives back to local communities by improving community economic conditions and welfare through its business operations and
     contributing to a safer society. and aeon is also providing myriad programs for supporting the growth of our youth at each life stage,
     from infants up to university students.
     aeon continues to support the reconstruction of the tohoku region following the great east japan earthquake. the project aeon
     joining hands, established between labor and management in 2012, encourages tree planting and volunteer work in the disaster-
     affected areas as well as support in the form of new store openings in the region and sales promotion campaigns involving products
     made in tohoku. starting in fy2015, earthquake reconstruction assistance has been added to our kpi and targets set out to fy2021.
     • fair operating practices
     under the aeon supplier coc (code of conduct) established in 2003, aeon is working with its suppliers in japan and other countries in
     order to build a sustainable supply chain.
     • consumer issues
     with customer safety and reliability a top priority, aeon stands thoroughly committed to quality control of topvalu products and
     working on store designs that are safe and comfortable for customers. the aeon eco project represents one of these measures
     and under the protection strategy we have set a target to create 100 disaster-prevention facilities in our stores nationwide by 2020
     so that they can serve as a lifeline for the community. these next-generation stores known as “smart aeon” will feature their own
     cogeneration facilities to prepare for power outages and water service stoppages during a disaster.
     • human rights/labor practices
     aeon is working to appoint more female managers and hire more people with disabilities as part of its efforts to promote diversity in
     the workplace. we are also actively providing opportunities for our japanese and non-japanese employees to interact and network
     with one another. aeon is committed to building workplaces that are environmentally friendly and that incorporate work-life balance
     initiatives so that employees can fulfill both their work and childcare needs.

     future initiatives
     aeon plans on proactively expanding its business operations in japan, china and asean in the fields of retail, finance, real estate
     development, and services. the needs and expectations of stakeholders vary based on the business and region, so aeon will seek
     to become a responsible retailer essential to the local community by identifying important issues and goals through dialogue with
     stakeholders.

            customers a selection of local favorites that include familiar
            items, freshly harvested produce and seasonal seafood

     to a 10-year plan of activities, running from fy2012 to fy2021.
     given the need for a medium- to long-term strategy as we progress with these activities, we have defined our “medium-
     to long-term plan,” which divides activities as a whole into three-year cycles, and will run until fy2021.

      update report              aeon’s response to the great east japan earthquake:providing support through our business activities




     aeon continues its initiatives aimed at reconstructing and developing the tohoku
     region by assisting in the development of towns conducive to secure living
     and the vitalization of the region’s agricultural, fishery and livestock industries.
     since the great east japan earthquake occurred, aeon has assisted the local people in their daily living and dedicated
     itself to reopening stores in disaster-affected areas that potentially serve as those areas’ economic infrastructure,
     including how the stores employ local people.
     yet, in municipalities that suffered tremendous damage, towns are in need of large-scale reconstruction that goes beyond
     reopening individual stores to include the redevelopment of peripheral infrastructure. given that situation, aeon has
     been striving to create employment by opening stores in the tohoku area and providing goods and services that are
     convenient and help to enrich lifestyles.


     contributing to communities through our stores
     in march 2013, aeon concluded the “agreement regarding
     installment of a large-scale commercial facility and contribution to                                                              aizu festival held with
                                                                                                                                       aizuwakamatsu city
     the local community” with kamaishi city in iwate prefecture which
     is working hard toward reconstruction. together with the city, aeon
     opened aeon town kamaishi in march 2014 to create a city that
     takes disaster prevention and evacuation systems into consideration.
     towards the realization of safe and prosperous living, aeon opened
     15 stores in the six prefectures of the tohoku region during fy2014.
     we are also working together with government and regional
                                                                                          aeon town kamaishi

     culture that is local to tohoku.


     supporting through products
     aeon is supporting reconstruction and revitalization of tohoku
     agriculture, fishing and livestock industries mainly through topvalu
     product lines and other products containing tohoku ingredients
     with a “reach! the hearts of tohoku" logo sticker and selling these
     items throughout japan. additionally, in cooperation with sanriku
     tetsudo railway and the kuji city fishery cooperative in iwate
     prefecture, we developed japan’s first “fast fish*” product. we
     initiated sales of that product in 2012, and have since been
     successively increasing our jointly developed product portfolio.
     * fish food that has been processed so that it can be casually but tastily enjoyed
       without taking time to prepare.




     promoting support efforts together with our customers all over japan
     in order to serve as a bridge that connects disaster victims and our                      to foundations that support the “lives” and “education” of children in
     customers, we continue to engage in support efforts together with                         the prefectures of iwate, miyagi and fukushima, making for
     those customers to leverage aeon’s unique infrastructure and                              cumulative donations of 5,500,080,373 yen by aeon (out of which
     initiatives. in fy2015, we donated a total of approx. 99,370,000 yen                      1,450 million yen originated from our customers).
