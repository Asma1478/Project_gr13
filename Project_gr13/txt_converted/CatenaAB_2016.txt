                    a leading market position.
                    since the inception of the modern catena, the company has been a leader in
                    logistics properties. following the acquisition of tribona that has been initiat-
                    ed, catena will be the largest real estate company in logistics in sweden with
                    more than 90 properties and a combined property area of more than 1,500,000
                    square metres. this will provide catena with cost and revenue synergies
                    and will broaden catena’s customer portfolio. among other things, this
                    strengthens the company’s position in food which is a prioritised sector.

                                      that catena’s business model works well.
                                      in recent years, catena has been able to report continuously improved profit
                                      from property management, which consists of the company’s cash flow
                                      from operations. this corresponds to about half of catena’s rental revenue.

    catena continued to grow
    efficient and expanding property management generated favourable cash flow
    over the year. the divestment of the ”haga norra” project properties stream-
    lined the operations and further strengthened catena’s financial position. this
    allowed the acquisition of a number of attractive logistics properties and the
    bid for tribona, which was completed in january 2016. moving forward, this
    also permits continued expansion, particularly through project development.

side stockholm, were divested, with catena relinquishing
possession on 23 june. the sale generated a pre-tax gain
in 2015 for catena of about sek 100 million after trans-
action costs. on the whole, the divestment strengthens the
balance sheet and provides a liquidity contribution over
time of nearly sek 1 billion, providing a good foundation
for catena’s continued expansion in logistics properties.

the challenge lies mainly in gaining access to the right
locations for the specific task. as a community builder,
we maintain frequent contacts with municipalities and
other parties to safeguard society’s cargo flows efficiently
in terms of cost and the environment. for the benefit our
community, customers, shareholders and all other stake-
holders, to thereby be able to develop attractive logistics
facilities along the country’s transport routes and around
city centres, close to final consumers who increasingly
rely on e-commerce. we have good human and financial
resources to be able to achieve that.
    from cargo flows, we can generate cash flow allowing
us to build new types of logistics positions and to estab-
lish catena as scandinavia’s leading property company
in the logistics sector. an exciting challenge that we at
catena are well equipped to meet.

8 logistics  trends
  annual report 2015 | catena ab




       three trends –
       smarter, better and faster
       the trend for smarter, better and faster logistics is driven by the requirements
       of industry and commerce. industry seeks to reduce its inventory to reduce
       costs and working capital. more expensive city-centre locations mean that
       centrally located shops are reducing their storage capacity. combined with
       rapidly growing e-commerce, this demands smaller, more frequent, cost-
       efficient, environmentally friendly deliveries, which in turn imposes fresh
       requirements on new, customised logistics premises.

the company completed, among other things, a terminal for dhl at the

it co-owns with peab. the 16,940 square-metre property has 85 doors,

 construction of a 10,000 square-metre terminal to handle

the ceo comments on the
year’s sustainability work
with regard to catena’s sustainability efforts, 2015 was an eventful year.
we have continued to work with the sustainability targets that we set out
within the framework of the business plan that applies until 2020. in 2015,
we focused primarily on improving energy efficiency in our properties and
on ongoing work with sustainable logistics and societal development.
during the year, we have recruited an energy and tech-
nology developer to work exclusively with saving energy.
we have also implemented an energy monitoring system
that allows for more methodical monitoring and analysis.
at the same time, practical energy efficiency efforts out
among our properties continued to produce good results.
    in efforts on sustainable logistics and societal devel-
opment, we have been active in meeting local government
leaders in various places around sweden. the aim is to
establish a dialogue on logistics issues and to ensure that
these matters become a part of community planning, par-
ticularly when planning new residential areas. here, we
notice that catena contributes a perspective that has partly
been lacking in these discussions.
    in the metropolitan areas, the predominant topic of
discussion is city logistics or “urban logistics”. in other
municipalities where catena operates, we are mainly dis-
cussing long-distance cargo and how we can together make
these municipalities more attractive hubs for logistics.
    we are continuing the process of building an organisa-
tion that interacts closely with the operations. from hav-
ing been centred around helsingborg, we now also have
two well-functioning regional offices in gothenburg and
nyköping. during the year, we increased our personnel
by five people, strengthening the organisation in business
development, administration and management. at the
same time, this has led to a rejuvenation of the company
and more women in management.
    as we now look forward to 2016, i believe the year
will be pervaded by efforts to integrate the properties and
new employees brought in with the addition of tribona
ab. we are also looking forward to continued expansion,
both through new construction and acquisitions of exist-
ing properties in the right locations.

   the right location reduced dhl’s carbon emissions
   in early 2016, dhl moved into a new terminal in sunnanå outside
   malmö. this made them the first tenant at the catena’s logistikpo-
   sition malmö. in connection with its move to sunnanå, dhl vacated
   its former terminal in central malmö – entailing major environmen-
   tal gains with the amount of long distance cargo traversing central
   malmö being greatly reduced.

   it is very important to us that we locate our freight terminals as
   close as possible to ring roads and major thoroughfares. this
   particular change has resulted in a saving of 400 tonnes of co2e
   per year, of which 350 tonnes derives from reduced transport and
   the remainder from new property technologies, says per karjer vice
   president corporate real estate at dhl nordic ab.

   dhl’s move to logistikposition malmö is a typical example of how
   logistics properties in the right location can reduce the environmen-
   tal impact of transports. besides the strategic location, catena and
   dhl have worked together to reduce the energy consumption and
   environmental impact of the terminal building.

   we have focused greatly on smart lighting control and invested in
   geothermal heating. the property is also environmentally certified in
   accordance with the green building standard. throughout, catena
   has been a professional partner and a keen listener. an additional
   step was taken by preparing for a photovoltaic installation on the
   roof, per karjer concludes.

   catena owns the area in sunnanå jointly with peab. it covers a total
   270,000 square metres of developable land.

profit was also affected by changes in the value of deriva-
tives, which increased from a negative sek 150.6 million
to a positive sek 30.5 million, mainly due to long-term
market interest rates having risen during the year.
    the unrealised changes in value are of an accounting
nature and do not affect the existing cash flow.

metres. catena also holds building rights for a
further 17,000 square metres on the property.
     the existing building is a centrally and strategi-

with no surrounding homes that could conceivably
be disrupted by frequent, 24-hour activities.

          accordingly, the property is

the 2015 year of operations was characterised by strong growth. in addition
to acquisitions of a number of properties, in the autumn, we were able to sub-
mit a bid for tribona, which was completed in early 2016. this pervaded the
work of the board over the year. alongside the valuation and financial issues
associated with growing operations, the work of the board also became more
future-oriented, focusing increasingly on balancing opportunities and risks
responsibly. to maintain the confidence of stakeholders, we have developed
and adapted our corporate governance for an expanded organisation.
