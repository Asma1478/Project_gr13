    foreword   dear readers,
               we cannot simply be satisfied with our past success.
               nevertheless, this success gives us a strong basis for
               coping with the changes in the aviation industry and
               for developing fraport profitably in the future. our
               mission is to be europe’s best airport operator, set
               standards worldwide and to focus on the needs of our
               customers while doing so. we have summarized this in
               a single sentence in our new mission statement: “gute
               reise! we make it happen”. this places our customers
               even more strongly at the center of our activities than
               before. at the same time we will continue to develop
               our strategic direction in response to the changing
               environment and market conditions to ensure that
               fraport is positioned for success in the aviation market
               over the long term.

               this represents a 65 percent decrease compared to
               emissions in base year 1990. co2 emissions are to be
               reduced to 0.9 kg co2 per traffic unit (one passenger
               or 100 kg of cargo or mail). this would correspond to
               a reduction of 84 percent.

    frankfurt airport turns 80

    on july 8, 1936, frankfurt airport was inau-
    gurated at its current location with the first
    landing of a “junkers ju 52/3m”. as early as
    1937, the airport had almost 71,000 passen-
    gers. in world war ii, the airport was struck
    by approximately 2,000 bombs, which led
    to its almost complete destruction. after
    the airport was repaired and when regular
    passenger traffic resumed in 1950, the number
    of passengers grew steadily. ten years later,
    the airport already had 2.2 million passen-
    gers, and in 1980 served 17.7 million air
    travelers. within another 10 years, this figure
    doubled to almost 30 million passengers. in
    2016, frankfurt counted a total of just under
    61 million passengers.

                    enhancement
               we consider “economic enhancement” to mean the continuous
               increase of our company’s value and the safeguarding and improve-
               ment of profitability while maintaining a financial balance. the goal
               of economic enhancement is to achieve profitable growth and the
               long-term generation of a positive value added in all business segments.
               as such, we manage the group’s development according to the prin-
               ciples of value management. the key figure for this is the fraport
               value added. 1) we use retained profits as the basis for future capital
               expenditure and to further increase the company’s value.




               1)
                    fraport value added means the difference between ebit and capital costs
                    (= fraport assets × cost of capital). as of the beginning of fiscal year 2015, pre-tax results
                    and the carrying amounts of group-companies accounted for using the equity method have
                    been added to ebit and fraport assets. in this way, fraport takes account of both consolidated
                    companies and companies accounted for using the equity method in value management.

the weather station on the airport apron. we
are responsible for ensuring that all lights
work. if one is defective, we immediately go
out and repair it, but that is the exception.
our regular, strictly controlled maintenance
procedures virtually eliminates such failures.”

in addition to these safety-related systems,
girousis and his team also service all the
clocks in the two terminals. each has its own
control panel, which receives the radio signal
from the atomic clock via an antenna on the
roof. this ensures that the correct time is
displayed on all of the approximately 1,700
clocks. if one is defective, girousis’ colleagues
fix it right away. especially when working in
the building interiors, the wrong cable can
be quickly snipped by accident.

     largest pharmaceutical hub in europe

     aircraft do more than just make travel possible for passengers in all countries all over the world.
     as the largest german cargo hub – and one of the most important sites in europe – frankfurt
     airport provides the infrastructure that the export-oriented german economy needs to be
     able to react quickly with its goods and services in the major growth markets. automotive
     and it products as well perishable goods and products of the pharmaceutical industry are
     transported via this major hub. in 2016, around 100,000 tons of vaccines, pharmaceuticals
     and other pharmaceutical products were handled at frankfurt airport, making frankfurt the
     largest pharmaceutical distribution hub in europe.

     transporting this sensitive cargo requires particularly reliable and professional handling.
     fra has more than 7,000 m² of certified, temperature-controlled handling areas. at the end
     of this year, more than 10,000 m² will be available. during transport on the apron, special
     thermo transporters guarantee a constant temperature of – 30 to +30 degrees celsius be-
     fore the goods are loaded into the aircraft’s cargo space, which is brought to the correct
     temperature in advance.

     to expand its leading market position, fraport and air cargo community frankfurt are seeking
     continuous certification of the process chain. in 2017, 95 % of the freight handling and 85 %
     of transports on the apron will be awarded the ceiv (center of excellence of independent
     validators) pharmaceutical certification of the international air transport association (iata).

               fraport is internationally one of the leading companies in the airport
               business and, with frankfurt airport, operates one of the world’s most
               important aviation hubs. about 81,000 people work at frankfurt airport
               and 18,300 of these work solely for fraport. as an active partner for
               the region, we support sports, social, and cultural clubs and institutions.
               in addition, fraport has also always been committed to contributing
               to the reduction of aircraft noise pollution. we are continuously
               attempting to reduce noise pollution through active and passive
               noise abatement measures.

     daphne goldmann is a physicist, and she understands the issues of aircraft noise and noise abatement
     from many angles. before joining fraport in 2001, she worked as a noise abatement specialist and expert
     for different engineering firms. today, she manages the aircraft noise measurement and assessment
     department. her team, which consists of seven aircraft noise controllers and two specialists for evaluation
     and reporting, has a core mission: it operates a monitoring system around the clock for the automatic
     measurement of aircraft noise.

     personal commitment was needed for the “maltese social day”, which was
     attended by five administrative employees of fraport subsidiary fraground
     fraport ground services gmbh (formerly airport personal service gmbh).
     the kindergarten of the protestant parish auferstehungsgemeinde in the
     praunheim district in frankfurt had asked for help with renovation work.
     the employees painted the workshop and its washroom. the company
     gave the employees the day off to do this work. on this day, approximately
     1,100 participants spent 4,000 working hours carrying out about 100
     projects in the frankfurt area.

5)
   the significant increase in the number of bird strikes corresponds to the trend across germany. it can be assumed that the number of bird strikes has not
   increased, but rather the number of reports. this is because in accordance with eu regulation 376/2014 and implementing provision (eu) 2015/1080 annex iv
   beginning in november 2015 all airport operators, air traffic controllers, ground handling services and aircraft pilots in europe are now uniformly required to
   report security-related incidents (here bird strikes).
