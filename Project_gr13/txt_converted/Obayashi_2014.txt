                   toward a brighter future

obayashi’s vision, values and commitments
in 2011, the 120th year since our founding, obayashi’s vision, values and commitments were formulated
with the aim of the obayashi group becoming one of the world’s most successful environmentally
­responsible enterprises.
   this vision to be one of the world’s most successful environmentally responsible enterprises, ­presented
under “vision: who we want to be” below, expresses our conviction toward the concepts of “an inclusive
 environment” that extends to the people of the world and the global environment, and “being responsible” in
 order to provide safety, security, and comfort.
   each and every employee of the group is focused on understanding the meaning and spirit carried by
obayashi’s vision, values and commitments and proceeding with their daily work on that same trajectory. in this
 way, obayashi will contribute to the creation of a sustainable world and strive to increase its corporate value.




   vision: who we want to be
   the people of obayashi want to be a part of one of the world’s most successful environmentally
   responsible enterprises. inspired by the principle of sustainability, we pledge to:
   1. exercise true craftsmanship and employ superior technologies to make every space as valuable as it can be.
   2. show concern for the global environment and contribute solutions to social challenges like a good corporate
       citizen should.
   3. value everyone we come in contact with in our business.



   social responsibility: our unique approach
   at obayashi, we think of fulfilling our corporate responsibilities as the best way to bring smiles to people. this is the goal of all of our
   business activities. as a good corporate citizen, obayashi strives to meet the expectations and needs of all stakeholders. the word
   for “smiles” in japanese is egao. we use the four letters of this word to remind us of our responsibilities to society.

since its founding, the obayashi group has been committed to meeting the trust of its customers, shareholders and
other stakeholders by exercising true craftsmanship and employing superior technologies.
  today, factors from economic globalization to a maturing construction market, low birthrates, and societal aging in
japan are reshaping our business environment. in this climate, we will rise to transform the scope and structure of our
business and maximize corporate value as we refine our technologies and pass down our heritage of integrity.

 3. progress with medium-term business plan ’12
(1) changes in the business environment
launched in the fiscal year ended march 31, 2013, our
medium-term plan was formulated with several assumptions.
these included a sluggish japanese economy, contraction of
the domestic construction market, and a subsequent increase
in the intensity of competition for receiving orders. as a result,
the policy we enacted was to continue to enhance the profit-
ability of the domestic construction and real estate businesses,
our core fields, and to diversify our earnings base through

     major development complex project in the center of tokyo
     we are currently working on a major development complex project on a 2.2 hectare (5.3 acre) site in
     shinjuku ward, tokyo (lead developer: sumitomo realty & development co., ltd.).
       the project will construct a pair of high-rise towers located within the yamanote line loop. one
     building will be a 37-story office and condominium tower with a multipurpose hall, while the other will
     be a 26-story seismically-isolated condominium tower with commercial facilities and a public plaza.
       the condominium tower will be completed first in december 2014, while the office and condo-
     minium tower will be completed in march 2016.

                                                                                                                  perspective drawing of the

     technology for safely and securely completing the project in a short period
     obayashi is using the lrv (left right vertical installation pca*) method for the project’s condominium tower in order to construct a
     high-quality building in a short period.
        the lrv method uses pca columns and beams that eliminate the need to cast concrete on site and thereby significantly reduce
     the construction period.

     * pca: precast concrete. concrete structural components prefabricated in factories.

the lrv method comprises lr-beams with integrated joints
and v-columns, which are prefabricated in factories and then

assembled at the construction site (see diagram to the right).
   the main differences between the lrv method and the
conventional method of on-site concrete casting using steel
reinforcing and formwork are as follows:

· concrete structural components are prefabricated, so
   ­columns and beams can be built in advance, significantly
    reducing construction period.                                                                                                              v-column

· complex reinforcing bar arrangements are preassembled at
    the factory to improve on-site construction efficiency.
· prefabrication in a stable factory environment ensures high-
    quality concrete structural components.

      shield tunneling with minimum impact on people and the environment
      in order to protect the environment surrounding the route, approximately 70% of the new expressway will structurally be tunnels.
         most of the main tunnel will be excavated using large-diameter, earth pressure balanced-type shield machines measuring 12.5
      meters (41 feet) in outer diameter. access road sections* where the main tunnel widens as it branches out at the entrance and exit
      to merge with the road will be constructed using technology that widens the tunnel frame from inside of the main tunnel (shield
      expansion method and pipe roof method).

      * access road sections: sections where the main tunnel widens as it branches out at the entrance and exit to merge with the road.

                                           provide high-quality buildings and structures
                                    obayashi corporation has introduced new ict for construction management to transform construction
                                    site work styles. these include tablets, cloud computing, building information modeling (bim), and
                                    ­construction information modeling (cim).
                                         the development and operation of such new ict construction tools, realizing higher construction
                                     quality and management efficiency, has enabled obayashi to satisfy customers with buildings and
                                     ­structures of an even finer quality.

                                      use of tablets
                                    obayashi has been providing tablets to on-site engineers managing construction since 2012. in the fiscal
                                    year ended march 31, 2014, a cumulative total of 4,600 tablets had been provided, a 50% increase from
                                    the previous fiscal year.
                                      the tablets contain lots of information needed for on-site management, such as blueprints and specifi-
                                    cation sheets. other important data can be downloaded from cloud-based servers, enabling speedy
                                    confirmations. we have promoted these small, lightweight tablets with portability convenient for on-site
                                    engineers as their tool for enhancing construction quality and management efficiency.

                            to address such needs, when we built the grand

                            as a result, the buildings received the s (excellent) rating under the comprehensive assessment
                        system for built environment efficiency (casbee®). the buildings are also on the way to becoming the

                           disaster debris disposal operations
                         obayashi took part in the waste disposal of approximately 940,000 tons of disaster debris and tsunami
                         sediment from watari district, miyagi prefecture and other areas affected by the great east japan
                        ­earthquake*1. the debris was thoroughly sorted and useful materials were recycled for use in earthquake
                        reconstruction projects.
                           at the same time, disaster debris that normally cannot be recycled, was solidified in cement to create
                        upcycle blocks*2 for recycling as construction material. we plan to make effective use of the upcycle
                        blocks as embankment material in constructing land for parks and green spaces, as well as elevated
                        evacuation sites. thanks to these efforts, we have achieved a compacting rate of 98% from the resource
                        recycling and incineration in our disposal operations.

                       species of water scorpion       transplanting activity
                       (nepa hoffmanni). this
                       aquatic insect is a natural monument of kuwana city, and has been designated as an endangered spe-
                       cies in the red data book of mie prefecture. the water scorpions are about 2 centimeters (a little less
                       than an inch) in size, and require swamplands fed with pristine spring water to survive.
                          in proceeding with construction in and around the habitat, we cooperate closely with the client, as well
                       as the boards of conservation and education of kuwana city, to protect the swamplands by making
                       certain that the supply of water from upstream is uninterrupted. furthermore, in situations where the
                       planned construction site overlaps with the habitat, we have temporarily transplanted the habitat away
                       from the construction area.

      kaeru kawauchi jv project office

                                        the jv project office carried out decontamination of radioactive materials in kawauchi village,
                                        fukushima prefecture, in a special decontamination area designated by the japanese government.
                                        kaeru kawauchi is a project name playing on the japanese word kaeru, which means both “frog”
                                        and “return home.” the name expresses the strong desire of the evacuated residents to return
                                        home to their village famous throughout japan for its pristine brooks, which are the habitat of the

          importance of maintaining close communications
      it was important for the project team to get to know the local people and allay
      their anxieties over the decontamination work. in addition to greeting the com-
      munity members on a daily basis and other general communications, we
      helped to run events such as charity concerts, get-togethers for pounding rice
      cakes and putting up christmas lights at the temporary housing. apart from
      providing enjoyment, these events were an important way to convey our
      ­sincere intentions and win the trust of the evacuees.
                                                                                                        the get-together for pounding

          our sincere intentions
      what the residents of kawauchi village need to go back to their normal lives is
      not only the restoration of their pastoral mountains, brooks, farmlands and
      livestock, but also ordinary daily routines free from anxiety. with this in mind,
      the kaeru kawauchi jv project office worked not only on the decontamination
      of radioactive material, but also aimed to create a safe and secure environment
      so that the villagers of kawauchi can return as soon as possible.

                                                                                                        members of the jv project office with the villagers

                      management from a position independent of the company. the outside corporate auditors are respon-
                      sible for ensuring that corporate governance functions effectively by providing checks from a third-party
                      position independent of management.

                        collaboration between corporate auditors and the independent auditor
                        and the support structure
                        the corporate auditors and the independent auditor each conduct audits from their independent stand-
                        points, with the corporate auditors receiving reports and briefings as required from the independent
                        auditor. the two parties also cooperate to raise the effectiveness of audits by sharing information and
                        opinions. meanwhile, as obayashi’s internal audit arm, the business administration department is
                        responsible for audits conducted separately from the corporate auditors and independent auditor. per-
                        formed according to obayashi’s internal audit regulations, these audits monitor the effectiveness of
                        internal control and the execution of duties by each department within the company. the corporate
                        auditors and business administration department cooperate as well to raise the effectiveness of audits

                        and the independent auditor
                        the basic policy with regards to director remuneration is to determine the amount of remuneration for
                        each business term in accordance with actual contribution to earnings, in order to secure outstanding
                        human resources and to provide incentive to each director to improve earnings and enhance corporate
                        value. specifically, the board of directors has set a remuneration table in accordance with title and earn-
                        ings contribution ranking, and at the end of each business term, the remuneration committee, which is
                        chaired by the president and comprises members delegated by the committee chairperson, appraises
                        the degree of earnings contribution of individual directors and determines the amount of remuneration
                        for the following fiscal year.
                           the basic policy with regards to the remuneration of the corporate auditors is to set an amount
                        required to secure outstanding human resources in order to have corporate governance function effec-
                        tively. specifically, remuneration standards are set up in advance in accordance with full-time and part-
                        time status, etc., through discussions among corporate auditors, and remuneration for each corporate
                        auditor is determined in line with those standards.
                           with regards to remuneration of the independent auditor, the auditing structure and auditing time
                        required for an appropriate accounting audit is discussed with the auditing firm, taking into account the

                        is determined with the approval of the audit committee.

notes to consolidated financial statements
obayashi corporation
for the years ended march 31, 2014 and 2013




1. basis of presenting consolidated financial statements
                                     the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the accounts maintained by
                                     obayashi corporation (the “company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “companies”) in accordance
                                     with accounting principles generally accepted in japan, which are different in certain respects as to the appli-
                                     cation and disclosure requirements of international financial reporting standards, and are compiled from the
                                     consolidated financial statements prepared by the company as required by the financial instruments and
                                     exchange law of japan.
                                     certain amounts in the prior year’s financial statements were reclassified to conform to the changes made for
                                     the latest fiscal year.



2. u.s. dollar amounts
                                     the accounts of the consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in japanese yen by
                                     rounding down to the nearest million. the u.s. dollar amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated
                                     financial statements and notes thereto were translated from the original japanese yen into u.s. dollars on the
                                     basis of ¥102.92 to us$1, the rate of exchange prevailing at march 31, 2014, and were then rounded down
                                     to the nearest thousand. the approximate rate of exchange prevailing at may 31, 2014 was ¥101.66=u.s.$1.
                                     these u.s. dollar amounts are not intended to imply that the japanese yen amounts have been or could be
                                     converted, realized or settled in u.s. dollars at this or any other rate.



3. summary of significant accounting policies
                                     (1) scope of consolidation and application of the equity method
                                     the company had 85 subsidiaries at march 31, 2014. the consolidated financial statements as of and for
                                     the years ended march 31, 2014 and 2013 included the accounts of the company and all subsidiaries.
                                     all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. investments in all affiliates (27
                                     ­companies for 2014) are accounted for by the equity method.

                                     (2) business year for consolidated subsidiaries
                                     certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (31 companies) and a domestic consolidated subsidiary (1 company)
                                     have a fiscal year that ends on december 31. certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (5 companies) have a
                                     fiscal year that ends on february 28. the consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the
                                     financial statements as of the same date or provisional settlement based on the latest quarterly financial
                                     statements. necessary adjustments for consolidation were made on significant transactions that took place
                                     during the period between the fiscal year-end of the subsidiaries and that of the company. consolidated
                                     subsidiaries other than those referred to above have the same business year as the company, which ends on
                                     march 31.

                                     (3) goodwill
                                     goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 5 years. however, goodwill that is not
                                     material is charged to income in the year of acquisition.
                                     differences between the cost and underlying net equity of investments in affiliates accounted for by the equity
                                     method are charged or credited to income as they occur.

                                     (4) foreign currency translation
                                     receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into japanese yen at the rate of
                                     exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
                                     the resulting exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the consolidated statements
                                     of income.
                                     the balance sheet accounts of the foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into japanese yen at the
                                     rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding
                                     minority interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. revenue and expense accounts are
                                     translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. differences arising from the transla-
                                     tion are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments and minority interests in the consolidated
                                     financial statements.

                        (5) cash equivalents
                        all highly liquid investments, generally with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, which are
                        readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are so near maturity that they represent only an insignifi-
                        cant risk of any change in value attributable to changes in interest rates, are considered cash equivalents.

                        (6) short-term investment securities and investment securities
                        securities are classified into two categories: held-to-maturity and other securities. held-to-maturity securities
                        are carried at amortized cost. marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with
                        changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets.
                        non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost. cost of securities sold is deter-
                        mined by the moving average method.

                        (7) inventories
                        real estate held for sale, costs on uncompleted construction contracts, costs on real estate business,
                        ­inventories for pfi and other projects and costs on other business are all stated at cost determined by the
                         specific identification method.
                         raw materials and supplies are stated at cost determined by the first-in first-out method.
                         the net book value of inventories in the balance sheets is written down if the net realizable value declines.

                        (8) property, plant and equipment
                        the company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries mainly calculate depreciation by the declining-
                        balance method, while the straight-line method is applied to buildings, excluding building fixtures, acquired
                        on or after april 1, 1998. foreign consolidated subsidiaries mainly apply the straight-line method.
                        the useful lives and residual values of depreciable assets are estimated mainly in accordance with the
                        ­corporate tax law.

                        (9) intangible assets
                        intangible fixed assets are amortized by the straight-line method. computer software for internal use is
                        ­amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 5 years.

                        (10) leased assets
                        depreciation of leased assets under finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased assets to the
                        lessee is calculated by the straight-line method over the lease period with a residual value of zero.

                        (11) allowance for doubtful accounts
                        the allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on the historical experience with respect to write-
                        offs for the company and its domestic subsidiaries and based on an estimate of the amount for specific
                        uncollectible accounts for the companies.

                        (12) provision for warranties for completed construction
                        the provision for warranties for completed construction is provided to cover expenses for defects claimed
                        concerning completed work, based on the estimated amount of compensation to be paid in the future for the
                        work completed during the fiscal year.

                        (13) provision for loss on construction contracts
                        the provision for loss on construction contracts is provided at the estimated amount for the future losses
                        on contract backlog at the balance sheet date which will probably be incurred and which can be reason-
                        ably estimated.

                          (15) provision for environmental measures
                          the provision for environmental measures is provided based on an estimate of costs for disposal of
                          ­polychlorinated biphenyl (pcb) waste, which the company and its domestic subsidiaries are obliged to
                           ­dispose of by the act on special measures concerning promotion of proper treatment of pcb waste.

                          (16) retirement benefits
                          in calculating retirement benefit obligations, the straight-line method is used to allocate expected retirement
                          benefit payments in the period until the end of the current fiscal year.
                          actuarial differences are amortized commencing in the following year after the differences are recognized
                          ­primarily by the straight-line method over periods (5 to 10 years) which are shorter than the average remain-
                           ing years of service of the employees.
                           prior service cost (psc) is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years which is shorter
                           than the average remaining years of service of the employees, while psc of certain subsidiaries is expensed
                           as incurred.

                          (17) derivatives and hedge accounting
                          (a) method of hedge accounting
                          hedging instruments are valued at fair value and accounted for using the deferral method of accounting.
                          the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, for which foreign exchange forward
                          contracts or currency options are used to hedge the foreign currency fluctuations, are translated at the
                          ­contracted rate if the foreign exchange forward contracts or currency options qualify for hedge accounting.
                           the interest rate swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria, are not
                           remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is charged to
                           income (short-cut method).

                          (b) hedging instruments and hedged items
                          to hedge foreign exchange risks related to the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
                          ­currencies and projected future foreign currency transactions, foreign exchange forward contracts and non-
                           deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts are employed as hedging instruments. to hedge the interest
                           rate risks and foreign exchange risks related to loans payable and transactions of affiliates, interest rate
                           swaps or interest rate/currency swaps are employed as hedging instruments.

                          (c) hedging policy
                          the companies utilize derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of hedging future risks of fluctua-
                          tion of foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates in accordance with internal rules.

                          (d) assessment of hedge effectiveness
                          hedge effectiveness is not assessed when substantial terms and conditions of the hedging instruments and
                          the hedged transactions are the same.
                          the evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted for interest rate swaps as they meet certain criteria under
                          the short-cut method.

                          (18) recognizing revenues and costs of construction contracts
                          revenues and costs of construction contracts of which the percentage of completion can be reliably esti-
                          mated are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. the percentage of completion is calculated
                          at the cost incurred as a percentage of the estimated total cost. the completed-contract method continues
                          to be applied for contracts for which the percentage of completion cannot be reliably estimated.
                          revenues from construction contracts and the related costs of the overseas subsidiaries are mainly recorded
                          on the percentage-of-completion method.

                          (19) revenues and expenses associated with finance lease transactions
                          sales and cost of sales are recognized upon receipt of lease payment.

                          (20) consumption taxes
                          consumption tax and local consumption tax are accounted for under the tax-exclusive method.

                        (21) income taxes
                        the companies apply deferred tax accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of income taxes
                        by the asset/liability method.
                        under the asset/liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
                        between financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the
                        enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

                        (22) consolidated taxation system
                        the companies adopted the consolidated taxation system.



4. change in accounting policies
                        the company adopted “accounting standard for retirement benefits” (asbj statement no. 26 of may 17,
                        2012) and “guidance on accounting standard for retirement benefits” (asbj guidance no. 25 of may 17,
                        2012) (except for certain provisions described in the main clause in section 35 of the standard and in the
                        main clause of section 67 of the guidance) as of the end of the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014. these
                        standards require entities to apply a revised method for recording the retirement benefit obligation, after
                        deducting pension plan assets, as an asset and a liability for retirement benefits. in addition, unrecognized
                        actuarial differences and unrecognized prior service costs are recorded as an asset and a liability for retire-
                        ment benefits. concerning the application of the accounting standard for retirement benefits, based on the
                        provisional treatment set out in section 37 of the standard, the effects of such changes in the current fiscal
                        year have been recorded in retirement benefit asset and liability adjustments of accumulated other compre-
                        hensive income. as a result of this change, an asset and a liability for retirement benefits were recognized in
                        the amount of ¥156 million (us$1,523 thousand) and ¥57,785 million (us$561,465 thousand), respectively,
                        and accumulated other comprehensive income increased by ¥665 million (us$6,466 thousand) as of march
                        31, 2014. the impact on net assets per share is listed in the relevant section.



5. standards issued but not yet effective
                        “accounting standard for retirement benefits” (asbj statement no. 26 of may 17, 2012) and “guidance on
                        accounting standard for retirement benefits” (asbj guidance no. 25 of may 17, 2012)

                        (1) overview
                        these standards provide guidance for the accounting for unrecognized actuarial differences and unrecog-
                        nized prior service costs, the calculation methods of retirement benefit obligations and service costs, and
                        enhancement of disclosures.

                        (2) scheduled date of adoption
                        revisions to the calculation methods for the retirement benefit obligations and service costs are scheduled to be
                        adopted from the beginning of the fiscal year ending march 31, 2015, which are not to be applied retroactively.

                        (3) impact of adopting revised standard and guidance
                        the company is currently evaluating the impact these modifications will have on its consolidated results of
                        operations and financial position.

                          (3) revaluation reserve for land
                          pursuant to the “law concerning the revaluation of land,” land used for business operations was revalued
                          on march 31, 2000. the excess of the revalued carrying amount over the book value before revaluation is
                          included in net assets as reserve for land revaluation, net of applicable income taxes.
                          the revaluation of the land was determined based on the official standard notice prices in accordance with
                          article 2, paragraph 1 of the “enforcement ordinance concerning land revaluation” and the appraisal value
                          made by the certified real estate appraisers in accordance with article 2, paragraph 5 of the same ordinance

                        valuation method
                        the companies recognize impairment losses for individual items classified as: 1) real estate reclassified as
                        “held for sale,” 2) real estate for lease, 3) real estate reclassified as “held for development,” 4) idle real
                        estate, and 5) others.
                        due to the decrease in fair value and profitability of real estate, the companies reduced the carrying values of
                        these assets to their recoverable amounts and recognized the declines as impairment losses.
                        the recoverable amounts of the assets were the net realizable values, which were calculated as the selling
                        prices (estimated based on the japanese real estate appraisal standards) less applicable sales expenses.

                           (1) overview
                           (a) policy for financial instruments
                           the companies raise funds by borrowing from banks and issuing commercial paper or corporate bonds.
                           also, the companies restrict temporary excess fund management to highly secure assets, time deposits and
                           other short-term investments. the companies use derivatives in order to avoid the risks, fluctuations of
                           ­particular assets and liabilities, and fluctuations of interest rates. the companies do not use derivative
                            ­transactions to gain short-term profits or for speculative purposes.

                           (b) types of financial instruments, related risks and risk management
                           “notes and accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other” and “accounts receiv-
                           able—other,” which are operating receivables, are exposed to the credit risk of customers. in order to miti-
                           gate the risk when orders are received, the companies conduct a strict screening and determine project
                           plans so that potential risks are minimized.
                           “short-term investment securities” and “investment securities” mainly consist of stocks. while short-term
                           investment securities and investment securities are exposed to market risk, the companies monitor market
                           prices of these securities.
                           “notes and accounts payable for construction contracts and other” and “deposits received,” which are oper-
                           ating liabilities, are due within one year.
                           “short-term loans payable,” “long-term loans payable,” “commercial papers” and “bonds payable” are
                           used for operations or capital investment.
                           “pfi and other project finance loans” are used for enterprise funds related to particular pfi and other projects.
                           floating rate loans are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. in order to hedge against the interest rate
                           risks and fix the payment of interest, the companies utilize derivative transactions (interest rate swaps) for
                           each contract of certain long-term loans payable. the ­evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted for
                           ­interest rate swaps as they meet certain criteria under the short-cut method.
                            the transactions of derivative financial instruments are carried out in accordance with the companies’ inter-
                            nal rules, and the status of the transactions is reported regularly to the board of directors. the companies
                            trade derivative transactions with major financial institutions and therefore consider there is no credit risk
                            underlying those transactions.
                            while operating debt and borrowings are exposed to liquidity risk, the companies manage the risk mainly by
                            preparing quarterly and monthly cash management plans.

                           (c) supplementary explanation of fair values of financial instruments
                           notional amounts of derivative transactions, disclosed in “(2) fair value of financial instruments,” do not
                           ­indicate market risk in derivative transactions.

15. retirement benefit plans
                        for the year ended march 31, 2014
                        the company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans (cash balance plan in the company
                        and its certain subsidiaries), in addition to lump-sum payments covering the remainder. certain subsidiaries
                        have defined contribution pension plans.
                        the following tables show the funded and accrued status of the plans and the amounts recognized in the
                        consolidated balance sheet at march 31, 2014 of the company and its subsidiaries.
                        (additional information)
                        an agreement between labor and management of the company was reached on november 19, 2013, by
                        adopting the defined contribution pension plan partially instead of the defined benefit pension plan on or after
                        april 1, 2014. this transition is accounted for in accordance with the “revision of accounting standard for
                        accrued retirement benefits (implementation guidance on accounting standards; guidance no. 1)” and
                        other income of ¥2,450 million (us$23,805 thousand) is to be posted for the year ending march 31, 2015.

                        april 1, 2014.
                        as a result, the statutory corporate tax rate used to measure the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities
                        was changed from 37.8% to 35.5% for temporary differences expected to reverse and tax loss carryforwards
                        expected to be utilized in the fiscal years beginning on or after april 1, 2014. the effect of the reduction of the
                        statutory corporate tax rate was to decrease deferred tax assets, net by ¥1,364 million (us$13,253 thou-
                        sand) and increase deferred income taxes by ¥1,367 million (us$13,288 thousand) as of and for the year
                        ended march 31, 2014.



17. asset retirement obligations
                        asset retirement obligations recognized by the companies are mainly obligations to restore rental properties
                        for business use under real estate lease contracts at the time the lease agreement is terminated. instead of
                        recording asset retirement obligations, the companies have estimated total unrefundable deposits on lease
                        contracts and expensed the current portion.
                        estimated total unrefundable deposits and periods of use of the rental properties are as follows:

19. segment information
                           (1) segment information
                           (a) overview of reportable segments
                           the reportable segments of the companies are components for which discrete financial information is avail-
                           able and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the executive committee to make decisions
                           about resource allocation and to assess performance.
                           the building construction, civil engineering and real estate development divisions at the company are
                           responsible for strategic planning and business development of the building construction, civil engineering
                           and real estate development businesses, respectively. business operations of the building construction and
                           civil engineering divisions are classified geographically with headquarters and each branch as separate
                           ­operating units and evaluated individually. the company’s subsidiaries are also evaluated on an individual
                            basis. the building construction and civil engineering businesses are segmented based on domestic and
                            overseas areas.
                            the companies therefore have five reportable segments: “domestic building construction,” “overseas
                            ­building construction,” “domestic civil engineering,” “overseas civil engineering” and “real estate.”
                             the overview of each reportable segment is as follows:
                             domestic building construction:	execution of building construction contracts and related businesses
                                                               within japan
                           overseas building construction:	execution of building construction contracts and related businesses
                                                               outside japan
                           domestic civil engineering:	execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related
                                                               ­businesses within japan
                           overseas civil engineering:	execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related
                                                                ­businesses outside japan
                           real estate:	purchase, sale and rent of real estate properties, development of land
                                                                 ­parcels and related businesses

                           (b) accounting treatment for net sales, income (loss) , assets, liabilities and others by each segment
                           the accounting methods of the segments are substantially the same as those described in note 3 “summary
                           of significant accounting policies.” segment performance is evaluated based on operating income or loss.
                           intersegment sales are recorded at the same prices used in transactions with third parties.
