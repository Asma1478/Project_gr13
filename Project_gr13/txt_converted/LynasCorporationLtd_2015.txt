lynas corporation limited | 2015 annual report                                  1

letter from the chairman

             i am pleased to be addressing you, our shareholders, in the
             first annual report since i was appointed as non-executive
             chairman of the lynas board in january.
             in the last year, lynas has achieved significant milestones, greatly improved business
             performance and created exciting opportunities for growth within the rare earths market.
             in lynas’ second full year of production, 8,799 tonnes of rare earth oxides was
             produced, up from 3,965 tonnes last financial year. q1 fy16 production output is
             expected to exceed 3,000 tonnes. this result is testament to the strong leadership of
             our ceo, amanda lacaze, and the hard work of each member of the lynas team. the
             team resolved issues associated with the cracking and leaching, and solvent extraction
             processes earlier this year, and we are now producing at a stable and consistent rate.
             lynas has a strong continuous improvement culture. in the past year we have created
             a stable operating platform and reinforced the balance sheet. the current dynamics of
             the global rare earths market are our next challenge. market prices decreased during
             fy15 and the continuing uncertainty of chinese government policy meant many
             customers were satisfied to consume inventories rather than purchase fresh product.
             growing demand in target segments is our current focus.
             rare earths are an important functional material crucial to the delivery of key product
             benefits that we all value as consumers. we are developing and strengthening lynas’
             relationships with customers in key sectors, such as the global automotive market
             and energy efficient consumer products. these relationships are important as we see
             engineers and designers respond to consumer demand and look to ways to create
             functionality in products that can best be achieved using rare earths.
             one of the difficulties with the rare earths market is that it is marked by speculative
             activity in all stages of the value chain. whilst we expect a level of uncertainty in the
             market to continue in the near term, we remain focused on becoming the strongest
             performing company within the rare earths sector. our full year results reflect lynas’
             determination to build a company whose valuation is based on performance rather
             than speculation.
             in the last year, the rare earths industry has also experienced a number of changes.
             the chinese tax regime is now relatively clear and export taxes are gone, which should
             improve the competitiveness of the magnet supply chains outside of china and
             ultimately that should be good for lynas.
             ideally, the healthiest markets are ones where there are many suppliers who are healthy
             and capable. as many of you would have seen, molycorp, the only rare earth miner and
             producer outside of china apart from lynas, recently filed for chapter 11 in the usa
             and announced the closure of its mountain pass mining and processing facility.

“...it is our                                    the presence of lynas as a competitor in the rare earths market is important to the
                                                 health of the global rare earths industry. the current volatility in the market has the
commitment that                                  effect of limiting demand as end users respond to a perception of uncertainty regarding
                                                 both supply and pricing. lynas’ competitive presence is good for every participant in
lynas will continue                              the rare earths industry, particularly end users who can be confident in formulating rare
                                                 earths into their products knowing that lynas will continue to offer an environmentally
to operate safely                                assured and reliable supply of high quality rare earth materials.

and efficiently for                              in june this year, lynas also welcomed the report by the international atomic energy
                                                 agency (iaea), which confirmed that the radiological risks to the public and envi-
its staff and the                                ronment at the lynas advanced materials plant (lamp) are intrinsically low. it is our
                                                 commitment that lynas will continue to operate safely and efficiently for its staff and
communities and                                  the communities and environments in which we operate.
                                                 one of our most significant announcements was made in august this year, when lynas
environments in                                  reached a new long-term debt structure agreement with our strategic debt providers,
                                                 jare, and the mt kellett led group of bondholders. the new structure strengthens the
which we operate.”                               company’s financial position, extends the debt maturity profile and underpins the
                                                 recent initiatives to position lynas as a sustainable and financially viable business.
                                                 i would like to thank each member of the lynas team for their efforts this last year.
                                                 lynas has consistently improved business performance in all areas: production, sales,
                                                 cost reduction and cash management. it could not have been done without the
                                                 exceptional team culture of empowerment and excellence.
                                                 to our valued customers, suppliers and business partners, thank you for your ongoing
                                                 commitment to lynas and for strategically aligning yourselves with our business.
                                                 to the kuantan and mt weld communities, we look forward to working together with
                                                 you and contributing to the local economy and community enrichment initiatives in
                                                 the year to come.
                                                 finally, to our shareholders, we thank you for your patience and support of lynas. your
                                                 board is confident that lynas is well positioned for the future and for opportunities to
                                                 increase shareholder value.

ceo review

             the last financial year has been significant in the history
             of our company. in the past year, lynas has successfully
             transitioned from project status to a fully operational
             business, delivering improved and improving results on all
             key business measures. production capability has improved
             and stabilised, sales revenue has grown, costs have been
             reduced and new debt agreements have been reached,
             which underpin ongoing operations.
             in addition, we have farewelled founder and chairman nick curtis, welcomed mike
             harding as non executive chairman, philippe etienne as non executive director, and
             relocated our main office to kuantan in malaysia.
             a year ago we made a commitment to shareholders that we would tackle each issue in
             the business with careful and disciplined management. this included underperformance in
             production, efficiency, revenue, market share, and cost structure. i am pleased to say that
             in the last year, lynas has successfully completed change programs in all of these areas.
             a number of notable achievements include:
                •• positive free cashflow for the june quarter: a first in the history of lynas
                •• much improved production output, which is now stable and at target rates
                •• healthy revenue growth achieved by building strong relationships with key
                   customers, particularly in the japanese market
                •• resetting the company’s cost base, with annualised savings in excess of
                   a$40 million achieved
                •• raising a$83 million less expenses from the entitlement offer in october 2014
                •• relocating lynas’ principal administrative office from sydney to kuantan in
                   october 2014
                •• granting of the full stage operating license for the lynas advanced materials
                   plant (lamp) in september 2014
                •• new improved contracts with many of our key suppliers. one important
                   example of this is the agreement with our major chemical supplier which has
                   allowed lynas to avoid future penalty payments over the course of the contract
                   (previously provisioned at a$42.3 million)
                •• establishing a new long-term debt agreement with japan australia rare earths
                   bv (jare) and the mt kellett led group of bondholders

in the final quarter,                            positive free cash flow

lynas produced                                   year. this improved outcome is the result of a well-executed strategic plan as well as a
                                                 shift in culture to one of empowerment and improvement. i want to congratulate every

output is expected                               in july 2014, lynas announced an operational improvement plan targeting improved
                                                 organisational efficiency and reduced costs.
to exceed 3,000                                  implementation of this plan – which addressed a number of commercial elements
tonnes.                                          including reducing overhead costs and reviewing supply contracts – has allowed us to
                                                 deliver annualised savings in excess of a$40 million. the effect of this is that we now
                                                 have a cost base that is appropriate to a business of our size.
                                                 as a business we will continue to focus on optimising production costs and to look
                                                 for further opportunities to deliver savings.

                                                 customers
                                                 at lynas, we continue to work closely with our strategic customers; strengthening
                                                 relationships, and understanding product needs and usage patterns.
                                                 a focus on product quality has enabled lynas to build strong relationships with key
                                                 customers, particularly in the japanese market, which is the most important market
                                                 for our products.
                                                 our goal is to further develop a strong and loyal core customer base that values the
                                                 reliability, dependability and assured environmental provenance of lynas’ products.

                                                 production
                                                 lynas production rates improved through the year. in the final quarter, lynas produced
                                                 2,606 tonnes and in q1 fy16, production output is expected to exceed 3,000 tonnes.
                                                 as production rates have now stabilised at target rates, focus will now shift to core
                                                 production costs, with a detailed program to improve recovery rates at both mt weld
                                                 and the lamp. by continuing to reduce the cost/kg produced, we aim to mitigate the
                                                 effects of the current low market prices.

                     production and operational milestones and signal the good progress in lynas’ turnaround.
                     lynas has delivered on the goals outlined at the beginning of this financial year.
                     the changes delivered in fy15 provide us with a solid operating and business platform.
                     our key focus in fy16 will be to work with customers and with the broader rare earths
                     market to build the confidence of end users to use, and therefore to increase total
                     demand for rare earths products.
                     within a growing market, lynas can now confidently present itself as the most
                     desirable supplier of rare earths, based on a record of supply reliability, product quality
                     and most importantly our ability to provide environmentally assured rare earth
                     products. we believe these benefits will allow us to continue to deliver improvements
                     in business performance.

directors’ report




review of operations
highlights
     •• the ramp up of the malaysian plant (‘lamp”) experienced continuing production issues in the cracking and leaching (c&l) and
        solvent extraction (sx) stages, affecting production output through the year. these have been managed and resolved and by the end
        of the year, production was stable and at target rates.
     •• quarterly sales volume and quarterly sales revenue increased significantly during the year, and continue to grow as production
        output grows.
     •• a focus on product quality has enabled lynas to build strong relationships with key customers, particularly in the japanese market.
     •• cost reductions of over a$40m per annum have been achieved well in excess of original targets. the company continues to work to
        achieve further reductions in the cost of production.
     •• the business reported positive cash flow in the fourth quarter.
     •• the full operating stage licence for the lamp was granted in september 2014.
     •• both of the company’s debt providers, japan australia rare earths b.v. and the mt kellett led bondholder group, continued to demonstrate
        their support for the business by extending the term of their facilities and by agreeing to other amendments to the terms of their facilities.
     •• rare earths prices declined during the year; however the company’s initiatives during the year have positioned the company to take
        advantage of any future improvements in rare earths prices.

significant progress has been made in all areas of the business during the year; however, there is still work to be done, particularly in
developing additional sales opportunities.
rare earth oxide (reo) production for the 12 months to 30 june 2015 was 8,799 tonnes (2014: 3,965 tonnes), while shipments during the
year totalled 7,883 tonnes (2014: 3,008 tonnes). production increased from 2,043 tonnes in the first quarter to 2,606 tonnes in the fourth
quarter. sales increased from 1,546 tonnes in the first quarter to 2,353 tonnes in the fourth quarter. production in the fourth quarter was
32% higher than in the third quarter and represented 30% of full year production, while shipment volume in the fourth quarter was 29%
more than in the third quarter and represented 30% of the full year total. the average selling price (revenue basis) during the financial year
was a$18.34/kg reo (2014: a$21.47/kg). the company’s most significant product is ndpr. the china domestic price (vat excluded) of ndpr
oxide declined from us$41.4/kg in july 2014 to us$37.3/kg in june 2015.
lynas products are sold to customers involved in high technology, high growth future facing industries in japan, china, vietnam, europe and
north america.
the company’s western australian and malaysian operations maintained certification to the ohsas 18001 (occupational health and safety
management systems), iso 14001 (environmental management systems) and iso 9001 (quality management systems) standards during
the year. the 12-month rolling lost time injury frequency rate as at 30 june 2015 was 1.9 per million hours worked (2014: 1.5 per million
hours). the company continued to carefully manage all residues, air, water and solid, and met or exceeded all licence requirements. in fy15,
the iaea reviewed the company’s operations in malaysia and confirmed that the lamp is low risk.
in western australia, the concentration plant performed in line with expectations during the year. until concentrate stocks run down,
the plant continues to be operated on a campaign basis, synchronised to demand from the lamp. at 30 june 2015, 5,263 dry tonnes of
concentrate (2014: 10,828 dry metric tonnes) containing 2,050 tonnes reo (2014: 4,144 tonnes) were bagged in wa ready for export. in line
with the ramp up of production at the lamp, concentrate stocks reduced by 49% (2014: 31% reduction) during the year.
at the lamp, the ramp up was achieved as key issues in the primary production stages were addressed. by the end of the year, production
was stable and at target rates.
identified bottlenecks at the lamp have been resolved. during the year, significant improvements were made in plant organisation and
operating procedures. the lamp has three main stages: cracking & leaching, solvent extraction and product finishing. the phase 2 cracking
& leaching and product finishing assets were successfully commissioned in fy14. during fy15, the company commissioned selected assets
in the phase 2 solvent extraction circuits. the sx5 circuits perform the important role of separating ndpr from lace. during the third quarter,
the company commissioned sx5 train 3. the timing for commissioning of the final sx5 train (sx5 train 4) will be determined primarily by
customer demand.
the company continues its commercialisation program of solid residues from the lamp. the company’s commercialization programs include
the use of solid residues in soil additives, fertilizers and road base material.
during the year, the company successfully implemented a number of cost saving initiatives. this included a simplification of the company’s
structure by co-locating management personnel and resources with production and sales facilities in western australia and malaysia. this
has resulted in the company’s head office relocating from sydney to kuantan, and the closure of the company’s kuala lumpur office. other
initiatives to reduce costs included reducing management personnel, reducing workforce numbers (mostly by reducing contractor positions),
improving asset utilisation, renegotiating supplier contracts and improvements in procurement practices.

other income decreased from $20.4m to $0.1m during the year as the company was not entitled to a cash rebate from the australian tax
office on research and development expenditure incurred in the year ended june 30, 2015 since its sales exceeded the entitlement threshold
of $20.0m. other income in the current year consists of a gain on sale of financial assets (2014: $0.9m).
general and administration expenses that predominantly consist of employee costs, unrecovered production costs and depreciation (net
of recovery) reduced by $84.2m during the year. in fy14, unrecovered employee costs and unrecovered production costs were $94.4m and
unrecovered depreciation was $10.7m. in fy15, production costs have been substantially accounted in cost of sales. in fy15, unrecovered
employee costs and unrecovered production costs included in general and administration expenses were reduced to $25.6m. unrecovered
depreciation was $12.5m. other general and administration expenses include insurance premiums, consultancy fees, telecommunications and
general office expenditures. net production cost recoveries improved by $61.2m in fy15.
an impairment review of the carrying value of lamp and mt weld assets was carried out, resulting in an impairment adjustment of $16.8m in
the current year. however, this adjustment is significantly lower than in the prior year when the cost and performance of the phase 2 assets
were used to assess whether the carrying value ascribed to the phase 1 assets represented fair value. the board and management consider
the assets’ book value currently reflects the corresponding fair values. the impairment adjustment is recorded as a non-cash item.
net financial expenses increased by $9.9m to $37.3m for the year ended june 30, 2015. interest income reduced by $1.5m attributable to
lower unrestricted cash balances compared to prior year. as a result of the usd and myr strengthening against the aud, the group also
realised a foreign exchange gain of $3.9m (2014: loss of $1.5m) mainly via the revaluation of bank balances denominated in usd and myr.
however, also as a result of that and since no interest has been capitalised in the current year, interest expense on loan facilities increased by
$12.9m from $25.8m to $38.7m.

directors’ report




operating cash flows
net operating cash outflows decreased by $71.2m, to $32.0m for the year ended june 30, 2015. the decrease in the net cash outflow is in
line with the group’s operational ramp-up activities and was principally driven by increased sales receipts of $96.7m offset by increased
payments to suppliers and employees of $10.2m and non-entitlement to cash-based government grants (2014: $14.1m).


investing cash flows
net investing cash outflows increased by $1m to $9.6m for the year ended june 30, 2015. even though payments for property, plant and
equipment reduced by $7.2m and payments of security bonds reduced by $6.8m, the amount of security bonds refunded reduced by $12.4m
and there had been no proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment this year (2014: $2.7m).


financing cash flows
net financing cash inflows increased by $43.7m to $51.9m for the year ended june 30, 2015. the increment mainly comprises the proceeds
from capital raising totaling $77.9m net of costs during the year compared with $40.0m raised in the prior year. net financing costs have
reduced by $5.8m.

the overall net assets of the group decreased by $118.8m during the year which primarily reflects an increase in the aud value of the
group’s usd borrowings (arising from the strengthening of the usd in fy15) and continued operating losses experienced by the group
as it ramped up performance levels at the lamp in malaysia.
cash and cash equivalents comprise $31.4m of unrestricted cash and $20.6m of restricted cash. restricted cash is available to fund future
interest payments under the jare loan facility and mt. kellett convertible bond.
inventory decreased by $11.6m, or 16% during the year. the decrease includes impairment of obsolete inventory of $4.7m. additional
decrease reflects the production ramp-up at the lamp and the reclassification of spares from wip inventory to pp&e, which more correctly
reflects the nature of the asset. as at june 30, 2015 the group continues to hold 2,050 tonnes reo (2014: 5,994 tonnes) of processed
concentrate and unprocessed ore of 213,518 tonnes (2014: 289,560 tonnes) at its mount weld operations; which are expected to be used
for production purposes over the next 6 to 18 month periods respectively.

property plant and equipment decreased by $10.7m. the decrease is predominantly related to depreciation on buildings, plant and equipment
of $38.0m and impairment loss of $12.0m offset by effects of change in exchange rates of $24.5m, additions of $9.9m and reclassification
from inventory to plant and equipment of $5.3m.
borrowings of $546.2m are represented by the usd205.0 million jare loan facility revalued to aud using the exchange rate at june 30,
2015 and the liability component of the convertible bonds issued to funds managed or selected by mt kellett capital management. during
the year, the group made $11.4m (usd10.0m) in repayments against the jare loan facility that is in line with the previously announced
repayment schedule (refer to note 24).
the increase in share capital of $49.3m is predominantly attributable to the net proceeds from the equity raising which was completed in
november 2014.
the movement in reserves of $49.4m during the current period reflects movements in the equity settled employee benefits, foreign currency
translation reserves and options issued in conjunction with the equity raising mentioned above.

risk management
the group takes a proactive approach to risk management. the directors are responsible for ensuring that risks and opportunities are
identified on a timely basis and that the group’s objectives and activities are aligned with these risks and opportunities.
the group believes that it is crucial for directors to be a part of this process, and has established a risk management, safety, health and
environment committee.



factors and business risks that affect future performance
lynas operates in a changing environment and is therefore subject to factors and business risks that will affect future performance.
the following factors and business risks could have a material effect on lynas’ future results from an operations and financial position:

rare earth prices
lynas’ sales performance is affected by market fluctuations in rare earth prices. this is because the product prices used in the majority of
lynas’ sales are calculated by a pricing formula that is tied to average rare earth market prices in the previous calendar quarter. the market
price has been volatile in the past because it is influenced by numerous factors and events that are beyond the control of lynas.

directors’ report




these include:
     (i)       production capacity
               for most rare earth products, global capacity for rare earth production, including illegal operations in china, currently exceeds
               global demand.
     (ii)      fluctuations in demand
               a key factor influencing rare earth demand is automotive market demand, both in terms of production quantity and technology
               incorporated in the vehicles manufactured. energy-efficient (hybrid/electrical), green (emission controlled) and luxury vehicles
               require significantly more rare earth materials during the manufacturing process than basic motor vehicles. the market price of
               rare earth is influenced by rare earth market traders’ expectations of the demand for energy-efficient, green and luxury vehicles as
               opposed to actual daily demand for those vehicles.
     (iii)     chinese government regulations
               china currently supplies around 90% of the global rare earths and china represents around 60% of the global demand. that has
               enabled china to encourage many downstream activities to relocate into china. as an example, chinese regulators previously
               enforced quotas and taxes on rare earth exports. in fy15, chinese regulators removed regulations on export quotas and export
               taxes, and introduced new resource and production taxes. the net effect has been a reduction in taxes on rare earths produced in
               china and a reduction in realised prices outside of china.

the table below includes the published rare earth market price over a 3-year period and illustrates its volatility. it also calculates the possible
impact on lynas’ aggregate market price.

lynas’ approach to reduce pricing volatility for its customers includes:
     •• promoting fixed pricing to its direct customers, set for periods relevant to customer operations;
     •• developing long term contracts that include clauses that aim to reduce price variations for end users such as car makers and wind
        turbine manufacturers.

exchange rates
lynas is exposed to fluctuations in the us dollar as all sales are denominated in us dollars. the company borrows money and holds a portion
of cash in us dollars, which provides a partial natural hedge.
accordingly, lynas’ income from, and the value of its business, will be affected by fluctuations in the rates by which the us dollar is
exchanged with australian dollars.
adverse movements in the australian dollar against the us dollar may have an adverse impact on lynas. the following table shows the
average usd/aud exchange rate over the last three years:

                                                                30-jun-15                           30-jun-14                           30-jun-13

operating and development risks
lynas’ operations and development activities could be affected by various unforeseen events and circumstances, which may result in
increased costs, lower production levels and, following on from that, lower revenue levels. any negative outcomes flowing from these
operational risks could have an adverse effect on lynas’ business, financial condition, profitability and performance.
lynas undertakes regular reviews of its operational, development and business interruption risks. lynas seeks to minimise the potential
damage flowing from these risks by obtaining business interruption insurance for certain events and, where available, indemnities from
suppliers and contractors.

debt covenants
lynas has financing arrangements in place which are subject to acceleration and enforcement rights in the event a default were to arise under
them. the japan australia rare earths b.v. (jare) loan facility is secured over all of the assets of the group, other than the malawi assets; so
enforcement may involve enforcement of security over the assets of lynas and its material subsidiaries, including appointing a receiver.
the future principal repayments due prior to maturity under the jare loan facility as at june 30, 2015 were as follows:

repayment date                                                              repayment amount

30 september 2015                                                                      usd30m
21 december 2015                                                                       usd20m
31 march 2016                                                                          usd20m

as detailed in the subsequent events note, the above repayment schedule has now been amended to the following:

repayment date                                                              repayment amount

30 june 2016                                                                            usd2m

21 december 2017                                                                       usd30m
30 june 2018                                                                         usd153m


during the current year, the principal repayment due on september 30, 2014 in respect of the jare facility was paid by its due date.
in addition, the principal amount of the mt kellett convertible bonds is us$225 million. unless the convertible bonds are converted into
ordinary shares in lynas prior to maturity, the principal amount of us$225 million was originally due for repayment on july 25, 2016. as
detailed in the subsequent events note, that repayment date has now been extended to september 30, 2018.
in the event of repayment default, lynas may be required to seek amendments and/or waivers of covenant compliance or alternative funding
arrangements such as a refinance. there is no assurance that lynas’ lenders would consent to such an amendment or waiver in the event of
non-compliance, or that such consent would not be conditioned upon the receipt of a cash payment, revised payout terms, increased interest
rates, or restrictions on the expansion of debt facilities in the foreseeable future, or that its lenders would not exercise rights that would be
available to them, including among other things, accelerating repayment of outstanding borrowings, or appointing a receiver.
in the event significant uncertainty arises in relation to lynas’ ability to fully repay, refinance or reschedule the outstanding balances of the
jare loan facility and the mt kellett convertible bonds by their respective maturity dates in mid-2018, the group’s ability to continue as a
going concern may also be affected.

regulatory and title risk
changes in legislative and administrative regimes, taxation laws, interest rates, other legal and government policies in australia and malaysia
may have an adverse effect on the assets, operations and ultimately the financial performance of lynas and the market price of lynas shares.
lynas’ mining and production activities are dependent on the granting and maintenance of appropriate licences, permits and regulatory
consents and authorisations (including those related to interests in mining tenements and those related to the operation of the lynas plants
in australia and malaysia), which may not be granted or may be withdrawn or be made subject to limitations at the discretion of government
or regulatory authorities.. although such licences, permits and regulatory consents and authorisations may be granted, continued or renewed
(as the case may be), there can be no assurance that such licences, permits and regulatory consents and authorisations will be granted,
continued or renewed, or as to the terms of renewals or grants. if there is a failure to obtain or retain the appropriate licences, permits and
regulatory consents and authorisations or there is a material delay in obtaining or renewing them or they are granted subject to onerous
conditions or withdrawn, then lynas’ ability to conduct its mining and production activities may be adversely affected. as noted in the



lynas corporation limited | 2015 annual report                                                                                                      15

corporate government statement continued




quarterly report released on july 17, 2015, one court challenge remains to the original temporary operating licence for the lamp.
a decision in respect of that challenge is expected later in 2015.

interest rates
lynas is exposed to some interest rate risk on its borrowings. the interest rate on the jare facility can vary in certain circumstances, as
detailed in note 28 to the financial statements. fluctuation in interest rates would have an impact on the company’s earnings.

health, safety and environment
lynas is subject to regulation in respect of the health and safety of our people and the protection and rehabilitation of our environment...
health, safety and the environment is a key focus area and lynas is committed to provide and maintain a healthy and safe work environment
and to comply with all relevant environmental legislation and other relevant requirements. given the sensitive nature of this area, lynas may
be exposed to litigation, foreseen and unforeseen compliance and rehabilitation costs despite its best efforts.



statement of compliance
the financial report is based on the guidelines in the group 100 incorporated publication guide to the review of operations and financial
condition.



significant changes in the state of affairs
except as disclosed in the review of operations and subsequent events, there have been no significant changes in the state of affairs of the
group during the current financial year.



environmental regulation and performance
the group is bound by the requirements and guidelines of the relevant environmental protection authorities for the management and
rehabilitation of mining tenements owned or previously owned by the group. mining tenements are being maintained and rehabilitated
following these guidelines. there have been no known breaches of any of these conditions.



corporate governance statement
the board of directors of the company is responsible for the corporate governance of the group. the board guides and monitors the business
and affairs of the group on behalf of the shareholders by whom they are elected and to whom they are accountable. the board has approved
this corporate governance statement. this corporate governance statement is current on the date that the directors’ report is signed in

recommendations on an exception basis, whereby disclosure is required of any recommendations that have not been adopted by the group,
together with the reasons why they have not been adopted. the group’s corporate governance principles and policies are therefore structured

remuneration and community committee concludes that it would be appropriate to consider the appointment of an additional director, an
extensive process is undertaken to identify suitable candidates, usually involving an external search firm. that process will involve identifying
the skills and experience required of the candidate, compiling lists of potential candidates, identifying a short list of candidates to be
interviewed, conducting interviews, obtaining and checking information in relation to the character, experience, education, criminal record
and bankruptcy history of the short listed candidates, and selecting a recommended candidate.

     (1) advising the board and its committees on governance matters;
     (2) monitoring that board and committee policy and procedures are followed;
     (3) coordinating the timely completion and despatch of board and committee papers;
     (4) ensuring accurate minutes are taken of board and committee meetings; and
     (5) helping to organize and facilitate the induction and professional development of directors.

recommendation 1.5 – diversity
the group has established a policy concerning diversity. the group recognises the need to set diversity measures in each of its operating
locations taking into account the differing diversity issues within each geographic location in which it operates. a copy of the ‘diversity policy’
is available from the group’s website, www.lynascorp.com. the policy includes requirements for the board to establish measurable objectives
for achieving gender diversity and for the board to assess annually both the objectives and progress in achieving them.
below are the measurable objectives set by the board for achieving gender diversity together with the progress made in achieving those
objectives:
     (1) ensuring that recruitment of employees and directors is made from a diverse pool of qualified candidates. where appropriate, a
         professional recruitment firm shall be engaged to select a diverse range of suitably qualified candidates.
     	the group continues to ensure that professional recruitment firms provide a broad selection of suitably qualified candidates
         together with prioritising local employment in the areas in which it operates.
     (2) ensuring that there are appropriate proportions of women or other groups of individuals within areas of the group.
     	the group recognises that further work can be done to ensure that there are appropriate proportions of women and other groups
         of individuals. the group believes that its current diversity levels are good compared to other companies in its industry. the group’s
         policies of favouring local employment and promoting education in its local communities will continue to contribute to the
         diversity of its workforce.
     (3) identifying programmes that assist in the development of a broader pool of skilled and experienced candidates including:
         (a) initiatives focused on skills development, such as executive mentoring programmes; and
         (b) career advancement programmes to develop skills and experience that prepare employees for senior management and board
               positions.
          the group has in place a formal talent management process including mentoring and succession planning.
     (4) taking action to correct inappropriate workplace behaviour and behaviour that is inconsistent with the diversity objectives of the
         group.
          the group has in place a code of conduct as well as an harassment & discrimination policy which defines inappropriate behaviour
          and the potential resultant disciplinary actions. a formal employee grievance process has been established to assist in identifying
          issues such as inappropriate workplace behaviour and behaviour that is inconsistent with the values and diversity objectives of the
          group.
the group provides the following statistics on gender diversity as at june 30, 2015 (prior year: june 26, 2014):
    (1) proportion of women employees in the whole organisation: 11.7% (2014 – 16.8%). proportion of women employees in australia:
         16% (2014 – 34.3%).
    (2) proportion of women employees in senior executive positions in the whole organisation: 33.0% (2014 – 35.3%).
    (3) proportion of women on the board: 33% (2014 – 40%).

the group defines “senior executive positions” as members in the leadership team who have the authority and responsibility for planning,
directing and controlling major activities of the group.
the group is not a “relevant employer” under the workplace gender equality act, because the group had less than 80 employees in australia
for more than 6 months of the year ending june 30, 2015.

recommendation 1.6 – process for evaluating the performance of the board
in accordance with the charter of the nomination, remuneration and community committee, the committee is responsible for the:
     (1) evaluation and review of the performance of the board against both measurable and qualitative indicators established by the
          committee;
     (2) evaluation and review of the performance of individual directors against both measurable and qualitative indicators established by
          the committee;
     (3) review of and making of recommendations on the size and structure of the board; and
     (4) review of the effectiveness and programme of board meetings.

recommendation 1.7 – performance evaluation of senior executives
the group has established detailed written key responsibility areas and key performance indicators (kpis) for each senior executive.
the performance of senior executives is periodically reviewed against their kpis, at least once every 12 months, as part of the group’s
formal performance review procedures. the group has adopted a formal procedure whereby each senior executive meets with his/her
direct supervisor to review performance against kpi’s during the review period. the results of that review are recorded in writing for follow
up during subsequent meetings, and for internal reporting purposes.
induction procedures are in place to allow new senior executives to participate fully and actively in management decision making at the
earliest opportunity.
an evaluation of senior executives took place during the financial year. the evaluation was in accordance with the above process.


principle 2 – structure the board to add value
recommendation 2.1 – nomination committee
the group has established a nomination, remuneration and community committee.
the group’s nomination, remuneration and community committee complies with each of the requirements of recommendation 2.1 as follows:
    (1) the committee consists of a majority of independent directors. during the financial year ending june 30, 2015, the members of
         the committee were ms conlon, mr forde and mr curtis (until february 1, 2015) and mr harding (from february 1, 2015).
    (2) the committee is chaired by ms conlon, who is an independent director and who is not chair of the board.
    (3) there were three formal meetings of the committee during the financial year ending june 30, 2015. in addition, there were several
         informal meetings. further details, including the attendances of members, are provided in the directors meetings section of the
         directors’ report.
    (4) at all times during the financial year ending june 30, 2015, the committee had three members.

the group has adopted charters for its nomination, remuneration and community committee. copies of the committee charters are
available from the group’s website, www.lynascorp.com.

recommendation 2.2 – board skills
the nomination, remuneration and community committee recognizes that it is important that the board has an appropriate mix of skills,
experience, expertise and diversity. the board considers it important for the following skills and experience to be represented:
   •• experience as a chief executive;
   •• international business experience;
   •• financial and accounting experience;
   •• operational experience in the chemical and resources industries
   •• strategy and strategic marketing experience
   •• corporate governance and risk management experience.

information about the diversity of the board is set out under recommendation 1.5 above.

recommendation 2.3 – independence of directors
the council defines independence as being free from any interest, position, association or relationship that might influence, or could
reasonably be perceived to influence, in a material respect his or her capacity to bring an independent judgement to bear on issues before the
board and to act in the best interests of the group and its shareholders generally.
during the financial year ended june 30, 2015, the board had a majority of independent directors. in accordance with the definition of
independence above, and the materiality thresholds set, j. klein, w. forde, k. conlon and m harding (since january 1, 2015) and p. etienne
(since january 1, 2015), were viewed as independent directors. during the financial year ending june 30, 2012, mr forde acted as chairman
of the lampson board, which had oversight of the construction of phase 1 of the rare earths project, and received consultancy fees for those
services. as construction of phase 1 of the rare earths project has been completed, mr forde has not provided any consultancy services to the
group since june 30, 2012. the board does not view this historical consultancy arrangement as interfering with the exercise of unfettered and
independent judgement. this historical consultancy arrangement was for approximately 12 months, and it was not material. as chairman of
the lampson board, mr forde acted as the lynas board representative in the supervisory board for the construction of phase 1 of the rare
earths project, and this role was an extension of his role as a non-executive director.
n. curtis was the non-executive chairman until january 1, 2015, and a non-executive director until february 1, 2015. as mr curtis was
employed as the chief executive officer of the group up until march 31, 2013, mr curtis was not an independent director of the group in
accordance with the definition above.
a. lacaze’s appointment as chief executive officer of the group was effective from june 25, 2014 (previously, a non-executive director from
january 1, 2014). as the chief executive officer of the group, ms lacaze is not an independent director of the group in accordance with the
definition above.

the length of service of each director who held office as at june 30, 2015 is as follows:

name                                                 term in office

j. klein                                                  10 years
w. forde                                         7 years 5 months
k. conlon                                         3 year 8 months
a. lacaze                                         1 year 6 months
m. harding                                               6 months
p. etienne                                               6 months

recommendation 2.4 – majority of independent directors
as noted above in relation to recommendation 2.3, at all times during the financial year ended june 30, 2015, the board had a majority of
independent directors.

recommendation 2.5 – the chair should be an independent director and not the same person as the ceo
until january 1, 2015, n. curtis was the chairman of the group.. as mr curtis was employed as the chief executive officer of the group up
until march 31, 2013, mr curtis was not an independent director of the group in accordance with the council’s definition of independence.
the role of mr curtis as chairman until january 1, 2015 was balanced by the presence of a clear majority of independent directors on the
board. in addition mr forde, who is an independent non-executive director, acted as the deputy chairman of the board during mr curtis’
tenure. the role of the deputy chairman includes chairing meetings of the board on matters where the chairman is unable to act in that
capacity, for example due to a lack of independence.
since january 1, 2015, m. harding has been the chairman of the board. mr harding is an independent director and he is not the ceo.
accordingly, the group has been fully compliant with recommendation 2.5 since january 1, 2015.

recommendation 2.6 – director induction and professional development
the group has adopted a board induction policy that summarizes the key matters to be addressed in the induction of each new director.
among other things, the induction policy deals with information to be provided to new directors, the chair’s role, key contacts, remuneration,
indemnities, insurance, access to information, and disclosure.

non-audit services
during the year ernst & young, the group’s auditor, has performed certain other services in addition to the audit and review of the financial
statements.
details of amounts paid or payable to the auditor for non-audit services provided during the year are outlined in note 11 of the ‘notes to
the financial statements’. the directors have considered the non-audit services provided during the year by the auditor are satisfied that the
provision of non-audit services by the auditor during the year is compatible, and did not compromise, the auditor independence requirements
of the corporations act 2001 for the following reasons:
     (a) all non-audit services were subject to the corporate governance procedures adopted by the group and have been reviewed by the
           audit committee to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and
     (b) the non-audit services provided do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in apes
           110 code of ethics for professional accountants, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor’s own work, acting in a
           management or decision making capacity for the group, acting as an advocate for the group or jointly sharing risks and rewards.

directors’ report




remuneration report – audited
year ended 30 june 2015



dear shareholder,
i am pleased to present our remuneration report for the year ended june 30, 2015 (fy15).
as with other areas of the business, we have fundamentally restructured the executive team and executive remuneration in fy15.
fy15 was our first full financial year with amanda lacaze in the role of chief executive officer and managing director.
in addition, in fy15, we substantially restructured the board, welcoming mike harding and philippe etienne to the board.
remuneration has been simplified and reduced. total remuneration for the continuing directors and executives in fy15 is shown in the
table on page 34.
the incentive structure has also been simplified. payments have been made only where specific objectives that underpin improved
performance have been delivered. these have included:
   •• improved production
   •• achievement of significant cost reductions
   •• excellent cash management
   •• implementation of new strategies to manage residues from both the mining and manufacturing operations
   •• completion of new debt agreements

in fy15, the only remuneration paid to non-executive directors was fees (i.e. no options or similar benefits were issued).
we hope that the report will assist your understanding of our remuneration objectives and policies. we welcome your feedback on how
we can further improve the remuneration report in the future.
yours sincerely,




kathleen conlon

directors’ report
remuneration report – audited continued




this report sets out the remuneration arrangements of directors and kmp of the group in accordance with the corporations act 2001 and its
regulations.



a.         explanation of key terms
the following table explains some key terms used in this report:

employee share             options and performance rights that are issued for the benefit of selected executives are issued for market value
trust (“est”)              to the lynas est. at the same time, the est makes an advance to the executive equivalent to the value of the
                           options and/or performance rights to enable the executive to subscribe for an equivalent number of units in the
                           est. there is no net cash impact for the group arising from those arrangements.

executives                 at as june 30, 2015 year end, the chief executive officer and managing director (“ceo”), the chief financial
                           officer (“cfo”), the vp production, the vp malaysia and the general counsel and company secretary.

key management             those people who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the major activities of
personnel (“kmp”)          the group, directly or indirectly, including the directors (whether executive or otherwise) and the executives.

lynas advanced             the lamp, which is located in the state of pahang, malaysia, is the facility for the cracking and separation of
materials plant            concentrate into separated rare earths products.
(“lamp”)

long term                  lti is the long term incentive component of total remuneration. lti usually comprises options or performance
incentive (“lti”)          rights with a three year vesting period that are subject to specified vesting conditions. further details of the
                           vesting conditions are in section d. options and performance rights cannot be exercised unless the vesting
                           conditions are satisfied.

option                     an option is a right to purchase a share in the future, subject to the relevant executive paying an exercise price.
                           options are issued for the benefit of selected executives as part of their lti remuneration. the exercise price is
                           usually set at a premium to the volume weighted average price of the shares on the asx over the five days prior to
                           the date of offer of the options.

performance right          a performance right is similar to an option, except that no “exercise price” is payable when a performance right is
                           exercised.

short term                 sti is the short term incentive component of total remuneration. an sti could be in the form of cash or equity and
incentive (“sti”)          it is only received by the executive if specified goals are achieved.

b. our remuneration philosophy
the group’s objective is to provide maximum stakeholder benefit by attracting, retaining and motivating a high quality board of directors
and executive management team. remunerating directors and executives fairly and appropriately, consistent with relevant employment
market conditions, is an important part of achieving this goal. we align rewards to sustainable value through creating links between the
achievement of organisational goals, both long and short term in nature, with the non-fixed elements of individual remuneration.
to help the group achieve this objective, the committee links the nature and amount of the remuneration paid to the executives to the
group’s financial and operational performance.
total remuneration (that is, fixed remuneration plus sti and lti) is paid at market rates except in exceptional cases where skills are scarce or
particularly valuable, in which case we pay as necessary. our market is defined by location and function, i.e. malaysia, wa resources and the
global rare earths market.
sti awards, which create an “at risk” component are equal to approximately 50% of total fixed remuneration for senior executives (with 25%
paid in cash and 25% paid in performance rights).
lti awards for senior executives with tsr and operating milestone performance hurdles equal to approximately 25% of total fixed remunera-
tion for senior executives, and 50% of total fixed remuneration for the chief executive officer.

external advisors and remuneration advice
the committee engages external advisors to provide advice and market related information as required.
   •• during the year, the committee did not receive any remuneration recommendations (as defined in the corporations act 2001).



c. role of the nomination, remuneration and community committee
the board is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for directors and executives. the committee assesses,
on a regular basis, the appropriateness of the nature and amount of kmp remuneration. in fulfilling these duties and to support effective
governance processes, the committee:
   •• consists of a majority of independent non-executive directors and is chaired by an independent chair;
   •• has unrestricted access to management and any relevant documents; and
   •• engages external advisers for assistance to the extent appropriate and necessary (e.g. detailing market levels of remuneration).

d.      our executive remuneration framework
objective
the group aims to remunerate its executives at a level commensurate with their position and responsibilities within the group so as to:
   •• reward them for the group, business unit and individual performance against agreed targets set by reference to appropriate
      benchmarks;
   •• align their interests with those of our shareholders;
   •• link their reward with the group’s strategic goals and performance; and
   •• provide total remuneration that is competitive by market standards.

structure
executive remuneration consists of the following key elements:
   •• fixed pay (base salary and superannuation); and
   •• variable remuneration, being:
      •• sti; and
       •• lti.

the group provides no retirement benefits, other than statutory superannuation.

fixed pay
fixed pay consists of base salary and superannuation. it is determined on an individual basis, taking into account external market benchmarks
and individual factors such as capability, experience, responsibility and accountability. fixed pay is targeted at market rates in the geographic
and functional markets in which we operate.

variable remuneration
notwithstanding the introduction of a formal sti plan, the board retains ultimate discretion in relation to the payment of bonuses, options,
performance rights and other incentive payments, based on the overall performance of the group and of the individual during the year.
in summary:


                 fixed pay                              variable remuneration
                 = base + super                         = sti (cash and deferred) + lti



stis
prior to june 30, 2012 the board had a discretionary sti policy used to reward exceptional performance. however, with effect from july
1, 2012, the board decided that a move towards a formalised sti policy was appropriate. the introduction of a formal sti plan resulted
in an adjustment of remuneration mix of fixed pay and variable remuneration, rather than an increase in total remuneration received by
executives.
our target sti for executives is 50% of fixed pay.
the goals and measures of the sti programme (including individual, team and company performance goals and measures), the relative
weightings of those measures and goals, and sti target amounts are determined and approved at the commencement of each review period by
the remuneration committee. during the financial year ended june 30, 2015, the measures were drafted with reference to the following goals:
   •• corporate: operating cashflow, operating margin
   •• team: health & safety of employees, raw water consumption, yield, smp and recovery
   •• individual: performance rating

the payment of any award under the sti programme is subject to the group achieving operating cashflow that is at or better than budgeted
operating cashflow (“sti gateway”). the sti gateway was not satisfied during the financial year ended june 30, 2015. the below table shows
which of the individual sti goals were achieved during the financial year ended june 30, 2015:

ex gratia award at the end of fy15
notwithstanding that the sti gateway for fy15 was not satisfied, the board concluded after the end of fy15 that it was appropriate to make
an ex gratia award to selected senior executives, in recognition of recent achievements and as part of the group’s retention policies.
in approving the awards, the executives’ contributions to the following key performance areas were assessed.
     (a) improved production rates
     (b) decreased costs
     (c) cash performance
     (d) the debt rescheduling

recognizing the importance of cash conservation, the award to senior executives was approved as an award of performance rights. the award
is in an amount equal to approximately 15% of total fixed remuneration.
the performance rights will vest after 1 year of service with no other vesting conditions. the performance rights will be valued based on the
5 day vwap at the date of the board’s decision to approve the award, being july 28, 2015.

ltis
options and performance rights are provided to kmp and other selected employees to provide greater alignment to strategic business
objectives. they have three year vesting periods, and are exercisable between three and five years after they were granted provided the
award recipient is still employed with the group (unless this requirement, in limited circumstances, is waived by the board), and any relevant
performance conditions are achieved.
a summary of the performance conditions attached to options and performance rights granted during the financial year ended june 30,
2015 (in addition to the requirement that the award recipient is still employed by the group at the end of a three year vesting period) is set
out below:
     (i) 50% will be conditional on satisfaction of the following operational hurdle:
            consistency of production – right first time (rft): during the calendar year 2016, the percentage of first time conforming
            produced tonnes over total produced tonnes for mt weld and the lamp must be at least 85% in accordance with the following
            sliding scale:
            (a) if the rft is 85% or more, and less than 90%, then 50% of the rft portion will vest.
            (b) if the rft is 90% or more, and less than 92%, then 100% of the rft portion will vest.
            (c) if the rft is 92% or more, then an additional 20% of the rft portion will vest, giving a total vested portion equal to 120%
                of the rft portion.
     (ii)   50% will be conditional on the company’s total shareholder return (tsr) being at least at the 51st percentile of asx 200
            companies calculated over the 3-year vesting period, in accordance with the following sliding scale:
            (a) if the lynas tsr is at least at the 51st percentile, 50% of the tsr portion will vest.
            (b) if the lynas tsr is at least at the 76th percentile, 100% of the tsr portion will vest.
            (c) if the lynas tsr is between the 51st percentile and the 76th percentile, a pro rata amount of between 50% and 100% of the
                tsr portion will vest (with the relevant percentile being rounded up or down to the nearest 5%, for ease of calculation).

in accordance with the group’s policy governing the trading of the company’s shares by directors and employees, award recipients are not
permitted to hedge their options or performance rights before they vest.

clawback policy
in circumstances where the group becomes aware of any material misstatement in its financial statements due to: (i) non-compliance with a
financial reporting requirement; (ii) the kmp’s misconduct; or (iii) the misconduct of any other lynas personnel under the supervision of the
relevant kmp, the board has authority under the clawback policy to:
      (a) require a kmp to repay some or all of any sti award or lti award granted to the kmp from july 1, 2013 (“relevant award”), to the
           extent such award has vested;
      (b) forfeit the reference units representing all or a part of the kmp’s relevant award, to the extent such award remains unvested; or
      (c) withhold the payment or allocation of all or a part of the kmp’s relevant award, to the extent such award has not been paid or
           given to that kmp.


e. service agreements
the ceo and managing director has signed an executive services agreement containing reasonable commercial conditions. subject to the
following provisions, the agreement is for an indefinite duration. the key provisions of the agreement are:

 notice by ceo:             ms lacaze must give three months’ written notice of an intention to resign.

 notice by group:           the group may terminate the agreement by giving six months’ written notice.
                            the group may terminate ms lacaze’s employment at any time without notice if serious misconduct has
                            occurred.

 treatment of               on resignation, any unvested options and performance rights may be forfeited subject to the discretion of
 incentives on              the board. upon termination of ms lacaze’s employment by the group other than as a result of misconduct,
 termination:               ms lacaze will be entitled to retain a pro – rata portion of any unvested options and performance rights held
                            by her on the date of termination. for example, where 50% of the vesting period has been served, ms lacaze
                            will be entitled to retain 50% of the unvested options or performance rights. ms lacaze will also be entitled
                            to retain any options or performance rights that have vested prior to the date of termination.

 termination                in accordance with the corporations act 2001, the maximum termination payment payable to ms lacaze is equal
 benefits:                  to her base salary for one year (i.e. excluding any lti component).

employment conditions for all other kmps are on the following terms:
  •• each may give three month’s written notice of their intention to resign;
  •• the group may terminate the employment by providing three to six months’ written notice;
  •• on resignation or termination (other than as a result of misconduct), unvested incentives will be treated in the same manner set out
     above in respect of ms lacaze; and
  •• the group may terminate employment at any time without notice if serious misconduct has occurred.



f.       linking remuneration and group performance
prior to the financial year ended june 30, 2011, kmp remuneration (including any component that consisted of securities in the group) was
not formally linked to group performance. the reason behind this approach was that as the group was in a development phase it was not
appropriate to link remuneration to factors such as profitability or share price. this approach has changed now that the group is transitioning
into its operational phase.
     •• in the financial year ended june 30, 2011, 50% of the lti grant was subject to the achievement of a net positive operating cash flow
        hurdle for the six months ending december 31, 2012. that hurdle was not satisfied.
     •• in the financial year ended june 30, 2012, lti grants were subject to a tsr hurdle and to project milestone hurdles related to reo
        capacity. those hurdles were not satisfied.
     •• in the financial year ended june 30, 2013, lti grants were also subject to a tsr hurdle and to project milestone hurdles related to reo
        capacity. the project milestone hurdles were not satisfied. the reference period for the tsr hurdle has not yet expired.
     •• in the financial year ended june 30, 2014, lti grants were also subject to a tsr hurdle and to project milestone hurdles related to
        consistency of production – right first time. the reference period for these hurdles has not yet expired.
     •• in the financial year ended june 30, 2015, lti grants were also subject to a tsr hurdle and to project milestone hurdles related to
        consistency of production – right first time, as detailed in section d above. the reference period for these hurdles has not yet expired.

individual performance reviews link total remuneration to individual and business unit performance. from july 1, 2012 the mix of fixed pay
and variable remuneration has been adjusted by the introduction of a formal sti plan. the introduction of the sti plan reflects the transition
of the group from a development phase to an operational phase, and it recognises that we have important short term goals based on
successful commissioning and ramp-up, production volumes, cash flow, costs and safety and community programmes. the sti component is
intended to be in substitution for (and not in addition to) portions of remuneration that were previously paid predominantly as lti.

during the financial year ended june 30, 2015, the sti plan consisted of one single 12-month review period, commencing on july 1, 2014.
as noted above in section d, the payment of any award under the sti programme is subject to the group achieving positive operating cash
flow (“sti gateway”). the sti gateway was not satisfied.
separately, changes in the share based remuneration from one year to the next reflect the impact of amortising the accounting value of
options and performance rights over their three year vesting period and the impact of forfeitures which can relate to both the current and
prior periods in a given fiscal period. in certain periods, a negative value may be presented which results when the forfeitures recognised in a
period are greater than the accounting amortisation expense for the current portion of the vesting period.
for further context the following table provides reported financial information on which remuneration has been based. as noted elsewhere
the group has moved from a development phase and is now transitioning into its operational phase, as evident in the revenue metrics noted
below.

g. non-executive director remuneration
objective
remuneration of non-executive directors (“neds”) is set at a level that enables the group to attract and retain talented and motivated
people at a cost which is acceptable to shareholders. in setting remuneration, the group takes into account, among other factors:
   ••   fees paid to neds of companies of a similar size/industry;
   ••   the time commitment required for neds to properly fulfil their duties;
   ••   the risks and responsibilities associated with the roles; and
   ••   the relevant commercial and industry experience required.

structure
the company’s constitution and the asx listing rules specify that the maximum aggregate remuneration of neds must be determined from
time to time by a general meeting. the last determination was at the agm held on november 20, 2012, and an aggregate pool of $1,250,000
was approved. the aggregate fees for neds for the period did not exceed this amount.

components of non-executive director remuneration
each ned receives a fee for being a director of the company, and (other than the chairman of the board) each ned receives a fee for each
committee of which they are members. the ned fees, including committee fees, include statutory superannuation contributions where
appropriate.

base fees
base fees for neds for the financial year ended june 30, 2015 were:
   •• chairman $250,000 per annum;
   •• non-executive director $100,000 per annum.

committee fees

audit, risk management, safety, health and environment committee                                                  30,000                15,000

no dividends have been paid in the past and so it is not appropriate to estimate future possible dividends in arriving at the fair values. the
life of the options is based on either a three-year expiry or a five-year expiry from date of grant (as specified above) and is therefore not
necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
the resulting weighted average fair values for those options and performance rights granted during the year are:

subsequent events
on august 17, 2015 the company announced it had agreed on a long term debt structure with its current debt providers and bondholders.

japan australia rare earths b.v. (jare) loan facility
the new maturity date of this facility is june 30, 2018. interest is paid into a restricted bank account in the name of lynas. interest liabilities
will only be paid to the lenders to the extent that, from june 30, 2016 onwards, there is a total cash balance (unrestricted and restricted
funds) in excess of aud60m. the balance in the restricted accounts is available, at the lenders’ discretion, for reuse in the lynas business.
the company has agreed an interest regime which provides lynas with the ability to reduce the effective interest rate on the jare facility
from 7% per annum to a floor of 2.8% per annum over time. the initial interest rate is unchanged at 7% per annum, however the new
framework sets specific targets that, if met, will effect a cascading decrease in the interest rate payable on the facility.
the principal repayments due prior to maturity under the jare facility have been adjusted significantly.

directors’ report




under the new agreement, lynas has the ability to reduce the effective interest rate on the jare facility from 7% to a minimum floor of
2.8% over time. this is based on meeting certain milestones as shown below.

production target

                                                                              interest reduction when               interest penalty when

december 31, 2015                   1,860 tonnes                                        0.5%                                 0.25%
june 30, 2016                       3,840 tonnes                                        0.5%                                   nil

june 30, 2017                       8,040 tonnes                                        0.25%                                0.25%

if the target of 3,840 tonnes is not met by june 30, 2016, lynas agrees to start up sx5 train 4 production. lynas is continuously assessing the
appropriate time to start up sx5 train 4 which is largely dependent on market conditions.

scheduled repayments
each time a scheduled repayment is fully paid on or before its scheduled repayment date, the interest rate decreases by 0.3% per annum
effective from the day after the repayment is made.

principal prepayments
if, at any time on or before 21 december 2016, the total repayment and prepayment amount (including the usd20m already repaid by
october 2, 2014) is equal to or greater than usd50m, the interest rate decreases by 1.0%. an additional 0.5% reduction applies if, at any
time on or before june 30, 2017, the total repayment and prepayment amount (including the usd20m already repaid by october 2, 2014) is
equal to or greater than usd70m. in the alternative, if, at any time on or before 30 june 2017, the total repayment and prepayment amount
(including the usd20m already repaid by october 2, 2014) is equal to or greater than usd50m, the interest rate decreases by 0.4%.
the previous “phase 2 completion test” and any potential requirement for early repayments arising from that test are deleted.

mt kellett convertible bonds
the maturity of the bonds has been extended from july 25, 2016 to september 30, 2018.
the interest coupon on the bondholder facility remains at 2.75% for the duration of the loan. the interest payment dates are set at june
30, and december 31 each year. interest payable on the bonds in respect of the interest periods ending march 31, june 30, september 30,
december 31, 2015 and march 31 ,2016 are deferred until june 30, 2016 without penalty.
the convertible bond facility contains the same mechanism as the jare facility for payment of interest into restricted bank accounts in the
name of lynas. interest liabilities will only be paid to the lenders to the extent that there is a total cash balance (unrestricted and restricted
funds) in excess of aud60m after june 30, 2016. the balance in the restricted accounts is available, at the lenders’ discretion, for reuse in the
lynas business.
as part of the agreement, the company has issued warrants to bondholders for 174,365,466 shares at a strike price of $0.038 per share.
these warrants will expire on september 30, 2018.
with the exception of the above, there have been no other events subsequent to june 30, 2015 that would require accrual or disclosure in
this financial report.
the directors’ report is signed in accordance with a resolution of directors made pursuant to s.298 (2) of the corporations act 2001.

the year’s end or from time to time during the financial year.


directors’ responsibility for the financial report
the directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with
australian accounting standards and the corporations act 2001 and for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to
enable the preparation of the financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. in note 2, the directors
also state, in accordance with accounting standard aasb 101 presentation of financial statements, that the financial statements comply
with international financial reporting standards.


auditor’s responsibility
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with australian
auditing standards. those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial report. the procedures
selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether
due to fraud or error.
in making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal controls. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
report.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 30 june 2015




1. reporting entity
lynas corporation limited (the “company”) is a for-profit company domiciled and incorporated in australia.
the financial report of lynas corporation limited as at and for the year ended june 30, 2015 comprises the company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the “group”).
the group is principally engaged in the extraction and processing of rare earth minerals, primarily in australia and malaysia.
the address of the registered office of the company is level 1, 7 tully road, east perth wa 6004, australia.



2. basis of presentation
2.1 statement of compliance
the financial report is a general purpose financial report and has been prepared in accordance with australian accounting standards (“aasbs”)
adopted by the australian accounting standards board (“aasb”) and the corporations act 2001.
the financial report also complies with international financial reporting standards and interpretations (“ifrs”) as issued by the international
accounting standards board (“iasb”).the financial report was approved by the board of directors (the “directors”) on september 21, 2015.


2.2 going concern
the financial report has been prepared using the going concern assumption.
the board has reached the view that this is appropriate after considering a number of key factors affecting the business. these include the
continuing extremely low prices for rare earths products experienced in the first quarter of fy16 and the possibility that these low prices
could continue through fy16, continuing improvements in cost performance and the recently announced restructuring of the company’s
debt facilities.
at june 30, 2015 the group has net current liabilities of $207.4m, primarily arising due to the scheduled repayment of debt falling due in the
following 12-month period. whilst this reflected the position at june 30, 2015, the effect of the subsequent refinancing of debt post year end
as outlined below means that at the time these financial statements were approved, the group had net current assets.
the directors have prepared a cashflow forecast which indicates that the group will have sufficient cashflows to meet all commitments
and working capital requirements for the 12-month period from the date of signing this report. the group’s operations have demonstrated
the ability to generate net positive cash inflows. it is the intention of the directors to finance future operations solely with cashflows from
operating activities considering its update on borrowings below.

borrowings
full details of the group’s material debt facilities are set out in note 24 borrowings and include both the jare loan facility and the mt kellett
convertible bonds.
as set out in that note 24 borrowings and note 37 subsequent events, the company have reached amended agreements on its long term debt
structure with its debt providers. the maturity dates of the jare loan facility and the mt kellett convertible bond have been extended to 2018.
an amended principal repayment schedule for the jare loan facility under the amended agreement is set out in that note. the table
illustrates how repayments required have been adjusted significantly in favour of the company.


2.3 basis of measurement
the financial report has been prepared under the historical cost convention except certain components of inventory which are measured at
net realisable value, derivatives and certain available for sale financial assets (being listed securities) which are measured at fair value and
certain non-current assets that are presented on a revalued amount. the methods used to measure fair values are discussed further in note 5.
information as disclosed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash flows for the current year is for the 12 month period ended june 30, 2015. information for the comparative
year is for the 12 month period ended june 30, 2014.

2.4 presentation currency
the financial report of the company and the group is presented in australian dollars (“aud”), which is both the company’s and the group’s
presentation currency.


2.5 rounding of amounts
the company is of a kind referred to in class order 98/100, issued by the australian securities and investments commission, in relation to the
“rounding off” of amounts. amounts in the financial report have been rounded off in accordance with the class order relief to the nearest
thousand dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.


2.6 use of estimates and judgements
the preparation of the financial report requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates. these estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
year or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both the current and future years.
information about the significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most
material effect on the amounts recognised in the financial report are described in note 4.


2.7 reclassification of comparative information
certain elements of the information presented for comparative purposes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.



3. summary of significant accounting policies
the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in this financial report and have been applied
consistently by all group entities.


3.1 basis of consolidation
(a) subsidiaries
subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company or the group. control is achieved when the company or group has power over the
investee, is exposed, or has the rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and has the ability to use its power to affect
its returns. in assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable are taken into account. the financial statements of
subsidiaries are included in the financial report from the date control (or effective control) commences until the date that control ceases. as
per note 30 all entities within the group are 100% owned and controlled.
the group has adopted aasb 3 business combinations (2008) and aasb 127 consolidated and separate financial statement (2008) under
which the acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses by the group. the cost of an
acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of the
acquisition, including the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based payment awards (as measured in accordance with aasb
2 share based payment) of the acquiree that are mandatorily replaced as a result of the transaction. transaction costs that the group incurs
in connection with an acquisition are expensed as incurred. identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in
a business combination are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests.
non-controlling interests are initially recognised at their proportionate share of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
during the measurement year an acquirer can report provisional information for a business combination if by the end of the reporting year
in which the combination occurs the accounting is incomplete. the measurement year, however, ends at the earlier of when the acquirer has
received all of the necessary information to determine the fair values or one year from the date of the acquisition.

(b) transactions eliminated on consolidation
intra-group balances and unrealised items of income and expense arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the
financial report. unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the group’s
interest in the investee. unrealised losses are eliminated in the same manner as gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of
impairment.


3.2 foreign currency
(a) functional and presentation currency
items included in the financial report of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment
in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”).



lynas corporation limited | 2015 annual report                                                                                                  51

financial statements
notes to the financial statements continued




3. summary of significant accounting policies continued

(b) foreign currency transactions
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency of the
respective entities at the exchange rate at that date. non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are meas-
ured at historical cost are translated to the functional currency of the respective entities at the date of the transaction. non-monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency of the respective
entities at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined.
foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss.

(c)    foreign operations
the results and financial position of those entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of the group are
translated into the group’s presentation currency as follows:
   •• assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date of the
       statement of financial position;
   •• income and expense items for each profit or loss item are translated at average exchange rates;
   •• items of other comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates; and
   •• all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.

(d) changes in functional currency
any change in a group company’s functional currency is applied prospectively from the date of the change. all items are translated into the
new functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the change. the resultant translated amounts for non-monetary items are
thereafter treated as their historical cost.
following the issue of the mt kellett convertible bonds, the primary economic environment in which the company operates was changed.
management performed a functional currency review and concluded that the functional currency of the company should change prospectively
to the united states dollar (“usd”), effective as of january 24, 2012. prior to this date the functional currency of the company was aud.


3.3 non-derivative financial instruments
non-derivative financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, receivables, available for sale financial assets, trade and other
payables, interest bearing borrowings and compound instruments.
a non-derivative financial instrument is recognised if the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
non-derivative financial assets are derecognised if the group’s contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if
the group transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control or substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
non-derivative financial liabilities are derecognised if the group’s obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.
non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through the profit or loss, any
directly attributable transaction costs. subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described further.
non-derivative financial instruments are recognised on a gross basis unless a current and legally enforceable right to off-set exists and the
group intends to either settle the instrument net or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
upon initial acquisition the group classifies its financial instruments in one of the following categories, which is dependent on the purpose
for which the financial instruments were acquired.

(a) cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, restricted cash and other short-term highly liquid invest-
ments with maturities of less than three months. bank overdrafts are included within borrowings and are classified as current liabilities on the
statement of financial position except where these are repayable on demand, in which case they are included separately as a component of
current liabilities. in the statement of cash flows, overdrafts are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.

(b) loans and receivables
loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. they
are included in current assets, except for instruments with maturities greater than 12 months from the reporting date, which are classified
as non-current assets. the group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables (including related party receivables) which are
stated at their cost less impairment losses.




52                                                                                                                                www.lynascorp.com

(c)    held-to-maturity investments
held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the
group has the positive intention to hold to maturity. subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and allocating the interest over the
relevant years. the effective interest method results in an interest rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts over
the expected life of the financial instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net amount of the financial instrument.

(d) available-for-sale financial assets
available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the
other categories. they are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the
reporting date.
available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value on initial recognition plus transaction costs. subsequent to initial recognition,
the assets are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on availa-
ble-for-sale monetary items, are recognised directly in equity. when an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is
transferred to the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss.

(e) other liabilities
other liabilities comprise all non-derivative financial liabilities that are not disclosed as liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. other
liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12
months after the reporting date. the group’s other liabilities comprise trade and other payables and interest bearing borrowings, including
compound instruments and those with related parties. the group’s other liabilities are measured as follows:

(i)    trade and other payables
       subsequent to initial recognition trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

(ii)   interest bearing borrowings including related party borrowings
	subsequent to initial recognition interest bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
  method.

(f)    compound financial instruments
compound financial instruments issued by the group comprise convertible notes that can be converted to share capital at the option of the
holder, with the number of shares to be issued being fixed.
the liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar financial liability that does not
have the equity conversion option. the equity component is recognised initially as the difference between the fair value of the compound
financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the financial liability component. any directly attributable transaction costs are then
allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
subsequent to the initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. the equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition.
interest related to the financial liability is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss. on
conversion the financial liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.


3.4 derivative financial instruments
a derivative financial instrument is recognised if the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of an instrument at the trade date.
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value (which includes, where applicable, consideration of credit risk), with
transaction costs being expensed as incurred. subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit
or loss unless the derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting. where a derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge
accounting, recognition of any resulting gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship (see further).
derivative financial instruments are recognised on a gross basis unless a current and legally enforceable right to off-set exists.
derivative financial assets are derecognised if the group’s contractual right to the cash flows from the instrument expire or if the group
transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control or substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
derivative financial liabilities are derecognised if the group’s obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.

(a) cash flow hedges
changes in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly in equity as a compo-
nent of other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. to the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair
value are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss for the year.


lynas corporation limited | 2015 annual report                                                                                                          53

financial statements
notes to the financial statements continued




3. summary of significant accounting policies continued

if a hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or it expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge
accounting is discontinued prospectively. at this point in time, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until
the forecast transaction occurs. when the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying
amount of the asset when it is recognised. in all other cases the amount recognised in equity is transferred within the statement of compre-
hensive income in the same year that the hedged item affects this statement and is recognised as part of financial income or expenses. if the
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred within
the statement of comprehensive income and is recognised as part of financial income or expenses in the profit or loss.

(b) fair value hedges
changes in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument designated as a fair value hedge are recognised in the statement of comprehen-
sive income as a component of the profit or loss in financial income or expenses together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged
assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk.

(c)     embedded derivatives
embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the following conditions are met:
     •• the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related;
     •• a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and
     •• the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.

at the time of initial recognition of the embedded derivative, an equal adjustment is also recognised against the host contract. the adjust-
ment against the host contract is amortised over the remaining life of the host contract using the effective interest method.
any embedded derivatives that are separated are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised through net financial expense
in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss.


3.5 inventories
(a) raw materials, work in progress and finished goods
inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. the cost of inventories is based either on the first in first out (“fifo”)
or weighted average principles and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location
and condition. in the case of manufactured or refined inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production
overheads based on normal operating capacity. net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. inventory expected to be sold or consumed within the next 12 months is classified as
current, with amounts expected to be consumed or sold after this time being classified as non-current.

(b) engineering and maintenance materials
engineering and maintenance materials (representing either critical or long order components but excluding rotable spares) are measured at
the lower of cost and net realisable value. the cost of these inventories is based on the weighted average principle and includes expenditure
incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. net realisable value is determined with
reference to the cost of replacement of such items in the ordinary course of business compared to the current market prices.


3.6 property, plant and equipment
(a) recognition and measurement
items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (if any).
cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. the cost of property, plant and equipment acquired in
a business combination is determined by reference to its fair value at the date of acquisition. the cost of self-constructed assets includes the
cost of materials and direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use.
cost may also include transfers from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property,
plant and equipment. purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of the cost of
that equipment.

(b) assets under construction
assets under construction are transferred to the appropriate asset category when they are ready for their intended use. assets under
construction are not depreciated but tested for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication of impairment.

(c)    borrowing costs
borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an item of property, plant and equipment are capitalised until such
time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. the interest rate used equates to the effective interest on debt where general
borrowings are used or the relevant interest rate where specific borrowings are used to finance the construction.

(d) subsequent costs
the cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that
the future economic benefits embodied within that part will flow to the group and its cost can be measured reliably. the carrying amount of
the replaced part is derecognised. the costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss as incurred.

(e) depreciation
depreciation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss or capitalised as a component
of inventory in the statement of financial position (which is subsequently released to the profit or loss through the cost of goods sold on
the sale of the underlying product) using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits embodied within the asset are
consumed. generally this is on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part or component of an item of property, plant and
equipment.
the estimated useful lives for the material classes of property, plant and equipment are as follows:
leasehold land                       30 to 99 years                     buildings                    5 to 30 years
plant and equipment                  2 to 30 years                      fixtures and fittings        2 to 15 years
leasehold improvements               15 to 30 years                     motor vehicles               8 years
depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed on an annual basis.
gains and losses on the disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds (if any) at the time of
disposal with the net carrying amount of the asset.


3.7 mineral exploration, evaluation and development expenditure
(a) exploration and evaluation expenditure
exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area of interest. exploration and evaluation
expenditure includes:
   •• researching and analysing historical exploration data;
   •• gathering exploration data through topographical, geochemical and geophysical studies;
   •• exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;
   •• determining and examining the volume and grade of the mineral resource;
   •• surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements;
   •• conducting market and finance studies;
   •• administration costs that are directly attributable to a specific exploration area; and
   •• licensing costs.

these costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through the successful development of the area of
interest, or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of
economically recoverable reserves.
a regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to
that area of interest. accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area of interest are written off in full in the statement of comprehensive
income as a component of the profit or loss in the period in which the decision to abandon the area is made.

(b) development expenditure
once an area of interest has been established as commercially viable and technically feasible, expenditure other than that relating to land, build-
ings and plant and equipment is capitalised as development expenditure. development expenditure includes previously capitalised exploration
and evaluation expenditure, pre-production development expenditure and other subsurface expenditure pertaining to that area of interest. costs
related to surface plant and equipment and any associated land and buildings are accounted for as property, plant and equipment.
development costs are accumulated in respect of each separate area of interest. costs associated with commissioning new assets in the
period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are capitalised. development costs incurred after the
commencement of production are capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit.
when an area of interest is abandoned or the directors decide that it is not commercially viable or technically feasible, any accumulated
costs in respect of that area are written off in full in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss in the
period in which the decision to abandon the area is made to the extent that they will not be recoverable in the future.

financial statements
notes to the financial statements continued




3. summary of significant accounting policies continued

development assets are assessed for impairment if the facts and circumstance suggest that the carrying amount exceed the recoverable
amount. for the purpose of impairment testing, development assets are allocated to the cash-generating units (“cgus”) to which the
development activity relates.

(c)    deferred stripping
overburden and other mine waste materials are often removed during the initial development of a mine in order to access the mineral
deposit. this activity is referred to as development or pre-production stripping. the directly attributable costs associated with these activities
are capitalised as a component of development costs. capitalisation of development stripping ceases and amortisation of those capitalised
costs commences upon extraction of ore. amortisation of capitalised development stripping costs occurs on a straight line basis with
reference to the life of mine of the relevant area of interest.
removal of waste material normally continues through the life of a mine. this activity is referred to as production stripping and commences
upon the extraction of ore.

(d) amortisation of development
amortisation of development is recognised either in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss or
capitalised as a component of inventory in the statement of financial position (which is subsequently released to the profit or loss through
the cost of goods sold on the sale of the underlying product) on a units of production basis which aims to recognise cost proportionally to
the depletion of the economically recoverable mineral resources. costs are amortised from the commencement of commercial production.


3.8 intangible assets
(a) research and development
expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technological knowledge and understanding,
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss as incurred.
development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. development
expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technologically and commercially
feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use
or sell the asset. the expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overhead costs that are directly attributable
to preparing the asset for its intended use. other development expenditure is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a
component of the profit or loss as incurred.
intangible assets arising from development activities are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses (if any).

(b) other intangible assets
other intangible assets comprise internally developed software (which is capitalised in accordance with the group’s policy in respect of
research and development as outlined at note 3.8(a)). other intangible assets have finite useful lives and are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses (if any).

(c)    subsequent expenditure
subsequent expenditure in respect of intangible assets is capitalised only when the expenditure increases the future economic benefits
embodied in the specific asset to which the expenditure relates and it can be reliably measured. all other expenditure, including expenditure
on internally generated goodwill and other intangibles, is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit
or loss as incurred.

(d) amortisation
amortisation is recognised in either the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss or capitalised as a
component of inventory in the statement of financial position (which is subsequently released to the profit or loss through the cost of goods
sold on the sale of the underlying product) on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill
and indefinite life trademarks, from the date that the intangible assets are available for use. the estimated useful lives for the material classes
of intangible assets are as follows:
software/technology – 4 to 5 years


3.9 impairment
the carrying amounts of the group’s assets are reviewed regularly and at least annually to determine whether there is any objective
evidence of impairment. an impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount.
impairment losses directly reduce the carrying amount of assets and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a
component of the profit or loss.


56                                                                                                                                www.lynascorp.com

(a) impairment of loans and receivables and held-to-maturity financial assets
the recoverable amount of the group’s loans and receivables and held-to-maturity financial assets carried at amortised cost is calculated
with reference to the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective
interest rate computed at the date of initial recognition of these financial assets). receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
impairment losses on individual instruments that are considered significant are determined on an individual basis through an evaluation
of the specific instruments’ exposures. for trade receivables which are not significant on an individual basis, impairment is assessed on a
portfolio basis taking into consideration the number of days overdue and the historical loss experiences on a portfolio with a similar number
of days overdue.
the criteria that the group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include:
   •• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor;
   •• a breach of contract, such as default or delinquency in respect of interest or principal repayment; or
   •• observable data indicating that there is a measureable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a portfolio.

(b) non-financial assets
the carrying amounts of the group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. if any such indicators exist then the asset or cgu’s recoverable amount is estimated. for goodwill and intangible assets that
have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, recoverable amounts are estimated at least annually and whenever there is an
indication that they may be impaired.
an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cgu exceeds its recoverable amount. a cgu is the smallest iden-
tifiable asset group that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups. impairment losses are recognised in
the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss. impairment losses recognised in respect of a cgu are allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cgu and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other non-financial
assets in the cgu on a pro-rata basis.
the recoverable amount of an asset or cgu is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. in assessing the value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu. in assessing the fair value less cost to sell, the company uses a variety
of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. the methods used to determine
fair value include a discounted future cash flow analysis and adjusted ebitda (forecasted) multiplied by a relevant market indexed multiple.
in respect of assets other than goodwill, impairment losses recognised in prior years are assessed at each reporting date for any indications
that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine
the recoverable amount. an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s revised carrying amount will not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.


3.10	  assets and liabilities classified as held for sale
assets (or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities) that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through
continuing use are classified as held for sale. immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets or components of a disposal
group are re-measured in accordance with the group’s accounting policies. thereafter the assets (or disposal groups) are measured at the
lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. upon reclassification the group ceases to depreciate or amortise non-current
assets classified as held for sale. any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill and then to the remaining assets on a
pro-rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets or employee benefit assets, which continue
to be measured in accordance with the group’s accounting policies. impairment losses incurred on the initial classification as being held for
sale and subsequent gains or losses on re-measurement are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the
profit or loss. gains are not recognised in excess of any prior cumulative impairment loss.


3.11      employee benefits
(a) pension and superannuation obligations
a defined contribution pension and superannuation plan is a plan under which the employee and the group pay fixed contributions to a
separate entity. the group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions in relation to an employee’s service in the
current and prior years. the contributions are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss as
and when they fall due.

(b) short-term employee benefits
short-term employee benefits are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed in the statement of comprehensive income as a
component of the profit or loss as the related services are provided. a provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under
short-term cash bonus plans and outstanding annual leave balances if the group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this
amount as a result of past services provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.




lynas corporation limited | 2015 annual report                                                                                                   57

financial statements
notes to the financial statements continued




3. summary of significant accounting policies continued

(c)    other long-term employee benefits
the liability for long service leave for which settlement can be deferred beyond 12 months from the balance date is measured as the present
value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees. consideration is given to expected future wage
and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. expected future payments are discounted using market yields
at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated
future cash outflows.

(d) termination benefits
termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal,
to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement date. termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are
recognised if the group has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted and the number of
acceptances can be estimated reliably.

(e) incentive compensation plans
the group recognises a liability and associated expense for incentive compensation plans based on a formula that takes into consideration
certain threshold targets and the associated measures of profitability. the group recognises a provision when it is contractually obligated or
when there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation to its employees.


3.12       provisions
a provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably,
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation. provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
liability. where discounting is used, the increase in the provision for the passage of time is recognised as a financial expense in the statement
of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss.

(a) warranties
a provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold. the provision is based on historical warranty data
and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.

(b) business closure and rationalisation
a provision for business closure and rationalisation is recognised when the group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and
the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced. future operating costs are not provided for.

(c)    rehabilitation
the mining/extraction and refining/processing activities of the group give rise to obligations for asset and site rehabilitation. rehabilitation
obligations can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, land rehabilitation and site
restoration. the extent of work required and the associated costs are estimated based on feasibility and engineering studies using current
restoration standards and techniques. provisions for the cost of each rehabilitation programme are recognised at the time that the environ-
mental disturbance occurs.
rehabilitation provisions are initially measured at the expected value of future cash flows required to rehabilitate the relevant site,
discounted to their present value. the value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds. when
provisions for rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing part of the cost of acquiring
the future economic benefits of the operation. the capitalised cost of rehabilitation activities for the group’s mining operations is recognised
as a component of “development expenditure”, whereas those relating to its refining operations are recognised as a component of either
“buildings” or “plant and equipment”. amounts capitalised are depreciated or amortised accordingly.
where rehabilitation is expected to be conducted systematically over the life of the operation, rather than at the time of closure, a provision
is made for the present obligation or estimated outstanding continuous rehabilitation work at each balance sheet date with the costs
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss in line with the remaining future cash flows.
at each reporting date the rehabilitation liability is re-measured to account for any new disturbance, updated cost estimates, changes to
the estimated lives of the associated operations, new regulatory requirements and revisions to discount rates. changes to the rehabilitation
liability are added or deducted from the related rehabilitation asset and amortised accordingly.

(d) onerous contracts
present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. an onerous contract is considered to exist
where the group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic
benefits expected to be received from the contract.




58                                                                                                                                 www.lynascorp.com

3.13      royalties
royalties are treated as taxation arrangements when they have the characteristics of a tax. this is considered to be the case when they are
imposed under government authority and the amount payable is calculated by reference to revenue derived (net of any allowable deduc-
tions) after adjustment for temporary differences. for such arrangements, current and deferred tax is provided on the same basis as described
in note 3.20(a) for other forms of taxation. obligations arising from royalty arrangements that do not satisfy these criteria are recognised as
current provisions (as outlined in note 3.12) and included as part of the cost of goods sold in the statement of comprehensive income as a
component of profit or loss.


3.14      dividends
dividends to the group’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the group’s statement of financial position in the period in which the
dividends are declared.


3.15      share capital
ordinary shares are classified as equity. costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the
proceeds.
where equity instruments are reacquired by the group, for example, as a result of a share buy-back, those instruments are deducted from
equity and the associated shares are cancelled. no gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and the considera-
tion paid including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is directly recognised in equity.


3.16      share-based payment
share-based remuneration benefits are provided to employees via a variety of schemes which are further set out in note 31.
the fair values of the options granted under these various schemes are recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding
increase in equity. the fair value is measured at the grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become
unconditionally entitled to the options.
the fair value at grant date is independently determined using an option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of
the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend
yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option.
the fair value of the options granted is measured to reflect the expected market vesting conditions, but excludes the impact of any
non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and production targets). non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions
about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. at the end of each reporting period, the group revises its estimates of
the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. the employee benefits expense recognised each period takes into account
the most recent estimate. the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as
a component of profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.


3.17      revenue
(a) sale of goods
revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of sales commissions, returns and
allowances, trade discounts, volume rebates and other customer incentives. revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of
ownership have been substantially transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return
of goods can be estimated reliably, and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods.
transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale.

(b) government grants
government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the group will comply with the
conditions associated with the grant. grants that compensate the group for an item which is to be expensed are recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income on a systematic basis in the same years in which the expenses are recognised or, for expenses already incurred
the grants are recognised in the year in which they become receivable. grants that compensate the group for the cost of purchasing,
constructing or otherwise acquiring a long-term asset are recognised as a reduction in the cost of that asset and included in the statement
of comprehensive income as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with the group’s depreciation policy.

(c)    dividend income
dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

(d) royalties
royalty revenue is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement (provided that it is probable
that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably). royalties determined on a time
basis are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreement. royalty arrangements that are based on production, sales and
other measures are recognised by reference to the underlying arrangement.

3. summary of significant accounting policies continued

3.18       lease payments
minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the outstanding
liability. the finance charges which are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss are
allocated to each year during the lease term so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. contingent
lease payments are accounted for in the years in which the payments are incurred.
payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss on
a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which
economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. contingent lease payments arising under operating leases are recognised as an
expense in the year in which the payments are incurred.
in the event that lease incentives are received to enter into an operating lease, such incentives are deferred and recognised as a liability. the
aggregated benefits of the lease incentives are recognised as a reduction to the lease expenses on a straight-line basis, except where another
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.


3.19       financial income and expenses
financial income comprises interest income, foreign currency gains and gains on derivative financial instruments in respect of financing
activities that are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss. interest income is recognised
as it accrues using the effective interest method.
financial expenses comprise interest expense, foreign currency losses, impairment losses recognised on financial assets (except for trade
receivables) and losses in respect of financing activities on derivative instruments that are recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income as a component of the profit or loss. all borrowing costs not qualifying for capitalisation are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss using the effective interest method.


3.20       income tax
(a) income tax
income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. income tax expense is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a
component of the profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in
which case it is recognised with the associated items on a net basis.
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method of providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the carrying amounts for taxation purposes. deferred tax is not recognised for the
following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not
a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and
jointly controlled entities to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future and the group is in a position to control
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences. deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the
temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.
a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised. deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised.
additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time the liability to pay the related dividend
is recognised. deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the same jurisdiction are offset in the statement of financial position only to the
extent that there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred balances relate to taxes
levied by the same taxing authority and are expected either to be settled on a net basis or realised simultaneously.

(b) tax consolidation
the company and its wholly-owned australian resident entities have formed a tax-consolidated group with effect from july 1, 2002 and are
therefore taxed as a single entity from that date. the head entity within the tax-consolidated group is lynas corporation limited. current tax
liabilities and assets and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and relevant tax credits of the members of the tax-consolidated
group are recognised by the company (as head entity in the tax-consolidated group).
entities within the tax-consolidated group have entered into a tax sharing agreement with the company. the tax sharing agreement entered
into between members of the tax-consolidated group provides for the determination of the allocation of income tax liabilities between the
entities should the company default on its tax payment obligations or if an entity should leave the tax-consolidated group.
the effect of the tax sharing agreement is that each member’s liability for tax payable by the tax-consolidated group is limited to the
amount payable to the head entity under the tax funding arrangement.



60                                                                                                                                 www.lynascorp.com

3.21       sales tax, value added tax and goods and services tax
all amounts (including cash flows) are shown exclusive of sales tax, value added tax (“vat”) and goods and services tax (“gst”) to the extent
the taxes are reclaimable, except for receivables and payables that are stated inclusive of sales tax, vat and gst.


3.22       leases
leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
lessee. all other leases are classified as operating leases.

(a) the group as lessor – finance leases
amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the group’s net investment in the leases.

(b) the group as lessee – finance leases
upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum
lease payments. the corresponding liability to the lessor is included within loans and borrowings as a finance lease obligation. subsequent to
initial recognition, the liability is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy described at note 3.3(f) and the asset is accounted
for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.


3.23       earnings per share
(a) basic earnings per share
basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the company, excluding any costs of
servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial period,
adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial period.

(b) diluted earnings per share
diluted earnings per share adjusts the amount used in the determination of the basic earnings per share to take into account the after
income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number
of additional shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. potential ordinary
shares are treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share from continuing
operations.


3.24       segment reporting
the group’s operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group that are regularly reviewed by

3.25       company entity financial information
the financial information for the company entity as disclosed in note 35 has been prepared on the same basis as that applied by the group,
except as set out below:

(a) investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture entities
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture entities are accounted for at cost in the financial information of the company.
dividends received from associates are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a component of profit or loss, rather than
being deducted from the carrying amount of these investments.

(b) effect of tax consolidation
current tax liabilities and assets and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and relevant tax credits of the members of the
tax-consolidated group, are accounted for by the company rather than by the members of the tax-consolidated group themselves.

4. critical accounting estimates and assumptions
in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, management has made certain estimates and assumptions about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities, income and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. management has not made any
significant judgements apart from those involving estimations (as discussed further). the key assumptions concerning the future and other
key sources of uncertainty in respect of estimates at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial reporting period are as listed below.




62                                                                                                                                www.lynascorp.com

4.1 reserve estimates and mine life
reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the group’s mining tenements. in order
to calculate reserves, estimates and assumptions are required to be formulated about a range of geological, technical and economic factors
including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transportation costs, refining costs, commodity demand,
commodity prices and exchange rates. estimating the quantity and/or grade of reserves requires the size, shape and depth of the ore bodies
or field to be determined by analysing geological data such as drilling samples. this process may require complex and difficult geological
judgement and calculation to interpret the data.
as the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period, and because additional geological data is generated
during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may change from period to period. changes in reported reserves may affect the
group’s financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including:
   •• asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in the estimated future cash flows; and
   •• depreciation and amortisation charges in the statement of comprehensive income may change as result of the change in the useful
       economic lives of assets.


4.2 income taxes
the group is subject to income taxes in multiple jurisdictions which require significant judgement to be exercised in determining the group’s
provision for income taxes. there are a number of transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during
the ordinary course of business. current tax liabilities and assets are recognised at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the
taxation authorities.


4.3 realisation of deferred tax assets
the group assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets with reference to estimates of future taxable income. to the extent that actual
taxable income differs from management’s estimate of future taxable income, the value of recognised deferred tax assets may be affected.
deferred tax assets have been recognised to offset deferred tax liabilities to the extent that the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected
to be realised in the same jurisdiction and reporting period. deferred tax assets have also been recognised based on management’s best
estimate of the recoverability of these assets against future taxable income. deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the same jurisdiction
are off-set in the statement of financial position only to the extent that there is a legally enforceable right to off-set current tax assets and
current tax liabilities and the deferred balances relate to taxes levied by the same taxing authority and are expected either to be settled on a
net basis or realised simultaneously.


4.4 impairment of non-financial assets
impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair
value less costs of disposal and its value in use. the fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales
transactions, conducted at arm’s length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. the value
in use calculation is based on a 25 year discounted cash flow (dcf) model. the cash flows are derived from the three year budget and forecast
model that is extrapolated over 25 years and do not include restructuring activities that the group is not yet committed to or significant future
investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the cgu being tested. the recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used
for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.
assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable.


4.5 exploration, evaluation and development expenditure
the group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in certain items of expenditure being capitalised for an area
of interest where it is considered likely to be recoverable by future exploitation or sale or where the activities have not reached a stage which
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves. this policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions
as to future events and circumstances, in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. any such
estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. if, after having capitalised the expenditure under the policy,
a judgement is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to the statement of
comprehensive income.
development activities commence after project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management and the board. judgement is applied by
management in determining when a project is economically viable. in exercising this judgement, management is required to make certain
estimates and assumptions similar to those described above for capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure. any such estimates and
assumptions may change as new information becomes available. if, after having commenced the development activity, a judgement is made
that a development asset is impaired, the appropriate amount will be written off to the statement of comprehensive income.


4.6 restoration and rehabilitation expenditure
the group’s accounting policy for its restoration and rehabilitation closure provisions requires significant estimates and assumptions such as:
requirements of the relevant legal and regulatory framework; the magnitude of possible contamination; and the timing, extent and costs of



lynas corporation limited | 2015 annual report                                                                                                   63

financial statements

4. critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued

required closure and rehabilitation activity. these uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently
provided. the provision recognised is periodically reviewed and updated based on the facts and circumstances available at the time. changes
to the estimated future costs for operating sites are recognised in the statement of financial position by adjusting both the closure and
rehabilitation asset and the provision.



5. determination of fair values
a number of the group’s accounting policies and associated disclosures require the determination of fair values for both financial and
non-financial assets and liabilities. fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following
methods. where applicable, further information regarding the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific
to that asset or liability.


5.1 trade and other receivables
the fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest
at the reporting date. given the short-term nature of trade receivables the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.


5.2 investments in equity securities
the fair value of investments in listed equity securities is determined by reference to their quoted bid price at the reporting date.


5.3 derivatives
the fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available. if a listed market price is not available, then fair
value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity
of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds).
the fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes. these quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future
cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the measurement date.
the fair value of commodity and other price derivatives is based on a valuation model. the valuation model (which includes where relevant
the consideration of credit risk) discounts the estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract using forward
curves and market interest rates at the reporting date.


5.4 non-derivative financial liabilities
the fair value of non-derivative financial liabilities, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated by discounting the future
contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates that are available for similar financial instruments. we consider these inputs to be
level 2 fair value measurements as described in note 28.6.



6. segment reporting
aasb 8 operating segments (“aasb 8”) requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of
the group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision makers (“codm”) in order to allocate resources to the segment and
to assess its performance.
at year end, the group’s codm are the board of directors of the company, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, the vp
production and the vp sales & marketing. information reported to the group’s codm for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment
of performance currently focuses on the operation of the group’s integrated rare earth extraction and process facilities.
the group has only one reportable segment under aasb 8 being its rare earth operations. the codm do not review the business activities
of the group based on geography.
the accounting policies applied by this segment are the same as the group’s accounting policies. results from operating activities represent
the profit earned by this segment without allocation of interest income and expense and income tax benefit (expense). the codm assess the
performance of the operating segment based on adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda is defined as net profit before income tax expense, net of
financial expenses, depreciation and amortisation and adjusted to exclude certain significant items, including but not limited to such items as
employee remuneration settled through share-based payments, restructuring costs, unrealised gains or losses on derivatives, gains or losses
on the sale of non-strategic assets, asset impairments and write downs.
revenues by geographical location, based on invoicing as a percentage of total revenues, comprise: japan 51%, china 23%, vietnam 16%,
france 7% and other 3% (2014: japan 58%, china 22.1%, france 10.1% and other 9.8%). the majority of the group’s non-current assets are
located in malaysia.

japan australia rare earths b.v. (jare) loan facility
the jare loan facility for usd225 million was received from a special purpose company established by sojitz corporation and japan, oil, gas
and metals national corporation (“jogmec”). the proceeds of the jare loan facility funded capital expenditure required for phase 2 of the
rare earths project, enabling the company to increase planned production capacity of rare earth oxide (“reo”) to 22,000 tonnes per annum
from the expected phase 1 production capacity of 11,000 tonnes per annum.
the jare loan facility is secured over all of the assets of the group, other than the malawi assets. pursuant to a binding term sheet dated
september 24, 2014, the parties agreed that all of the senior lender’s securities will remain in place for the term of the jare facility.
interest on the principal accrues daily on the basis of the actual number of days based on a 360 day year and is payable semiannually.
the rate of interest for the first quarter of the year was the libor published semi-annual rate plus a margin of 5.25%. for the remaining
3 quarters, rate of interest increased to a nominal rate of 7%.
pursuant to a binding term sheet dated march 12, 2015, the senior lender and lynas agreed to reduce the cash flow burden of the jare loan
facility on lynas, including by deferring the repayments previously due on march 31, 2015 and june 30, 2015 until june 30, 2016. the senior
lender and lynas also agreed that each interest payment that is due in calendar year 2015 will be deposited into a restricted bank account,
with the payments available, at the lender’s discretion, for reuse in the lynas business.
during the current year, the principal repayment due on september 30, 2014 was paid by its due date.
on august 17, 2015 the company announced that it had agreed on a long term debt structure with its debt providers. the new maturity date
of this facility is june 30, 2018. interest is paid into a restricted bank account in the name of lynas. interest liabilities will only be paid to the
lenders to the extent that, from june 30 2016 onwards, there is a total cash balance (unrestricted and restricted funds) in excess of aud60m.
the balance in the restricted accounts is available, at the lenders’ discretion, for reuse in the lynas business. the company has agreed an
interest regime which provides lynas with the ability to reduce the effective interest rate on the jare facility from 7% per annum to a floor
of 2.8% per annum over time. the initial interest rate is unchanged at 7% per annum, however the new framework sets specific targets that,
if met, will effect a cascading decrease in the interest rate payable on the facility.
the principal repayments due prior to maturity under the jare facility have been adjusted significantly.

under the new agreement, lynas has the ability to reduce the effective interest rate on the jare facility from 7% to a minimum floor of
2.8% over time. this is based on meeting certain milestones as shown below.

if the target of 3,840 tonnes is not met by june 30, 2016, lynas agrees to start up sx5 train 4 production. lynas is continuously assessing the
appropriate time to start up sx5 train 4 which is largely dependent on market conditions.

scheduled repayments
each time a scheduled repayment is fully paid on or before its scheduled repayment date, the interest rate decreases by 0.3% per annum
effective from the day after the repayment is made.

principal prepayments
if, at any time on or before december 21, 2016, the total repayment and prepayment amount (including the usd20m already repaid by
october 2, 2014) is equal to or greater than usd50m, the interest rate decreases by 1.0%. an additional 0.5% reduction applies if, at any
time on or before june 30, 2017, the total repayment and prepayment amount (including the usd20m already repaid by october 2, 2014)

mt kellett convertible bonds
on january 24, 2012, the company executed binding documentation for a usd225 million unsecured convertible bonds issue (the
“convertible bonds”) with mt kellett capital management (“mt kellett”), a us-based investment firm. initially funding for the convertible
bonds was received on january 25, 2012 (usd50 million) with the final payment of usd175 million being received on february 28, 2012.
none of the convertible bonds had been converted into shares as at the end of the financial year.
the convertible bonds are unsecured. each bond entitled the holder to convert to one share at a conversion price of aud0.5634 per share
(at a set exchange rate of usd1.00 = aud0.9533). conversion may occur at any time between july 25, 2012 and the maturity date. the
conversion price may be adjusted as a result of certain equity related transactions such as the issue of shares, payment of dividends, rights
issues or redemptions.
interest is payable quarterly on the convertible bonds at 2.75% per annum. pursuant to a binding term sheet dated march 12, 2015, lynas
and the convertible bondholders led by mount kellett agreed to reduce the cash flow burden of the convertible bonds on lynas by agreeing
that each interest payment that is due in calendar year 2015 will be deposited into a restricted bank account, with the payments available, at
the lender’s discretion, for reuse in the lynas business.
on august 17, 2015 the company announced that it had agreed on a long term debt structure with its bondholders. the maturity of the
bonds has been extended from july 25, 2016 to september 30, 2018.
the interest coupon on the bondholder facility remains at 2.75% for the duration of the loan. the interest payment dates are set at 30 june
and 31 december each year. interest payable on the bonds in respect of the interest periods ending 31 march, 30 june, 30 september, 31
december 2015 and 31 march 2016 are deferred until 30 june 2016 without penalty.
the convertible bond facility contains the same mechanism as the jare facility for payment of interest into restricted bank accounts in the
name of lynas. interest liabilities will only be paid to the lenders to the extent that there is a total cash balance (unrestricted and restricted
funds) in excess of aud60m after june 30, 2016. the balance in the restricted accounts is available, at the lenders’ discretion, for reuse in the
lynas business.

restoration and rehabilitation
the activities of the group give rise to obligations for asset and site restoration and rehabilitation at the lamp in malaysia and the mount
weld concentration plant. the key areas of uncertainty in estimating the provisions for these obligations are set out in note 4.6.
an initial provision of $16.3 million was established during 2013 in respect of the group’s future costs to decommission, restore and
rehabilitate the lamp in malaysia. these costs arise from the ongoing construction and operation of phase 1 of the lamp. the provision was
recognised following the successful commissioning of the phase 1 operations at the lamp during june 2013. subsequent to the commence-
ment of commissioning of phase 2 of the lamp in malaysia in the 2014 financial year, an independent assessment of site rehabilitation
and restoration was performed which resulted in the group increasing this provision to $27.5 million. upon cessation of operations, the site
including the processing assets, ancillary facilities, utilities and the onsite storage facility will be decommissioned and any materials removed
from the location. the group has used third party specialists to assist in estimating these costs and will review these estimates periodically
over time as the operations continue to develop.
the provision for the restoration and rehabilitation of the mount weld mining operations and concentration plant site remains unchanged
from june 30, 2014.

financial statements
notes to the financial statements continued




26. provisions continued

for the provision at the lamp, a corresponding increase in property plant and equipment has been recognised on the group’s balance
sheet. reference should be made to notes 21 and 22 respectively for details on the corresponding assets at the lamp and mount weld. the
unwinding of the effect of discounting of the provision is recognised as a finance cost.

onerous contracts
the provision for onerous contracts represents the expected value of obligations arising under ‘take or pay’ clauses of non-cancellable supply
agreements that the group is currently contracted to. the provision at june 30, 2014 represented management’s estimate of the value
of materials that the group would be unable to take under these contracts over the life of the agreement as well as the unpaid value of
materials not delivered under the agreement through to june 30, 2014.
during the year, the group continued to review this provision and has been increasing it based on production output and usage rates.
subsequent to reaching a new agreement with the supplier, most of the provision had been reversed with the balance of $7m allocated to
trade and other payables. refer to the asx announcement on july 17, 2015 for more details.

28.2       market risk
market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices will affect the
group’s cash flows or the fair value of its holdings of financial instruments. the objective of market risk management is to manage and
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.

(a) foreign exchange risk
as a result of the group’s international operations, foreign exchange risk exposures exist on purchases, assets and borrowings that are
denominated in foreign currencies (i.e. currencies other than the functional currency of each of the group’s operating entities). the currencies
in which these transactions are primarily denominated are the aud, usd and the malaysian ringgit (“myr”).
the group takes advantage of natural offsets to the extent possible. therefore, when commercially feasible, the group borrows in the same
currencies in which cash flows from operations are generated. generally the group does not use forward exchange contracts to hedge
residual foreign exchange risk arising from receipts and payments denominated in foreign currencies. however, when considered appropriate
the group may enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk arising from specific transactions.
the group’s primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is on the translation of net assets of group entities which are denominated in
currencies other than aud, which is the group’s presentation currency. the impact of movements in exchange rates is recognised primarily in
the other comprehensive income component of the group’s statement of comprehensive income.
certain subsidiaries within the group are exposed to foreign exchange risk on purchases denominated in currencies that are not the
functional currency of that subsidiary. in these circumstances, a change in exchange rates would impact the net operating profit recognised in
the profit or loss component of the group’s statement of comprehensive income.
effective from january 24, 2012, the functional currency of lynas corporation limited (the parent) changed from aud to usd, following the
issue of the usd225 million mt kellett convertible bonds.

exposure to foreign exchange risk
the group’s members are exposed to foreign exchange risk on financial assets and financial liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies
i.e. currencies other than the functional currency of each member of the group. whilst a member of the group with myr as its functional currency
is exposed to usd and aud, another member with usd as its functional currency is exposed to aud. this exposure on financial assets and
liabilities by currency, which has potential impact on the profit or loss component of the statement of comprehensive income, is detailed below:

                                                                                                       aud               usd             total

sensitivity analysis
a change in exchange rates would impact future payments and receipts on the group’s financial assets and liabilities denominated in
differing currencies to each respective member of the group’s functional currency. a 10% strengthening or weakening of these currencies
against the respective group member’s functional currency, at the reporting date, would have increased (decreased) the reported profit or
loss for the year by the amounts shown. this analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. the same
basis has been applied for all periods presented.

a change in exchange rates would also impact the translation of net assets of group operations whose functional currencies are denominated
in currencies other than aud, which is the group’s presentation currency. a 10% strengthening or weakening of these currencies against the
group’s presentation currency, at the reporting date, would have increased (decreased) the reported net asset. this analysis assumes that all
other variables remain constant. the same basis has been applied for all periods presented.

(b)         interest rate risk
the group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings at both fixed and floating rates and deposits which earn interest at floating
rates. borrowings and deposits at floating rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk. borrowings at fixed rates expose the group
to fair value interest rate risk.
the group’s primary exposure is to both floating and fixed interest rates on borrowings in australia denominated in usd.
interest rate risk on borrowings is partially offset by the group as it has a component of its cash deposits in both floating and fixed rate
accounts.

the group’s sensitivity to interest rate risk can be expressed in two ways:

fair value sensitivity analysis
a change in interest rates impacts the fair value of the group’s fixed rate borrowings. given all debt instruments are carried at amortised
cost, a change in interest rates would not impact the statement of comprehensive income as a component of the profit or loss or the
statement of financial position.

cash flow sensitivity analysis
a change in interest rates would have an impact on future interest payments and receipts on the group’s floating rate assets and liabilities.
an increase or decrease in interest rates of 50 basis points at the reporting date would negatively or positively impact both the statement
of financial position and profit or loss through the statement of comprehensive income by the amounts shown, based on the assets and
liabilities held at the reporting date and a one year time frame. this analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency
rates, remain constant. the analysis is performed on the same basis for comparative periods.

(c)     commodity and other price risk
commodity and other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes
in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the
individual financial instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market.


28.3       credit risk
credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations, and arises principally from the group’s receivables from customers and related entities.
the group’s exposure to credit risk is primarily in its trade and other receivables and is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of
each customer. demographically there are no material concentrations of credit risk.


28.4       liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not meet its contractual obligations as they fall due. the group’s approach to managing liquidity
risk is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due and comply with covenants under
both normal and stressed conditions.
the group evaluates its liquidity requirements on an on-going basis and ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected
operating expenses including the servicing of financial obligations. this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot
reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
the following table sets out contractual cash flows for all financial liabilities including derivatives.

(1) 	the cash coupon on the instrument of 2.75% is payable on the $us225 million principal. the weighted average effective interest rate is 8.07% on the mt kellett
      convertible bonds. this rate is impacted by the unwinding of the equity component of the instrument which is recognised as a component of the group’s net
      financing expenses.

the group did not have any financial assets or financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss at june 30, 2015
(june 30, 2014: none).
the methods used in determining fair values of financial instruments are discussed in note 5.


28.6       fair value measurements recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
subsequent to initial recognition, the group measures financial instruments at fair value grouped into the following levels based on the
degree to which the fair value is observable.
   •• level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets;
   •• level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for
      the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
   •• level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not
      based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
as at june 30, 2015, the group did not hold any available for sale financial assets (june 30, 2014: none) that were classified as level 1
financial instruments. the group did not hold any level 2 or level 3 financial instruments as at june 30, 2015 (june 30, 2014: none).

the compensation of each member of the kmp of the group for the current and prior year is set out within the remuneration report.
the share-based payments amount represents the cumulative impact of amortising the accounting value of options and performance
rights over their three year vesting period including the impact of forfeitures recognised during the period. at times, a negative value may
be presented which results from the forfeitures recognised in the period (which may relate also to earlier periods) are greater than the
accounting expense for the current portion of the vesting period.

lynas corporation limited is the ultimate controlling party of the group. balances and transactions between the company and its subsidi-
aries, which are related parties of the company, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

financial statements
notes to the financial statements continued




31. employee share option plan
the group has established an employee share plan whereby, at the discretion of directors, options and performance rights may be granted
over the ordinary shares of the company for the benefit of directors, executives and certain employees of the group. the options and perfor-
mance rights which are issued are granted in accordance with performance guidelines established by the nomination and remuneration
committee. each option or performance right is convertible into one ordinary share of the company during the two years following the
vesting date, which is the third anniversary of the grant date. the exercise price for the options is not less than the vwap for the five days
preceding the date the option is granted. the options or performance rights hold no voting or dividend rights, and are not transferrable.
options and performance rights are granted for the benefit of key management personnel (“kmp”) and other selected employees to provide
greater alignment to our strategic business objectives. kmp are those people who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and
controlling the major activities of the group, directly or indirectly, including any executive director of the group and the executive. at year end,
the executive includes, the chief executive officer (“ceo”), the chief operating officer (“coo”), the chief financial officer (“cfo”), the group’s
general counsel and company secretary, the executive vice president people and culture, and the executive vice president corporate affairs.

employee share trust (“est”)
options and performance rights that are issued for the benefit of selected executives are issued for market value to the lynas est. at the same
time, the est makes an advance to the executive equivalent to the value of the options and/or performance rights to enable the executive to
subscribe for an equivalent number of units in the est. there is no net cash impact for the group arising from those arrangements.

notes:
the ore reserve estimation for the central lanthanide deposit is as per the lynas asx announcement dated october 5, 2015. the company
confirms that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimated mineral resources and ore reserves continue to
apply and have not materially changed.
the 2015 ore reserves were estimated utilising updated modifying factors covering mining costs, processing costs, selling prices, selling
costs and mill recoveries. modifying factors covering geotechnical parameters, mining dilution and mining recovery factors were unchanged
from those applied in prior studies. given the mt weld project is in operation, and historical empirical data exists for the mining operation,
the confidence of the modifying factors applied is high. considering the number of changes to the modifying factors there has been little
change to the ore reserves from 2014 to 2015. depletion of the stockpiles has reduced the ore reserves by approximately 30 kt of total reo
and the new unmined ore reserves has reduced by a further 30 kt total reo compared to the 2014 ore reserves. the main change in the
unmined ore reserves compared to 2014 was an increase in tonnes and a reduction in reo grade resulting in similar total reo.
the 2015 ore reserves and mineral resource estimations were estimated on august 31, 2015 to match the availability of personnel to carry
out the work. there have been no material changes to the ore reserves and mineral resources between the end of the financial year and
august 31, 2015.

   confirms that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimated mineral resources continue to apply and have
   not materially changed .figures in the table may not sum due to rounding.
there have been changes to the mineral resource estimations for the duncan deposit and central lanthanide deposit compared to the
2014 mineral resource estimations. re-interpretations of the mineral resource model have been carried out in 2015 to better reflect the
current knowledge of the orebody. the re-interpretations changed a number of parameters including the way the categories were assigned. the
re-interpretations resulted in some changes to the total tonnes, grade and the quantities in each category for each deposit. the overall result
for the central lanthanide deposit was similar tonnes and a lower grade resulting in a reduction of approximately 110,000 tonnes total reo
compared to 2014. approximately 30,000 tonnes of this was depletion of stockpiles. the overall result for the duncan deposit was less tonnes at
a similar grade resulting in a reduction of approximately 45,000 tonnes of total reo compared to 2014.
there have been no changes to the niobium rich rare metals prospect mineral resources since 2014.

1 under listing rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with asx a completed appendix 4g at the same time as it lodges its annual report with asx.

listing rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an asx listing to include in its annual report either a corporate
governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the url of the page on its website where such a statement is located. the
corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the recommendations set by the asx corporate
governance council during the reporting period. if the entity has not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate
governance statement must separately identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not
following the recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period.
under listing rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its annual report, it must
lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with asx at the same time as it lodges its annual report with asx. the corporate governance
statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the purposes of rule 4.10.3.
2 “corporate governance statement” is defined in listing rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in listing rule 4.10.3 which discloses the

extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the asx corporate governance council during a particular reporting period.
3 mark whichever option is correct and then complete the page number(s) of the annual report, or the url of the web page, where the entity’s

corporate governance statement can be found. you can, if you wish, delete the option which is not applicable.
throughout this form, where you are given two or more options to select, you can, if you wish, delete any option which is not applicable and just
retain the option that is applicable. if you select an option that includes “or” at the end of the selection and you delete the other options, you can
also, if you wish, delete the “or” at the end of the selection.
