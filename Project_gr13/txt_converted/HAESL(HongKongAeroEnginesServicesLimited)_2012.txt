the company possesses a significant component repair capability –
up to 90% of the components from engines that it overhauls – and
has developed six ‘centre of excellence’ facilities supporting fan
blade, turbine blade, hp/ip bearing support, honeycomb, seal fin
and engine mount repairs on components from rolls-royce engines
from around the globe.


haesl also provides an ‘on-wing care’ capability to its customers

repairs - using advanced boro-blending repair techniques – either
on location at various airports, or off-site at aircraft maintenance
facilities.

serviced by haesl since the company commenced operations in
1997. haesl also continues to plan for the future, with the ongoing
development of its capability readiness program in order to support
servicing of the trent xwb engine. this engine has been designed
for use on all variants of the airbus a350 xwb aircraft and will have
the lowest carbon emissions of any wide-body aero engine. in
addition, it will be the most environmentally-efficient engine thus far
in the trent family.


haesl remains committed to being an environmentally responsible
company that makes significant contributions to sustainable
development – this is reflected in the company’s vision statement:
“best in the world, best for the world”

    director & general manager’s statement
    as this report was being written in early 2012, haesl celebrated
    15 years since the company commenced its operations in
    january 1997. haesl’s progress since that time, when it was
    transformed from being just a division of haeco to a stand-
    alone joint venture, has been remarkable.  however, in order to
    fulfil the company’s vision of being “best in the world; best for
    the world” we have to go beyond the principles of operational
    excellence on which the company was founded, and live up to
    best-in-class practices of sustainable development.


    in the area of employee safety, the company has made
    significant progress during 2011 through the implementation
    of the “i care, i report” near-miss reporting system into our
    organisation.   this programme was initiated in september
    2010, and 2011 saw its first full year of operation with 625
    reports being filed throughout the year.  with the large influx
    of new employees over the last year   (bringing haesl’s
    headcount to in excess of 1,000 persons for the first time
    at the end of 2011, a number that is still growing fast),
    ensuring that the principles of safety in the workplace are
    embedded in the company’s culture is a key focus for the
    company’s management.  unfortunately, the number of lost-
    time injuries (ltis) rose by one incident in 2011, compared to
    the year before, to a total of nine incidents. however, the two
    measurements used to determine the intensity of these – the

number of ltis per 200,000 man hours; and the number of lost days per injury -                 haesl’s employees continue to engage actively with the community in volunteering
both showed an improvement over 2010.  in 2012 haesl will enhance the “i care,                 for various charitable, community and sporting events.  it is heartening to see the
i report” reporting system by adding a focus on “+ i resolve”.  with an increase in            enthusiasm with which these activities are pursued, and the generosity that our

stakeholder engagement remains a central feature of haesl’s activities.   in
particular, the supplier code of conduct and sustainability policy were both
successfully rolled-out in 2011. engagement with employees continues to be
followed closely, with various channels and opportunities for communication and
feedback.   training and development for staff – whether newcomers or existing
employees – is continually being developed, and an opportunity for celebration of 15
years of haesl was marked by most of our employees and their families attending
an evening’s entertainment at hong kong disneyland in early january 2012.

their views on environmental and social performance within the organisation. haesl remains fully committed to engaging in dialogue and activity with key stakeholders.


during 2011 haesl has implemented its supplier code of conduct and sustainability policy to enhance the level of awareness and engagement within its supply chain. this will remain
a key initiative in 2012 as the haesl sustainable development strategy continues to evolve.

                                           carbon footprint
                                           our carbon footprint is a measure of the impact our activities have on the environment; and in particular on climate change. haesl’s carbon
                                           footprint is mainly attributed to the following factors: consumption of electricity by production processes equipment, the compressed air
                                           plant, air-conditioning and lighting; towngas consumption by the staff canteen for catering services; and the burning of aviation fuel
                                           in engine tests. reducing our carbon footprint is one of the biggest challenges we face. in order to gauge the success of carbon
                                           footprint reduction initiatives, our carbon footprint is measured in units of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents.

     in the year 2011, a total amount of 20,716 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents was recorded – for the most
     part, this can be attributed to electricity and aviation fuel consumption. an increase is observed compared to
     the previous year, which is due to an expansion in business volume and an escalating workload in year 2011.
     the average carbon dioxide equivalent emission per worked manhour was recorded at 8.6 tonnes/hour, a
     0.1% reduction on the previous year.

     material recycling
     we consider recycling an important aspect of our sustainable development. our recycling plan has been
     implemented in daily practice since 2003. recycled materials, including metals, paper products and printer
     cartridges are collected from our workshops and offices and sent to a recognised recycling company.
     approximately 300 tonnes of paper products have been sent for recycling in total.


     waste disposal management
     our daily operations generate a significant amount of solid and chemical waste. by initiating a variety of waste
     management programs, we strive to reduce all waste to an absolute minimum, especially waste destined to
     end up in landfill sites. our initiatives include promoting the use of reusable cups during tea breaks in order to
     reduce usage of disposable paper cups.  source separation of waste is also implemented at all of our facilities
     to encourage employees to separate their waste for recycling.

     since a growing number of reports have been filed on unsafe situations, there has been a large increase
     in corrective actions to be taken. during 2011, it was recognised that solving these issues would be more
     effective if the problem can be solved by the reporter himself/herself, or if a suitable solution can be suggested
     by the reporter/frontline staff. in the coming year, the icir scheme will be escalated to a more complete
     system; not only encouraging staff to report incidences/unsafe situations, but also encouraging employees to
     resolving problems more proactively at source.

     safety campaigns and training programs
     prescription safety glasses programme
     continuing from the success of last year’s programme, haesl will continue to provide appropriate eye
     protection for staff who could be exposed to eye hazards. assessments were made to identify staff that
     required prescription safety glasses. 96 members of staff have enrolled in this programme, and we will ensure
     that personal protective equipment (ppe) is made available as appropriate for all staff members.


     subcontractors monitoring procedures
     along with providing a safe environment to our visitors and subcontractors, monitoring them is also crucial
     to keeping the workplace safe. in 2011, there was an increase in the number of cases of subcontractors
     speeding within haesl premises or using improper tools/unsafe methods to perform their jobs at haesl.
     we will further reinforce our monitoring procedures for subcontractors to ensure all subcontractors obey the
     same rules regarding h&s as our haesl staff, in order to maintain a safe working environment at haesl.

     safety training
     safety training is one of the key elements within our ehs policy, the goal
     being to strengthen staff awareness in matters of safety, and ultimately
     to help our staff consolidate necessary skills into practice. along with
     basic safety training to be given at the beginning of employment,
     frontline staff will also receive specific h&s training subjectively relevant
     to their job area, such as chemical safety, workplace safety, fire safety
     etc. training is arranged for our staff according to a training matrix with
     no regard to their gender. additionally, all ehs workgroup members are
     required to receive further training from the occupational health and
     safety department, in order to qualify as an occupational safety and
     health supervisor.


     the following is the list of training courses that our ehs workgroup
     members attended to attain this qualification:


         occupational safety supervisor (manufacturing)

         basic accident prevention
         safety in manufacturing industry
         basic occupational health

     staff development
     training
     in response to the company’s business growth, we anticipated increasing the number of personnel to meet
     our operational needs. to achieve the best outcome, by the end of 2011 we decided to centralise our staff
     recruitment process. in addition, we have established a comprehensive 160-hour training plan to set recruits
     on the right path before they begin receiving on-the-job training in their designated workplaces.


     training covers an introduction to the company, basic health and safety training, basic engine concepts,
     cd manual reading, parts handling and protection principles, introduction to 5s, a plant tour, etc. new staff
     members destined to be deployed to either of the production departments – component repair or engine
     overhaul workshop - have to attend additional sessions for specific skill training.


     staff benefits
     employee health program
     in today’s busy world, the trend is for individuals to spend more time working and consequently, less time
     concerned about their health. for a long time, haesl has held the belief that an excellent wellness program is
     essential for the health of employees and their families. the haesl heath care scheme covers hospitalisation,
     network clinical visits and primary dental care. at the same time, haesl also provides regular health checks
     for employees aged 40+.


     haesl wellness day 2011
     in addition to the health program that covers employee and dependent sickness, haesl have also tried to
     identify methods to proactively address unhealthy lifestyles, and to promote wellness and reduce illness.


     in october 2011, we invited our medical services provider, quality healthcare, to organise a one-day onsite
     health assessment, which took place on october 14. two assessments were offered to staff members,
     including spinal assessment and chinese medical consultation.


     spinal assessment is a preliminary test pertaining to spinal health that can detect misalignments of the spine

     transportation subsidies
     located in tseung kwan o industrial estate, haesl understands traveling to work can be a headache for
     staff members. therefore, we have instituted a comprehensive plan regarding transportation arrangements for
     our staff. we are cooperating with staff transport company to provide inbound and outbound shuttle services
     connecting different districts in hong kong. regular meetings with staff transport company representatives
     are held to ensure a better service and bus safety. inflationary pressure of transportation costs on our staff has
     also been taken into consideration by the company. in 2011, in addition to the ongoing transportation subsidy
     provided to employees, the company also provided further subsidies to support the increased coach fare.


     recreational facilities
     we are encouraging our staff to participate in recreational activities within the company during breaks,
     lunch hours or after work. the majority of our staff members enjoy playing sports such as tennis, basketball
     and table tennis during their lunch breaks. our activity clubs also organise different sporting events and
     competitions in order to build a stronger bond between colleagues. in addition to these activities, the haesl
     library encourages reading and self-learning habits among staff members. there is also a mini-garden within
     the haesl facility, maintained by volunteers. this has proven to be a popular spot for employees to take a
     walk after lunch.


     haesl encourages staff to have social gatherings to improve work relations, sharing and communication.
     during summer, the company provides free coffee and tea during tea breaks to encourage closer
     communication. in addition, haesl provides a meal discount for all employees to enjoy lunch and late night
     supper on the premises at a low cost.

                                     their understanding of hong kong’s ecological environment. they also
                                     had the chance to explore, learn and adopt an environmentally-friendly
